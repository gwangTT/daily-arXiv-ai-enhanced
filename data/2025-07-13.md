### [1] [Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07115)
*Javal Vyas,Mehmet Mercangoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified automation framework using large language models (LLMs) for fault-recovery planning and process control in chemical engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of chemical processes, workforce shortages, and intricate fault scenarios necessitate adaptable and symbolic reasoning-based automation solutions.

Method: The authors employ Finite State Machines (FSMs) alongside modular agents, including LLM-based planning for proposing recovery sequences, simulation agents for execution, and validator-reprompting loops for refining invalid plans.

Result: Case study results demonstrate 100% valid-path success on FSM tasks and comparable control performance to PID controllers under disturbances on both physical and digital platforms.

Conclusion: Structured feedback and modular agent-based approaches enable LLMs to effectively unify symbolic planning and continuous control for resilient process automation.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

### [2] [BOOST: Out-of-Distribution-Informed Adaptive Sampling for Bias Mitigation in Stylistic Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07134)
*Mridula Vijendran,Shuang Chen,Jingjing Deng,Hubert P. H. Shum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in AI for painting classification by proposing BOOST, an OOD-informed adaptive sampling method that mitigates bias and improves fairness in imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the growing challenge of bias in AI painting classification, particularly when dealing with rarely seen or out-of-distribution (OOD) data, as biases from imbalanced datasets undermine fairness and accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce a novel approach called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning), which employs dynamic temperature scaling and sampling probabilities to better represent all classes in a dataset.

Result: Evaluation on the KaoKore and PACS datasets shows that the method effectively reduces class-wise bias and maintains high performance. Additionally, the authors propose SODC, a new metric for measuring class-wise bias reduction.

Conclusion: BOOST offers a robust and equitable solution for addressing bias in AI art classification models, advancing fairness while maintaining strong classification performance.

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

### [3] [State-Inference-Based Prompting for Natural Language Trading with Game NPCs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07203)
*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Hwidong Bae,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) to improve rule-governed trading systems in games by ensuring dialogue state inference and adhering to contextual norms, achieving high levels of accuracy and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to maintain trust in rule-governed trading systems due to issues like item hallucinations and calculation errors.

Method: SIBP decomposes trading actions into six states using a unified prompt framework, applying state inference, context-aware referencing, and placeholder-based price calculations.

Result: Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues demonstrates over 97% compliance with trading states, more than 95% accuracy in context-specific referencing, and 99.7% precision in calculations.

Conclusion: SIBP provides a practical framework to enhance NPC trading interactions by ensuring rule adherence and computational efficiency, thereby surpassing current baseline methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode
player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable
trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule
adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified
prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and
placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues
demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7%
calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while
outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for
trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

### [4] [Neurosymbolic Feature Extraction for Identifying Forced Labor in Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07217)
*Zili Wang,Frank Montabon,Kristin Yvonne Rozier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of neurosymbolic methods and large language models (LLMs) to detect illicit supply chain activities, emphasizing their advantage in sparse and unreliable data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to devise a method that can detect illicit supply chain activities using limited and often unreliable data, where traditional machine learning may fail.

Method: The authors proposed a neurosymbolic approach using large language models and a question tree framework to extract and classify features from news articles related to illicit activities.

Result: The study compares human and machine classification of news articles, demonstrating a systematic way to highlight differences in performance when identifying forced labor activities.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic methods, combined with the proposed question tree approach using LLMs, offer a promising way to address the data sparsity and unreliability challenges in detecting illicit supply chain activities.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces cmbagent, a multi-agent system automating scientific tasks with 30 LLM-based agents, showcasing success in cosmology and outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate complex scientific research tasks by leveraging specialized capabilities of multiple agents working together without requiring human intervention.

Method: Developed a multi-agent system comprising about 30 LLM-based agents each specializing in specific tasks (e.g., retrieval, coding, interpreting results). Implemented a Planning & Control strategy to coordinate their workflow, enabling the execution of complex research tasks autonomously.

Result: Successfully applied to a PhD-level cosmology problem related to supernova data, achieving superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LLMs, and demonstrated efficacy on benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: Cmbagent represents a significant advancement in autonomous scientific research systems, providing an efficient, human-free solution, with its software and demonstrations made openly accessible to promote further innovation.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

### [6] [Application of LLMs to Multi-Robot Path Planning and Task Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07302)
*Ashish Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning using large-language models as expert planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning is complex and challenging, requiring innovation for better task-solving strategies.

Method: The study applies large-language models as expert planners to improve exploration in planning-based multi-agent tasks.

Result: Large-language models are investigated for their capacity to serve as effective expert planners, facilitating more efficient exploration.

Conclusion: Leveraging large-language models as planners shows potential to address exploration barriers in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Efficient exploration is a well known problem in deep reinforcement learning
and this problem is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning due the
intrinsic complexities of such algorithms. There are several approaches to
efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent
operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is
investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the
application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient
exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.

### [7] [ViDove: A Translation Agent System with Multimodal Context and Memory-Augmented Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07306)
*Yichen Lu,Wei Dai,Jiaen Liu,Ching Wing Kwok,Zongheng Wu,Xudong Xiao,Ao Sun,Sheng Fu,Jianyuan Zhan,Yian Wang,Takatomo Saito,Sicheng Lai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViDove is a multimodal translation agent that uses visual and contextual data to enhance translation quality, outperforming prior models in BLEU and SubER metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of LLM-based translation agents in processing multimodal input and to improve translation quality using visual and contextual information.

Method: ViDove employs a multimodal memory system and long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge, inspired by human translator workflows.

Result: ViDove achieved 28% improvement in BLEU scores and 15% improvement in SubER compared to state-of-the-art baselines. It also introduces a new benchmark (DoveBench) for video subtitling and translation.

Conclusion: ViDove sets a new standard for multimodal translation by enhancing performance and adaptability with novel memory and workflow features, and provides a valuable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

### [8] [On the Impossibility of Separating Intelligence from Judgment: The Computational Intractability of Filtering for AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07341)
*Sarah Ball,Greg Gluch,Shafi Goldwasser,Frauke Kreuter,Omer Reingold,Guy N. Rothblum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies the computational challenges of aligning large language models (LLMs) through filters designed to prevent harmful content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address concerns about LLMs being misused to produce harmful content, with a focus on the feasibility of using filters to mitigate unsafe information.

Method: The authors analyze two types of filters: input prompt filters and output filters, and demonstrate the computational challenges and intractability of these approaches using cryptographic hardness assumptions. They also explore relaxed mitigation strategies and examine their limitations.

Result: Key findings highlight that effective and efficient filtering of harmful prompts or outputs is computationally infeasible. Adversarial prompts can bypass effective filtering, and output filtering is computationally hard under the outlined assumptions.

Conclusion: Safety mechanisms relying solely on external filters (e.g., black-box filtering methods) are insufficient. Instead, the intelligence and judgment of an AI system need to be integrated for alignment.

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

### [9] [Supply Chain Optimization via Generative Simulation and Iterative Decision Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07355)
*Haoyue Bai,Haoyu Wang,Nanxu Gong,Xinyuan Wang,Wangyang Ying,Haifeng Chen,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study proposes the Sim-to-Dec framework for improving supply chain transportation by integrating simulation and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance responsiveness and economic efficiency in supply chain transportation by addressing challenges related to shipping mode strategy design.

Method: The Sim-to-Dec framework consists of a generative simulation module using autoregressive modeling and a history-future dual-aware decision model optimized through iterative interaction with the simulator.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show that Sim-to-Dec improves timely delivery rates and profit.

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec effectively enhances supply chain transportation strategies, meeting critical objectives like responsiveness and economic efficiency.

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

### [10] [DrugMCTS: a drug repurposing framework combining multi-agent, RAG and Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07426)
*Zerui Yang,Yuwei Wan,Yinqiao Li,Yudai Matsuda,Tong Xie,Linqi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DrugMCTS, an innovative framework combining RAG, agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search, which significantly enhances drug repurposing using LLMs without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large language models in scientific reasoning, specifically overcoming the inefficiencies of fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation in effectively utilizing structured scientific data for drug discovery.

Method: The proposed DrugMCTS framework integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and Monte Carlo Tree Search, where five specialized agents work collaboratively to retrieve and analyze molecular and protein data in a structured and iterative manner.

Result: DrugMCTS enables Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to achieve over a 20% improvement over Deepseek-R1 in performance. Experiments on DrugBank and KIBA datasets show higher recall and robustness compared to standard LLMs and deep learning models.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven mechanisms are crucial for enabling LLMs to achieve advanced results in drug discovery applications, as demonstrated by DrugMCTS.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

### [11] [StarDojo: Benchmarking Open-Ended Behaviors of Agentic Multimodal LLMs in Production-Living Simulations with Stardew Valley](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07445)
*Weihao Tan,Changjiu Jiang,Yu Duan,Mingcong Lei,Jiageng Li,Yitian Hong,Xinrun Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarDojo is a new benchmark for AI agents based on Stardew Valley, evaluating performance in production activities and social interactions with over 1,000 curated tasks. State-of-the-art models like GPT-4.1 show significant limitations in this environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks do not adequately evaluate AI agents' simultaneous abilities in both production-focused tasks and social interactions, which are essential for real-world applicability.

Method: Develop StarDojo, a benchmark based on the Stardew Valley game, featuring 1,000 tasks in domains such as farming, crafting, and social interaction. Models are tested in a controlled, user-friendly, and parallelizable simulation environment.

Result: State-of-the-art models, including GPT-4.1, struggle significantly with StarDojo tasks, achieving low success rates due to challenges in domains like visual understanding and multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: StarDojo provides a versatile platform for advancing research into capable, open-ended agents, highlighting areas such as multimodal reasoning that require further innovation.

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

*Oliver Eberle,Thomas McGee,Hamza Giaffar,Taylor Webb,Ida Momennejad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlgEval, a framework to systematically investigate the algorithms large language models (LLMs) learn and use to solve problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the inner workings and emergent algorithms of LLMs is lacking, as research often focuses on performance improvement rather than theoretical and empirical insight.

Method: The authors propose AlgEval, supplementing it with a case study into LLMs’ emergent algorithms like search algorithms, using hypotheses and circuit-level analysis of attention and hidden states.

Result: Their case study demonstrates how to identify and analyze candidate algorithms within LLMs through both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

Conclusion: AlgEval provides a principled pathway for understanding LLM computations, facilitating human interpretability and suggesting efficient training and novel architectures.

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

*Mohamed Siala,Jordi Planes,Joao Marques-Silva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of explanations for ML predictions, particularly in high-risk domains, and focuses on undesired facets of rule-based models such as redundancy and negative overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure rigorous and trustworthy explanations for ML predictions, especially in high-risk contexts where decision making relies on these explanations.

Method: Algorithms are developed to analyze negative overlap and redundancy issues in rule-based ML systems.

Result: Widely used methods for learning rule-based ML models produce rules with negative properties such as redundancy and overlap.

Conclusion: Rule-based ML models have significant negative aspects, requiring careful scrutiny to ensure reliability in high-risk applications.

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance GNN-based models' performance in link prediction tasks within Knowledge Graphs, addressing the limitations of vanilla aggregation methods and exploring inductive settings where entities during testing are unseen in training.

Method: The paper proposes Context Pooling, incorporating graph pooling and developing neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall metrics to assess neighbors' logical relevance for generating query-specific graphs.

Result: The method was tested on two state-of-the-art models across three datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Conclusion: Context Pooling demonstrates significant improvement in GNN-based models for link prediction tasks in Knowledge Graphs, offering generic applicability and better performance in inductive and transductive settings.

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

*Marco Sangalli,Thomas Krak,Cassio de Campos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for applying Dempster-Shafer theory to credal networks, particularly chains, to efficiently infer beliefs with robust uncertainty representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve uncertainty propagation and belief inference in credal networks by addressing limitations in current methods, focusing on computational efficiency and robust outcomes.

Method: A novel framework is proposed for propagating uncertainty in credal networks using belief and plausibility functions within the Dempster-Shafer framework, with methods formalized and compared to traditional sensitivity analysis.

Result: Numerical experiments show that belief-based inference in the proposed framework provides conservative intervals efficiently and demonstrates practical benefits for credal networks, particularly chains.

Conclusion: The proposed belief inference framework is computationally efficient, represents uncertainty robustly, and is especially useful for credal networks, offering a practical alternative to classical methods.

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for
propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains.
The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief
and plausibility functions, combining computational speed with robust
uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based
inference methods and comparing belief-based inference against classical
sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and
limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

*Fedor Rodionov,Abdelrahman Eldesokey,Michael Birsak,John Femiani,Bernard Ghanem,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanQA evaluates spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs using structured indoor layouts and diverse geometric and design-based queries, revealing limitations in their reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in large-language models' ability to consistently reason about real-world layouts and physical constraints.

Method: PlanQA uses structured symbolic representations of indoor scenes and tests LLMs on diverse spatial reasoning tasks, including metric, topological, and interior design constraints.

Result: Current open-source and commercial LLMs show success in basic queries but fail under complex tasks simulating physical and spatial coherence and layout disturbances.

Conclusion: PlanQA highlights deficiencies in today's LLMs for spatial reasoning and aims to inspire advancements in models capable of accurate geometric and spatial inference.

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

### [18] [Stable Preference Optimization for LLMs: A Bilevel Approach Beyond Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07723)
*Chengtao Jian,Kai Yang,Ye Ouyang,Xiaozhou Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has theoretical limitations, such as sensitivity to initialization and improper probability allocation. The study proposes a new bilevel optimization framework with regularization, termed stable preference optimization, improving model alignment and reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to understand the theoretical limitations of DPO, such as its sensitivity to initialization and its tendency to misallocate probabilities, which can lead to reinforced model biases and hinder alignment with human preferences.

Method: A bilevel optimization framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective (stable preference optimization) is introduced. It includes a principled regularization designed to encourage consistent probability shifts toward preferred outcomes and maintain stability in optimization.

Result: Experiments on reasoning and summarization benchmarks demonstrated that the proposed approach improves reasoning accuracy and output alignment with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO.

Conclusion: Stable preference optimization offers a more reliable and interpretable method for language model alignment, addressing DPO's limitations and enhancing outcomes in task performance.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

### [19] [Identification of Violin Reduction via Contour Lines Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07743)
*Philémon Beghin,Anne-Emmanuelle Ceulemans,François Glineur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a method to classify violins as reduced or non-reduced based on their contour line geometry, using photogrammetry-derived 3D meshes and parabola-like curve fitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively study the differences in violin contour lines (U-shaped vs. V-shaped), as observed by experts but previously unquantified, particularly due to size reductions in historical violins.

Method: Analyzed 3D geometric meshes of 25 violins acquired via photogrammetry. Extracted 10-20 contour lines for each violin, fitted parabola-like curves to these lines, and derived numerical profiles using additional computed features. Applied classification techniques to determine size reduction.

Result: Demonstrated that geometry alone can be used to classify violins as reduced or non-reduced with reasonable success, though identification becomes harder with varying levels of transformation. The parameter beta (openness of contour lines) is the most predictive.

Conclusion: The approach provides a method to classify and understand size-reduction alterations in violins using quantitative geometric analysis, though the complexity of violin transformations remains a challenge.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the "Flourishing AI Benchmark," a novel tool to assess AI alignment with human flourishing across seven key dimensions, revealing gaps in existing AI performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a framework for evaluating how AI systems align with holistic human well-being rather than focusing only on technical capabilities or harm prevention.

Method: The FAI Benchmark evaluates AI systems using 1,229 questions across objective and subjective metrics, employing judge LLMs and geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced evaluation across seven dimensions.

Result: Testing on 28 leading language models shows high-performing models scored up to 72/100, but none achieved satisfactory alignment across all dimensions, with flaws particularly evident in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose.

Conclusion: The research underscores the need for AI systems to actively support human flourishing and offers a new framework for guiding AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

*Lu Xu,Jiaqian Yu,Xiongfeng Peng,Yiwei Chen,Weiming Li,Jaewook Yoo,Sunghyun Chunag,Dongwook Lee,Daehyun Ji,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoSE, a skill-oriented Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer activated parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods for large models often require extensive training data and optimization. The authors aim to enhance autonomous driving systems by developing a computationally efficient MoE approach inspired by human learning processes.

Method: The authors propose MoSE, a skill-oriented MoE model, which uses a specialized routing mechanism to facilitate skill-by-skill learning and multi-step reasoning. They annotated driving-specific skills and pretrained a router for hierarchical skill datasets, integrating auxiliary tasks like reasoning and planning without added computational cost.

Result: The MoSE model, with fewer than 3B sparsely activated parameters, shows superior performance on the CODA AD corner case reasoning task, outperforming existing 8B+ parameter models while significantly reducing activated model size by at least 62.5%.

Conclusion: MoSE demonstrates that a skill-oriented, computationally efficient MoE can outperform larger models in autonomous driving tasks, paving the way for more efficient and interpretable end-to-end systems.

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

*Eunsu Baek,Keondo Park,Jeonggil Ko,Min-hwan Oh,Taesik Gong,Hyung-Sin Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for adaptive sensing inspired by biological systems as a more sustainable and efficient approach to AI, instead of the current scaling paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the significant environmental, economic, and ethical costs of scaling AI models, which limit sustainability and equitable access.

Method: The authors propose adaptive sensing, which modulates sensor parameters dynamically to mitigate covariate shifts and enhance efficiency. They provide a roadmap, address technical and ethical challenges, and propose new research directions.

Result: Empirical studies indicate that adaptive sensing allows smaller models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to outperform much larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) that require more data and compute resources.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating adaptive sensing can lead to robust, sustainable, and equitable AI systems, marking a foundational shift in AI methodology.

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

*Samuel Reyd,Ada Diaconescu,Jean-Louis Dessalles*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces algorithms with polynomial complexity to identify actual causes for diverse system categories, addressing limitations in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address criticisms in XAI literature, focusing on the demand for actual causes rather than contributing factors, which is more relevant to non-expert users.

Method: Algorithms with adjustable precision and exhaustiveness were developed to identify actual causes in non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems while maintaining polynomial complexity.

Result: The proposed algorithms successfully identify causes across various system categories, improving precision and exhaustiveness as computational resources increase.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical solution to an NP-complete problem in causality, advancing XAI by efficiently identifying actual causes for non-expert users.

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of large language models in legal analysis by introducing a framework combining prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge graphs, achieving improved legal dispute analysis performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of large language models in analyzing legal disputes, particularly their insufficient legal knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Developed a framework integrating hierarchical prompt engineering and multidimensional knowledge graphs, alongside legal-specific reasoning templates and optimized mechanisms for better understanding and precision.

Result: The enhanced framework showed significant improvement in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate application and deeper understanding of judicial decision-making for complex cases.

Conclusion: This framework provides a novel technical approach for intelligent legal assistance systems, demonstrating its potential to improve accuracy and comprehension in judicial processes.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

### [25] [Meek Models Shall Inherit the Earth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07931)
*Hans Gundlach,Jayson Lynch,Neil Thompson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper claims that the diminishing returns of compute scaling in AI will cause smaller compute models ('meek models') to achieve comparable capabilities to leading models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trends show a significant inequality in AI model performance, driven by a few organizations with access to vast compute resources. This raises concerns about fairness and the monopolization of AI advancements.

Method: The paper uses a combination of theoretical modeling, empirical evidence from benchmark data, and analysis of diminishing returns in compute scaling to argue its thesis.

Result: The findings suggest that the gains in AI capabilities from raw compute diminish substantially, allowing smaller compute models to narrow performance gaps with larger ones.

Conclusion: The results imply that the competitive advantages of large compute resources will fade over time, necessitating a reassessment of AI strategy and policy to address the rising parity between meek models and top-tier systems.

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

*Kiran Tomlinson,Sonia Jaffe,Will Wang,Scott Counts,Siddharth Suri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how generative AI impacts work activities across various occupations using analysis of anonymized user interactions with Microsoft Bing Copilot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the economic effects of generative AI as it becomes widely adopted, especially the types of work activities AI handles effectively.

Method: The authors analyzed a dataset of 200k anonymized Bing Copilot interactions, categorized related work activities, assessed their success, and computed an AI applicability score for occupations.

Result: AI assistance is most commonly sought for information gathering and writing, while AI excels at providing information, writing, teaching, and advising, with high applicability scores for knowledge-intensive occupations.

Conclusion: Generative AI is highly applicable in knowledge work and information-related professions, influencing occupational tasks based on success and education levels.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed solution that enhances the efficiency of Transposed Convolutions on edge devices, achieving up to 4.2x speedup in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transposed Convolutions suffer from inefficiencies like complex output mapping and overlapping sums, causing performance bottlenecks in generative AI models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: The paper introduces MM2IM, a hardware-software co-design that leverages Matrix Multiplication combined with col2IM for efficient TCONV processing. It is implemented using the SECDA-TFLite design toolkit.

Result: MM2IM showed significant performance improvements, including up to 4.2x speedup on specific TCONV layers and outperforming other similar accelerators by at least 2x GOPs/DSP.

Conclusion: MM2IM demonstrates improved speed and energy efficiency, particularly for generative models like DCGAN and pix2pix, making it highly suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: Transposed Convolutions (TCONV) enable the up-scaling mechanism within
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, the predominant
Input-Oriented Mapping (IOM) method for implementing TCONV has complex output
mapping, overlapping sums, and ineffectual computations. These inefficiencies
further exacerbate the performance bottleneck of TCONV and generative models on
resource-constrained edge devices. To address this problem, in this paper we
propose MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed accelerator that combines Matrix
Multiplication (MatMul) with col2IM to process TCONV layers on
resource-constrained edge devices efficiently. Using the SECDA-TFLite design
toolkit, we implement MM2IM and evaluate its performance across 261 TCONV
problem configurations, achieving an average speedup of 1.9x against a
dual-thread ARM Neon optimized CPU baseline. We then evaluate the performance
of MM2IM on a range of TCONV layers from well-known generative models achieving
up to 4.2x speedup, and compare it against similar resource-constrained TCONV
accelerators, outperforming them by at least 2x GOPs/DSP. Finally, we evaluate
MM2IM on the DCGAN and pix2pix GAN models, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2.4x
energy reduction against the CPU baseline.

*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the origins of cognitive biases in large language models (LLMs) by examining factors like pretraining, finetuning, and training randomness through a novel two-step approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the factors contributing to cognitive biases in LLMs and create strategies to mitigate them.

Method: The study used dual experiments: finetuning models with different random seeds to analyze stochastic effects, and cross-tuning instruction datasets between models to assess dataset dependency.

Result: The analysis shows that biases are primarily shaped by pretraining and less influenced by finetuning data or stochastic factors.

Conclusion: Pretraining plays a dominant role in cognitive biases, emphasizing the need to evaluate them with pretraining contexts in mind for effective bias mitigation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop

### [29] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of LLMs for social science surveys, testing their responses to perturbed questions and answers, and identifying consistent biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can reliably act as substitutes for humans in normative social science surveys given their growing use.

Method: Nine diverse LLMs were tested using the World Values Survey (WVS) with a set of 11 question and answer perturbations, amounting to over 167,000 simulated interviews.

Result: All LLMs demonstrated vulnerabilities, including semantic sensitivity and a consistent recency bias favoring the last-presented answer option.

Conclusion: While larger LLMs are more robust, none are immune to biases or perturbations, highlighting the need for robust prompt design when using LLMs for survey research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval is a toolkit for evaluating synthetic text, addressing aspects like downstream utility, fairness, privacy risk, and expert feedback, focusing on applications in healthcare and law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure that synthetic text generated by large language models can effectively and safely be used in high-stakes domains while addressing risks like privacy violations.

Method: The toolkit evaluates synthetic data on several dimensions, including its utility, fairness, privacy risk, distributional differences, and qualitative feedback. It supports both user-uploaded and generated text.

Result: SynthTextEval demonstrated its functionality and effectiveness in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and law, consolidating evaluation metrics for standardized assessments.

Conclusion: SynthTextEval enhances the viability of synthetic text and contributes to improved privacy-preservation in AI development by providing thorough, multi-dimensional evaluations.

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [31] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a safety evaluation protocol specifically for medical large language models (LLMs), incorporating perspectives from patients, clinicians, and general users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluations for medical LLMs overly focus on general safety benchmarks without considering domain-specific concerns or the different user perspectives inherent to the medical field.

Method: The paper proposes a safety evaluation protocol tailored to medical contexts and introduces 'PatientSafetyBench,' a dataset with 466 samples across 5 categories. It applies red-teaming protocols for testing and uses the MediPhi model collection for case studies.

Result: The research establishes a distinct method to evaluate safety in medical LLMs by considering the unique perspectives of patients and clinicians, alongside general safety metrics.

Conclusion: This work fills a crucial gap in medical AI literature by setting safety standards through targeted red-teaming, offering a foundational framework for deploying LLMs safely in healthcare.

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [32] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses interruption detection in collaborative learning settings with overlapping group conversations, presenting a robust AI method and linguistic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teachers need AI support to monitor group interactions in classrooms with multiple overlapping conversations.

Method: Analyzing interruption detection in single and multi-group dialogues and creating an advanced method robust to overlapping speech.

Result: State-of-the-art interruption identification method suitable for classroom deployment and insights into linguistic/prosodic features of interruptions.

Conclusion: The methodology enhances interruption detection in complex group settings, paving the way for improved AI tools in collaborative classrooms.

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework using multiple LLMs to improve the generation of counterspeech against health misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited evidence and control over counterspeech generated by existing methods.

Method: The framework incorporates static and dynamic evidence, combining multiple LLMs for optimized knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement.

Result: The proposed method outperformed baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy. Ablation studies confirmed the framework's components' necessity.

Conclusion: The method proves effective in generating high-quality counterspeech, validated further through human evaluations showing improved quality and preference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel hybrid model combining GNNs and CNNs for processing long text documents efficiently, capable of achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with inefficiency when processing extended texts due to quadratic complexity in transformers.

Method: The proposed architecture integrates GNNs and CNNs with a real-time graph generation mechanism, eliminates padding/truncation, and applies efficient LLM information extraction for sentiment and embeddings.

Result: Graphs generated exhibit semantic organization and favorable structural properties, tested successfully on sentiment analysis and news categorization tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a computationally efficient and effective alternative for text classification tasks, demonstrating competitive performance versus existing methods.

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedReadCtrl, a framework for controlling readability in large language models (LLMs) to make health-related AI outputs more accessible and understandable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare AI applications, such as clinical decision support and patient chatbots, require personalized and comprehensible communication for effective deployment.

Method: The authors developed MedReadCtrl, a readability-controlled instruction tuning framework, enabling LLMs to adjust output complexity while maintaining meaning. It was evaluated on nine datasets and three tasks across medical and general domains.

Result: MedReadCtrl significantly reduced readability instruction-following errors compared to GPT-4 and delivered improved performance on unseen clinical tasks. Experts preferred its outputs 71.7% of the time, especially for low literacy audiences.

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl successfully aligns clinical content with varying readability needs while preserving its medical meaning, offering a scalable method to enhance patient education and equitable access to AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces SynthEHR-Eviction, a pipeline combining LLMs, human annotation, and automatic optimization to extract eviction statuses from clinical notes, creating a large eviction-related SDoH dataset. It demonstrates high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eviction is a critical, understudied social determinant of health connected to housing and mental health issues, but its representation in health records is limited and unstructured, restricting its utilization.

Method: The researchers developed SynthEHR-Eviction, which integrates large language models (LLMs), human-in-the-loop annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) for scalable extraction of eviction-related data from clinical notes.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs using SynthEHR-Eviction achieved superior Macro-F1 scores for identifying eviction (88.8%) and other SDoH (90.3%), reducing annotation effort by over 80% and surpassing other models like GPT-4 variants and BioBERT.

Conclusion: This pipeline facilitates scalable and cost-effective eviction detection, accelerates dataset creation, and generalizes well to other information extraction tasks, providing a valuable tool for addressing eviction as a social determinant of health.

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

TL;DR: This paper explores distilling time series reasoning into smaller, instruction-tuned language models to enhance interpretability, using synthetic datasets and fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop interpretable, small-scale foundational models capable of explaining time series data in natural language, suitable for on-device use.

Method: The paper used synthetic datasets of mean-reverting time series with varied trends and noise levels, annotated them using a multimodal model, and fine-tuned compact Qwen models supervised by these annotations.

Result: The post-trained models demonstrated meaningful interpretive capabilities, assessed by metrics like trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization.

Conclusion: It is feasible to compress time series understanding into compact language models, paving the way for interpretable systems suitable for privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

### [38] [SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441)
*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Self-taught Action Deliberation (SAND) framework to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) agents by enabling deliberation on multiple actions before making decisions. This leads to significantly improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for finetuning LLM agents often result in suboptimal behavior due to the lack of reasoning over alternative actions, which limits exploration and leads to over-commitment on plausible yet inadequate choices.

Method: The SAND framework incorporates self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to synthesize step-level thoughts for better action deliberation. These deliberation trajectories are subsequently used to iteratively finetune the LLM agent.

Result: SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over supervised finetuning and surpasses state-of-the-art agent tuning strategies in two interactive agent tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit action deliberation using the SAND framework enhances the decision-making capabilities of LLM agents by encouraging a more exploratory and comparative approach to selecting actions.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

*Hongzhi Zhang,Jia Fu,Jingyuan Zhang,Kai Fu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents RLEP, a framework that combines reinforcement learning with experience replay to improve the efficiency and accuracy of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models with reinforcement learning is energy-intensive and prone to challenges such as instability and policy drift.

Method: The RLEP framework employs a two-phase process: verified trajectories are collected first and then replayed with new training data during subsequent updates to optimize training efficiency and performance.

Result: RLEP achieves faster convergence and improved performance compared to baseline models, as demonstrated on various benchmarks such as AIME (2024: 38.2% -> 39.9%, 2025: 19.8% -> 22.3%) and AMC-2023 (77.0% -> 82.2%).

Conclusion: RLEP effectively steers large language models towards more productive learning by focusing on high-quality trajectories, offering a more efficient and higher-accuracy approach than traditional RL. The methodology and code are accessible for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a conceptual framework called 'machine bullshit' to understand the loss of truthfulness in large language models (LLMs), introduces the Bullshit Index metric, and empirically evaluates different forms of truth indifference across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the emergent problem of large language models generating outputs indifferent to truth, and to provide deeper insights into their behavior to improve truthfulness.

Method: The authors introduced the Bullshit Index for measuring indifference to truth, designed the BullshitEval benchmark dataset, and performed empirical analyses on datasets like Marketplace and Political Neutrality, alongside fine-tuning methods like RLHF and CoT prompting.

Result: Their results reveal that RLHF amplifies truth indifference (bullshit) and CoT prompting enhances specific forms like empty rhetoric and paltering. Political contexts saw weasel words dominate, indicating systematic issues in AI alignment.

Conclusion: The study underscores the systematic challenges of aligning AI models to behave truthfully and suggests directions for improving their truthfulness in diverse contexts.

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

*Mihir Parmar,Palash Goyal,Xin Liu,Yiwen Song,Mingyang Ling,Chitta Baral,Hamid Palangi,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PLAN-TUNING, a method to improve smaller language models by mimicking task decomposition strategies from large models, yielding notable performance boosts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether leveraging task decomposition strategies, commonly used by large LLMs, can improve the reasoning and task-specific performance of smaller and open-source LLMs.

Method: PLAN-TUNING involves distilling synthetic task decompositions ("planning trajectories") from large LLMs, followed by fine-tuning smaller models through supervised and reinforcement-learning techniques.

Result: Performance of plan-tuned models increases by ~7% on GSM8k and MATH benchmarks, and they also generalize better on out-of-domain datasets like OlympiadBench (+10%) and AIME 2024 (+12%).

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning and task-specific abilities of smaller LLMs by adopting planning-based task decomposition strategies.

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeaR employs careful data curation and reinforcement learning to improve reasoning capabilities of large language models, achieving substantial performance gains across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to overcome limitations in LLM reasoning by avoiding reliance on algorithmic patterns and enhancing core reasoning skills.

Method: TeaR combines curated data with reinforcement learning to optimize reasoning processes, tested on multiple models and benchmarks.

Result: TeaR showed significant performance gains in reasoning tasks, with improvements of 35.9% for Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% for R1-Distilled-7B.

Conclusion: TeaR proves effective in refining LLM reasoning, highlighting the importance of guided learning for better generalized reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates implicit and explicit reward models in language models, discovering generalization gaps due to token-level reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why implicit reward models perform worse than explicit reward models in generalization, despite being nearly identical in design.

Method: Theory and experiments were used to identify the reliance on superficial token-level cues as the root cause for performance issues in implicit reward models.

Result: Implicit reward models showed worse generalization, influenced by token-level distribution shifts, and alternative hypotheses for this behavior were disproved.

Conclusion: Small design choices in reward models significantly affect generalization behavior, urging careful consideration in model construction.

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

*Hein Htet,Amgad Ahmed Ali Ibrahim,Yutaka Sasaki,Ryoji Asahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study proposes a method using named entity recognition and relation extraction with transformer-based models to extract key information about ORR catalysts from scientific literature, demonstrating domain-specific BERT variants' superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The efficiency of fuel cells depends heavily on the performance of ORR catalysts, and extracting structured information from scientific literature is critical yet challenging due to text complexity and diversity.

Method: The study utilized DyGIE++ architecture combined with multiple BERT variants (e.g., MatSciBERT, PubMedBERT). A dataset with 12 critical entities and two relationship types was manually annotated, enabling fine-tuning of the transformer models for better information extraction.

Result: The fine-tuned PubMedBERT achieved the highest NER F1-score (82.19%), and MatSciBERT secured the best RE F1-score (66.10%). Domain-specific BERT models demonstrated better performance than general ones.

Conclusion: The study underscores the efficacy of fine-tuned domain-specific BERT models for automating ORR catalyst information extraction, showcasing their applicability for scalable literature analysis in material science.

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

*Varin Sikka,Vishal Sikka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the computational limits of LLMs, specifically their inability to handle complex computational and agentic tasks and verify their outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limits of LLMs, particularly in computational and agentic tasks, and the issues of hallucinations in real-world applications.

Method: The authors investigate the computational complexity of tasks LLMs can perform, demonstrating their limits with examples.

Result: LLMs are shown to be ineffective at handling tasks or verifying outcomes beyond a certain complexity.

Conclusion: LLMs have inherent computational limits that affect their capability and reliability in complex agentic applications.

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

### [46] [Toward Real-World Chinese Psychological Support Dialogues: CPsDD Dataset and a Co-Evolving Multi-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07509)
*Yuanchen Shi,Longyin Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to create psychological support dialogue datasets using AI, emphasizing non-English languages, particularly Chinese. It fine-tunes language models and develops a support system achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising demand for psychological support highlights the lack of diverse and non-English datasets, necessitating new methods to generate and refine such data.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned two language models: a Dialog Generator to create counseling dialogues using predefined paths, and a Dialog Modifier to enhance these dialogues based on real-world data quality.

Result: The study produced the CPsDD dataset with 68K dialogues and introduced the CADSS system, demonstrating excellent performance in Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support tasks on relevant datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging limited data and expert knowledge, this work advances psychological support dialogue systems and datasets, especially in a Chinese context, setting a new benchmark for AI-driven support tools.

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates predicting turn-taking in triadic conversations using Voice Activity Projection (VAP) trained on acoustic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional turn-taking studies mainly focus on dyadic settings, while triadic scenarios remain underexplored.

Method: The authors trained VAP models on a dataset of Japanese triadic conversations discussing various topics, using acoustic data to predict future voice activity for each participant.

Result: The VAP models trained on triadic conversation performed better than baseline models; however, prediction accuracy varied based on conversation type.

Conclusion: VAP models are feasible for turn-taking prediction in triadic dialogue, with potential integration into spoken dialogue systems in the future.

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

*Akram Elbouanani,Evan Dufraisse,Aboubacar Tuo,Adrian Popescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using carefully designed few-shot prompts with large language models (LLMs) for multilingual subjectivity detection, achieving top rankings in an evaluation campaign.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multilingual subjectivity detection, especially in noisy or low-quality data environments, and evaluate few-shot LLMs as alternatives to fine-tuned SLMs.

Method: Apply few-shot prompting techniques using LLMs, including advanced prompt engineering approaches such as debating LLMs and example selection strategies.

Result: Achieved high performance in the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 across multiple languages, securing first place in Arabic and Polish while demonstrating robustness in multilingual tasks.

Conclusion: LLM-based few-shot methods are effective and adaptable for multilingual sentiment analysis, particularly in settings with scarce or inconsistent labeled data.

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Arabic-English scenarios using domain-specific corporate datasets instead of open-domain sources like Wikipedia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of prior cross-lingual RAG studies which suffered from hidden retrieval challenges due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content.

Method: The authors constructed benchmarks derived from corporate datasets, with user queries and supporting documents in randomly assigned languages, allowing systematic analysis of cross-lingual behaviors.

Result: The study identified retrieval as the bottleneck in cross-lingual scenarios, especially when languages differ between user queries and supporting documents. A retrieval strategy enforcing balanced retrieval across languages improved performance significantly.

Conclusion: Improvements in multilingual retrieval strategies can address critical bottlenecks in cross-lingual domain-specific RAG applications, enhancing practical real-world utility.

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

*Jierun Chen,Tiezheng Yu,Haoli Bai,Lewei Yao,Jiannan Wu,Kaican Li,Fei Mi,Chaofan Tao,Lei Zhu,Manyi Zhang,Xiaohui Li,Lu Hou,Lifeng Shang,Qun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on vision-language models (VLMs) and finds that their combined effectiveness is limited, leading to trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models increasingly use advanced post-training techniques like SFT and RL, but their combined effects have not been systematically studied.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments using various multimodal benchmarks to analyze the individual and joint effects of SFT and RL, including multiple training combinations like staged and interleaved approaches.

Result: SFT improves reasoning for difficult questions but adds verbosity, while RL enhances generalization and brevity. Combining them fails to yield additive benefits, showing trade-offs in reasoning accuracy and style.

Conclusion: The synergy dilemma in combining SFT and RL suggests the need for adaptive methods to optimize reasoning capabilities in vision-language models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIMT aims to translate text from document images but faces challenges due to limited data and cross-modality complexity. M4Doc, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), improves generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance translation performance while addressing generalization limitations stemming from scarce document image data and the intricacies of combining visual and textual modalities.

Method: M4Doc employs a framework to align an image-only encoder with multimodal representations from pre-trained MLLMs, enabling critical visual-textual correlations during training while maintaining computational efficiency during inference.

Result: Experiments show M4Doc delivers significant advancements in translation accuracy and performance in varied domains and challenging document image conditions.

Conclusion: M4Doc offers an effective solution for DIMT by improving generalization, leveraging multimodal knowledge, and ensuring computational efficiency during inference, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

*Cooper Doyle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uncovers the Bayesian underpinnings of discrete-diffusion language models, proposing a lightweight, inference-time ensemble method to enhance token probabilities and uncertainty estimates, achieving significantly better results than GPT-2 Small.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve token prediction capabilities of language models through Bayesian principles while avoiding extra training costs.

Method: A Monte Carlo marginalization technique is used to approximate the posterior over clean tokens based on K corruptions. The method introduces an ensemble averaging K mask-and-denoise passes for better inference.

Result: The approach demonstrates significant improvement with a 8.8 test perplexity on WikiText-2 using K=8, outperforming GPT-2 Small's perplexity of 20.3.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages Bayesian insights to achieve superior performance in language models without additional training complexity.

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

*Joyeeta Datta,Niclas Doll,Qusai Ramadan,Zeyd Boukhers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Distillation (KD) for Question Answering tasks, achieving over 90% performance retention while reducing parameters by up to 57.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform exceptionally well on NLP tasks but are computationally demanding, limiting their use in resource-constrained settings.

Method: The paper uses Knowledge Distillation (KD) to create smaller student models from large teacher models (Pythia and Qwen2.5 families) and evaluates them on SQuAD and MLQA benchmarks under zero-shot and one-shot prompting.

Result: Student models achieve over 90% of the teacher models' performance with parameter reductions of up to 57.1%, and one-shot prompting proves more effective than zero-shot setups.

Conclusion: Efficient and compact QA systems are feasible via KD, balancing performance and resource constraints, particularly with minimal prompting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

*Abhinav Java,Srivathsan Koundinyan,Nagarajan Natarajan,Amit Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates improving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for answering complex questions using large unstructured document corpora. It challenges the need for large-scale fine-tuning to optimize RAG metrics, showing improved prompt design can outperform recent methods. Additionally, supervised and reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning reduce resource usage (retrieval searches) while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods focused on improving accuracy and recall while neglecting efficiency in retrieval searches, which plays a crucial role in resource costs at inference time.

Method: The authors compared techniques that rely on large-scale fine-tuning with an alternative approach using a standard ReAct pipeline enhanced by refined prompts. They also explored supervised and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning methods to reduce retrieval costs for inference.

Result: Large-scale fine-tuning is unnecessary for improving RAG metrics, as an enhanced ReAct pipeline with better prompts achieves state-of-the-art benchmark performance. Additionally, supervised and RL-based fine-tuning significantly improve efficiency (reducing inference-time searches) while maintaining performance, achieving competitive results at nearly half the retrieval cost with minimal training.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that advanced RAG performance does not require extensive fine-tuning, and improved prompt engineering alongside efficient fine-tuning approaches can optimize both accuracy and retrieval efficiency with surprisingly low resources.

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

TL;DR: The paper discusses Chinese content moderation challenges posed by Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), proposes a taxonomy, introduces a dataset, evaluates LLMs, and suggests improvements for toxicity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting toxic content obscured through homophonic variations in Chinese social media, where existing methods fail to account for user creativity.

Method: The study organizes PCR into a four-way taxonomy, compiles a dataset of naturally occurring posts, benchmarks model performance, and revisits prompting strategies to improve detection accuracy.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on the task with F1-scores maxing at 0.672 and even lower performance with certain prompts; the revised Pinyin-based approach shows significant recovery.

Conclusion: The paper provides a new taxonomy, dataset, and mitigation strategy, advancing research in detecting phonetic cloaking in toxic content and revealing the limitations of current detectors.

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

*Andrew D. Foland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NOIR, a metric for evaluating text summarization quality by balancing semantic retention and summary length compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an objective, automated metric to measure summarization quality without relying on human-generated references.

Method: NOIR is developed using a language model-embedding to evaluate semantic similarity, focusing on recall-compression tradeoff.

Result: Experiments show NOIR aligns with human judgment and evaluates summarizer performance based on semantic retention and length compression.

Conclusion: NOIR offers an automated tool for assessing summarization, applicable across diverse tasks, alleviating dependency on manual evaluations.

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Simulated Attention Score (SAS) to improve Transformer attention mechanisms by simulating a larger head count and hidden feature dimension without increasing model size. It achieves performance gains while maintaining parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the observation that increasing attention head count and hidden size per head improves performance, provided the hidden size remains large enough. The goal was to enhance attention capacity without inflating model size and parameters.

Method: SAS achieves this by projecting low-dimensional attention head representations into a higher-dimensional space, effectively simulating a larger model. It also extends the simulation to feature dimensions of query and key embeddings. Additionally, PEAA is proposed to control parameter cost.

Result: Experiments show that SAS delivers significant performance improvements across diverse datasets and tasks, compared to existing Transformer attention variants.

Conclusion: SAS and PEAA collectively enhance the expressiveness and efficiency of attention mechanisms in Transformers, offering a balance between performance gains and parameter cost.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

*Hruday Markondapatnaikuni,Basem Suleiman,Abdelkarim Erradi,Shijing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces K2RAG, a new framework to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods in large language models, achieving better accuracy, faster training, and reduced resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models for knowledge expansion is challenging due to increasing computational costs and inefficiencies, calling for innovative alternatives like improved RAG methods.

Method: The proposed K2RAG framework integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to enhance retrieval quality and operational efficiency. A summarization-based preprocessing step further lowers training costs.

Result: K2RAG improved mean answer similarity to 0.57 and achieved a third quartile similarity of 0.82. It reduced training time by 93%, execution speed by 40%, and VRAM usage to a third of naive RAG systems.

Conclusion: K2RAG effectively addresses limitations of naive RAG systems by offering superior accuracy, efficiency, and scalability in knowledge expansion for large language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

### [59] [Rethinking the Privacy of Text Embeddings: A Reproducibility Study of "Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07700)
*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study reproduces and extends the Vec2Text framework, which demonstrates that embeddings can reveal sensitive information despite assumed privacy, emphasizing risks and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify Vec2Text's claims of reconstructing original texts from black-box embeddings and explore privacy vulnerabilities in NLP systems.

Method: Reproduced Vec2Text, validated key results, performed parameter sensitivity analysis, tested reconstruction of sensitive input, and evaluated embedding quantization as a privacy defense.

Result: Successful replication of original results under ideal conditions, showing reconstruction capability even for sensitive inputs like passwords, alongside limitations like sensitivity to input length.

Conclusion: Text embeddings pose privacy risks, requiring caution and robust defense mechanisms like Gaussian noise and quantization for mitigating sensitive information leakage.

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

*Zhijin Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Selective-DPO, a selective alignment strategy for improving preference alignment in large language models (LLMs) by focusing on high-impact tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Not all tokens contribute equally to the performance of large language models (LLMs), and post-training alignment strategies often overlook this, leading to inefficiency and lower fidelity.

Method: The proposed approach focuses on high-impact tokens within preference pairs, identified through token-level log-probability differences between the current policy and a reference model. It reduces computational overhead while enhancing alignment.

Result: The Selective-DPO method outperforms standard DPO and distillation-based baselines in experiments conducted on benchmarks like Arena-Hard and MT-Bench. Using stronger reference models also significantly improves token selection accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of token-level optimization and the selection of high-quality reference models for improving the preference alignment process in LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper reviews Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in the legal field, introducing a dual taxonomy framework and exploring their capabilities and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic understanding of how LLMs can advance legal reasoning and integrate AI advancements with the legal domain.

Method: The study uses a dual taxonomy integrating legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies, along with technical strategies like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts architectures.

Result: The paper highlights advancements in task generalization, workflow integration, and innovations overcoming text processing and reasoning challenges, while emphasizing ethical and jurisdictional concerns.

Conclusion: The paper offers a roadmap for future research and practical integration of LLMs in legal AI, emphasizing unresolved challenges like jurisdictional adaptation and ethical issues.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

### [63] [StreamUni: Achieving Streaming Speech Translation with a Unified Large Speech-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07803)
*Shoutao Guo,Xiang Li,Shaolei Zhang,Mengge Liu,Wei Chen,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces StreamUni, a Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM) that simultaneously handles speech segmentation, policy decisions, and translations for streaming speech translation (StreamST), aiming to improve latency and translation quality without requiring extensive policy-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in existing streaming speech translation methods, which rely on external segmentation models and struggle with policy decisions and quality due to limited contextual information and the inherent complexities of speech input and cross-lingual generation.

Method: The paper introduces StreamUni, which uses a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM) integrated with speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generating multi-stage outputs. These outputs enable simultaneous speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation. Additionally, the study proposes a streaming CoT training method to enhance low-latency decision-making and generation capabilities.

Result: The experiments show that StreamUni achieves state-of-the-art results on streaming speech translation tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: StreamUni demonstrates that combining a large-scale, unified speech-language model with integrated CoT and a specialized streaming training approach can significantly advance StreamST performance while reducing reliance on extensive, policy-specific training.

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

### [64] [Bridging Logic and Learning: Decoding Temporal Logic Embeddings via Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07808)
*Sara Candussio,Gaia Saveri,Gabriele Sarti,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae using a Transformer-based model, enabling direct optimization in the semantic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continuous learning and optimization in the semantic space of logic formulae, semantic embeddings need to be invertible to translate them back into concrete requirements.

Method: The authors use a Transformer-based decoder-only model trained to invert STL semantic embeddings, leveraging a small STL vocabulary for valid formula generation and generalization to semantics.

Result: The model successfully learns valid formulae after 1 epoch and generalizes to STL semantics within 10 epochs. It generates formulae that are semantically close but simpler than gold references, and works effectively across varying levels of data complexity.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential to decode semantic embeddings back into logic formulae and applies this capability to requirement mining tasks in the semantic space for optimization purposes.

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

TL;DR: This paper studies the link between large language models' ability to identify repetition patterns and their in-context learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how skill neurons, especially repetition neurons, contribute to in-context learning and strategies to optimize LLM outputs.

Method: The authors experiment with repetition neurons at different layers and compare their effects to induction heads in LLMs.

Result: The layer depth of repetition neurons influences the impact on ICL performance, and strategies for reducing repetitive outputs while sustaining ICL abilities are identified.

Conclusion: Repetition neurons play a significant role in balancing repetitive outputs and maintaining robust in-context learning in large language models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

*Anwoy Chatterjee,H S V N S Kowndinya Renduchintala,Sumit Bhatia,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) to enhance instruction tuning by rethinking token weighting in loss functions, improving robustness and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored topic of optimizing loss functions in instruction tuning, particularly the weight assigned to prompt and response tokens.

Method: Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) systematically adjusts the weights of prompt and response tokens during instruction tuning loss computation. The method is experimentally validated across multiple models, datasets, and benchmarks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that standard instruction tuning loss is suboptimal and that WIT achieves superior performance and robustness, especially under varied input prompts.

Conclusion: The study advocates for re-evaluating instruction tuning loss weights, offering insights for creating more generalizable models. WIT serves as a robust foundation for preference alignment training.

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes conditional unigram tokenization, extending traditional unigram tokenization by conditioning on source-language tokens from parallel data, showing mixed results across applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-lingual semantic alignment in tokenization for better performance in language processing tasks.

Method: Extend the unigram tokenization method to condition target token probabilities on source-language tokens, optimizing with a fixed source tokenizer and parallel data.

Result: The method showed consistent perplexity reductions in language modeling but no improvements in machine translation quality.

Conclusion: Quadratic scaling in conditioning causes a data efficiency bottleneck, necessitating alternative parameterizations for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

*Youngjoon Jang,Seongtae Hong,Junyoung Son,Sungjin Park,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how resolving coreferential ambiguity in documents improves the performance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in natural language processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation frameworks are often hindered by referential ambiguity in retrieved documents, which disrupts retrieval relevance and overall generative performance.

Method: The paper systematically analyzes the impact of coreference resolution on document retrieval and generative performance, comparing different pooling strategies and evaluating question-answering tasks.

Result: Coreference resolution enhances retrieval relevance and improves question-answering performance. Mean pooling outperforms other strategies post-coreference resolution, and smaller models benefit more from disambiguation.

Conclusion: Addressing coreferential complexity can significantly improve RAG system performance, aiding smaller models and context capturing. This provides actionable guidance for enhancing knowledge-intensive NLP applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a multi-layered game-theoretic framework for AI alignment using transfinite fixed-point methods, demonstrating the emergence of semantic equilibria naturally through iteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To devise an advanced formal framework for aligning AI systems with documents by introducing hierarchical semantic games, addressing both global and local decision problems effectively.

Method: Employs a composite operator formula for iterative semantic convergence, integrates game-theoretic reasoning, and uses tools like Banach's fixed-point theorem, $\\phi$-topology, and Yoneda lemma for verification.

Result: Establishes existence and uniqueness of semantic equilibria, validates framework through a combination of fixed-point theorems and cognitive simulation models, and demonstrates practical relevance grounded in category and information theory.

Conclusion: The multi-layered architecture successfully aligns AI decision-making via emergent game-theoretic reasoning, offering a robust and practical foundation for AI alignment methods.

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocCHA introduces a modular framework for adaptive clinical reasoning, outperforming LLM-based baselines in diagnostic accuracy and symptom recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CHAs lack adaptive multi-turn reasoning and transparent decision-making, limiting their utility in clinical diagnosis scenarios.

Method: DocCHA uses a modular framework with three stages—symptom elicitation, history acquisition, and causal graph construction—leveraging interpretable confidence scores for adaptive questioning and reasoning refinement.

Result: DocCHA demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy (up to 5.18%) and significant improvement in symptom recall (over 30%) on real-world Chinese datasets compared to existing LLM-based systems.

Conclusion: DocCHA enables structured, efficient, and transparent diagnostic conversations, making it a promising solution for multilingual, resource-constrained clinical settings.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preparation of input files for MD simulations is labor-intensive and error-prone, and automation is needed to streamline this process.

Method: The pipeline combines LLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash), python scripting, Selenium-based web automation, and CHARMM GUI to generate and refine MD input files for NAMD simulations.

Result: The automated approach significantly reduces setup time, minimizes manual errors, and efficiently handles multiple protein systems in parallel.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of applying LLMs in computational structural biology for simplifying and automating MD simulation setups, enabling scalable and hands-free workflows.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

*Guoxin Zang,Xue Li,Donglin Di,Lanshun Nie,Dechen Zhan,Yang Song,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a Vision-Language Model framework designed for industrial anomaly detection and reasoning, addressing challenges in interpretability and generalization with innovative methods and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the difficulty of using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in industrial scenarios where existing models struggle with interpretability, unseen categories, and precise domain-specific anomaly reasoning.

Method: SAGE employs Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) to integrate domain-specific knowledge and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO) to align outputs with expert preferences. A new dataset, AD-PL, is used, and a Multiscale Logical Evaluation (MLE) framework is developed for assessment.

Result: SAGE achieves superior performance in industrial anomaly reasoning tasks under zero-shot and one-shot settings, surpassing existing VLMs.

Conclusion: SAGE enhances anomaly detection and reasoning by addressing domain-specific challenges with innovative methods, achieving improved performance while offering interpretability and generalization.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,

### [74] [MIRIX: Multi-Agent Memory System for LLM-Based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07957)
*Yu Wang,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRIX, a modular memory system for AI agents, which improves personalization, long-term memory, and multimodal capabilities, outperforming existing frameworks in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI memory solutions are limited due to their flat, narrowly scoped design, making it difficult to personalize, abstract, and recall user-specific information effectively.

Method: MIRIX uses a modular structure with six memory types (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault) integrated with a multi-agent framework for dynamic memory management.

Result: MIRIX achieved 35% higher accuracy than baselines on the ScreenshotVQA multimodal benchmark while reducing storage by 99.9%, and achieved state-of-the-art performance (85.4%) on the LOCOMO text-based benchmark.

Conclusion: MIRIX addresses critical challenges in AI memory systems by delivering scalable, multimodal, and personalized memory capabilities, redefining performance standards in memory-based AI applications.

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [75] [Performance and Practical Considerations of Large and Small Language Models in Clinical Decision Support in Rheumatology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07983)
*Sabine Felde,Rüdiger Buchkremer,Gamal Chehab,Christian Thielscher,Jörg HW Distler,Matthias Schneider,Jutta G. Richter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smaller language models, enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), outperform larger models in diagnostic and therapeutic tasks in rheumatology, with less energy usage and cost, but still require expert validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to investigate whether smaller language models, enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation, can provide efficient and cost-effective solutions for supporting clinical decisions in resource-limited healthcare environments like rheumatology.

Method: The performance of smaller language models combined with retrieval-augmented generation was evaluated and compared to larger language models in diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making in rheumatology.

Result: Smaller models with RAG demonstrated better diagnostic and therapeutic performance than larger models, with lower energy demands and cost efficiency suitable for local deployment.

Conclusion: While smaller language models with RAG offer promising benefits for resource-limited healthcare systems, expert oversight is crucial as the models do not yet achieve specialist-level accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedThink-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating medical reasoning in large language models with expert-crafted rationales, and proposes a scalable framework called LLM-w-Ref for assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of large language models in clinical decision-making necessitates robust, scalable, and transparent evaluation methods for their medical reasoning capabilities.

Method: MedThink-Bench consists of 500 medically challenging questions with expert step-by-step rationales, and the authors propose LLM-w-Ref, an evaluation framework combining fine-grained rationales with a LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism to ensure fidelity and scalability.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that LLM-w-Ref aligns closely with expert judgments, and smaller models, like MedGemma-27B, outperformed some larger proprietary models such as OpenAI-o3.

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench sets a new standard for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, enhancing their safe integration into clinical settings.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PyVision enhances visual reasoning by enabling multi-modal LLMs to autonomously create and utilize Python-based tools, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in visual reasoning tasks by moving beyond static workflows and predefined toolsets.

Method: Developed PyVision, a framework where LLMs autonomously create, utilize, and refine Python-based tools to address specific tasks.

Result: PyVision boosted performance significantly, improving GPT-4.1 by +7.8% and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic tooling through PyVision represents a paradigm shift in enabling LLMs to invent and utilize tools, advancing visual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

### [78] [Frontier LLMs Still Struggle with Simple Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07313)
*Alan Malek,Jiawei Ge,Nevena Lazic,Chi Jin,András György,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art language models (LLMs) on simple reasoning tasks and finds significant systematic failures, despite their advanced capabilities in more complex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand why even advanced LLMs fail on simple reasoning problems that are quite easy for humans, despite their remarkable performance on challenging benchmarks like math and coding.

Method: The authors designed procedurally generated reasoning tasks and introduced the 'unpuzzles' dataset to test the LLMs across counting, logic, proof trees, and basic planning under variable complexity. They analyzed failure patterns stemming from statistical shortcuts, intermediate errors, and memorization issues.

Result: LLMs struggle with trivialized versions of tasks and simple procedural reasoning, exhibiting systematic failures such as reliance on memorization and inability to generalize out-of-distribution logic patterns effectively.

Conclusion: The paper underscores significant limitations in the out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of frontier LLMs, emphasizing that simpler tasks can be surprisingly challenging for these models.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

### [79] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model to improve Multimodal Entity Linking by dynamically handling ambiguous and multi-modal content. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses gaps in existing Multimodal Entity Linking systems, specifically problems of mention ambiguity and the need for dynamically selecting relevant modal content.

Method: The proposed model (MMoE) includes components for enhancing mention understanding using descriptions, extracting multimodal features, and dynamically selecting relevant information via intra- and inter-level mixture of experts modules.

Result: Experimental results show that MMoE surpasses state-of-the-art models in Multimodal Entity Linking tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: MMoE provides an adaptive and efficient solution for linking ambiguous mentions in multimodal contexts and advances the capabilities of multilingual knowledge bases.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

*Michael Neumeier,Jules Lecomte,Nils Kazinski,Soubarna Banik,Bing Li,Axel von Arnim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a high-rate two-stream Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for improved early human activity recognition using event-based vision sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance early human activity recognition for safety-critical systems, leveraging rapid event-based vision sensors.

Method: Develop a high-rate two-stream SNN and benchmark it using Top-1 and Top-5 scores on the THU EACT-50 dataset based on varying observation times.

Result: The proposed SNN outperforms prior methods by 2% in final accuracy and is successfully applied to early action-triggering in sports.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for improving early recognition tasks in real-world human-machine interactions.

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation using covariance-based pixel-text loss (CoPT) to leverage domain-agnostic text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation requires annotations that are difficult to collect, highlighting the need for efficient unsupervised domain adaptation methods.

Method: The authors propose CoPT, using text embeddings to train domain-invariant features. Text embeddings are generated via an LLM Domain Template process using a frozen CLIP model.

Result: CoPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Domain-agnostic text embeddings effectively advance state-of-the-art UDA segmentation performance, demonstrating practical improvement and scalability.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework called Recall to expose vulnerabilities in machine unlearning methods for diffusion-based image generation models, emphasizing adversarial image prompts and demonstrating enhanced adversarial effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about harmful or misleading content generation by AI models and the need for robust machine unlearning to selectively remove undesirable concepts.

Method: The paper proposes Recall, which uses adversarial image prompts optimized with guidance from a semantically relevant reference image to evaluate unlearning methods in diffusion models.

Result: Recall was tested across ten unlearning methods and various tasks, consistently outperforming baselines in adversarial effectiveness, efficiency, and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant weaknesses in current unlearning approaches for IGMs, calling for improved mechanisms to enhance safety and reliability in generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing XAI surveys, which lack a modality-aware perspective, do not cover advances in multimodal and vision-language methods, and provide limited practical guidance for biomedical contexts.

Method: A systematic synthesis of XAI methods, categorized through a modality-focused taxonomy, analysis of multimodal and vision-language approaches, and an evaluation of open-source tools and metrics for biomedical applications.

Result: A comprehensive categorization of XAI techniques, identification of modality-specific interpretability challenges, and exploration of emerging roles of multimodal learning and vision-language models.

Conclusion: This survey provides a structured framework and foundation for advancing explainable DL in biomedical image analysis by addressing gaps in prior research and proposing practical future directions.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BASIC, a detailed evaluation framework improving upon current methods for brain visual decoding by incorporating multigranular assessments of structural, semantic, and contextual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for brain visual decoding lack detail, neuroscientific validity, and nuanced assessments of visual differences.

Method: The authors propose BASIC, a multigranular framework focusing on structural fidelity using segmentation-based metrics, semantic comparisons via structured scene representations, and contextual coherence using multimodal models.

Result: BASIC was applied to benchmark various brain visual decoding methods across multiple datasets, revealing enhanced discriminative and interpretive capacities for evaluation.

Conclusion: The BASIC framework provides a robust, comprehensive, and fine-grained approach for evaluating brain visual decoding, addressing the shortcomings of previous protocols.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study focuses on hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) caused by conflicts between different input modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the phenomenon of hallucinations in multimodal LLMs, particularly the modality conflict between vision and language inputs.

Method: The authors define modality conflict formally and construct a dataset called Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC). They propose three methods—prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning—to address hallucinations caused by this conflict.

Result: Experiments using the MMMC dataset reveal that reinforcement learning is the most effective in mitigating hallucinations under modality conflict, while supervised fine-tuning offers stable performance.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of addressing modality conflicts to improve the robustness of MLLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops an autonomous maritime surveillance technique for UAVs using visual cues and on-board vision in GNSS-denied settings, leveraging YOLOv8 for vessel detection and feature analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying target vessels solely via visual cues in GNSS-denied maritime environments, necessary for search and rescue and threat detection applications.

Method: The authors integrate the YOLOv8 object detection model for vessel identification, applying feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis for target verification, and geometric principles for localization.

Result: The proposed method was tested in real-world maritime challenges during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrating GNSS-denied navigation and proving its functionality and accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the method effectively identifies and localizes target vessels with promising accuracy, even under challenging GNSS-denied conditions.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp, a polyp segmentation network using contrastive learning and lightweight modules, achieves improved IoU metrics on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polyp segmentation methods have limitations due to reliance on additional labeled data and task similarity. The goal is to overcome these limitations and enhance segmentation performance without requiring extra annotations.

Method: Utilizes contrastive learning for encoder improvement, MASPP for multi-scale feature fusion, and CA module for boundary reconstruction. Self-supervised strategies eliminate the need for extra labeled data.

Result: CL-Polyp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving IoU improvements of 0.011 and 0.020 on Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is more effective in clinical polyp segmentation, highlighting the potential and practical utility for colorectal cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

Conclusion: Structured semantic mediation enables interpretable and cognitively aligned image reconstruction from EEG signals.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

TL;DR: Current video generative models struggle to produce consistent and coherent long-form videos beyond 16 seconds, with noticeable issues in character and motion consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations in existing video generative models, particularly concerning consistency and quality in producing longer, narrative-driven videos.

Method: The study analyzes 32 papers on video-generation models, identifies key architectural components and training strategies, and develops a novel taxonomy for categorizing these methods.

Result: The study provides a comparative analysis and taxonomy of existing video-generation methods, highlighting effective approaches for long-form videos.

Conclusion: Insights and classifications from this study can guide future research in designing better video generative models for creating consistent and coherent long-form videos.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [90] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Colors See, Colors Ignore" (CSCI), an RGB-based method for Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID), leveraging color as a lightweight solution to mitigate appearance bias and improve re-identification performance without additional annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying individuals in CC-ReID tasks without relying on resource-intensive methods like additional models or annotations, thereby exploring an efficient, lightweight approach.

Method: The researchers propose the CSCI method, which uses color as a proxy for identity features. A novel self-attention mechanism, S2A self-attention, is introduced to separate color-related cues from identity-relevant features, leveraging only RGB data.

Result: The CSCI method demonstrated significant improvements over baseline performances across four CC-ReID datasets, enhancing Top-1 accuracy by up to 5% for image-based ReID and 2.5% for video-based ReID using RGB-only data and no additional supervision.

Conclusion: CSCI shows the potential of color as a cost-effective and annotation-free approach for reducing appearance bias in CC-ReID tasks, enhancing performance while maintaining simplicity in methodology.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

### [92] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)
*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal framework to enhance activity-biometrics identification by disentangling identity features from motion and appearance variations using textual guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional identification tools struggle with activity-biometrics due to entangled identity cues, motion dynamics, and inaccuracies in visual data extraction.

Method: The study introduces DisenQ, a querying transformer that disentangles biometrics, motion, and other features using structured textual supervision instead of traditional visual data inputs.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three activity-based video benchmarks and demonstrates competitive performance in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed language-guided framework proves effective in improving activity-based biometric identification, reducing dependency on traditional visual data while generalizing well across different scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LinguaMark, a benchmark to evaluate multilingual Visual Question Answering capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the biases and linguistic limitations of multimodal models in multilingual settings, encouraging fair and comprehensive evaluation.

Method: The authors designed LinguaMark, a dataset of 6,875 image-text pairs covering 11 languages and evaluated with metrics like Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness.

Result: Closed-source models outperformed overall, while one open-source model (Qwen2.5) showed strong performance in generalizing across languages and social attributes.

Conclusion: LinguaMark serves as a foundational tool for benchmarking multilingual VQA capabilities in LMMs, pushing the boundaries in global AI fairness and accessibility.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if large vision-language models genuinely perform grounded visual reasoning or rely on dataset biases and patterns.

Method: Introduced the MagiC benchmark, containing 6,400 annotated examples, evaluated models using new metrics (MagiScore and StepSense) across multiple dimensions, and tested robustness with adversarial cues.

Result: 15 vision-language models were analyzed, revealing limitations and areas for improvement in grounded visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Current models show significant gaps in truly grounded reasoning, indicating opportunities for advancing multimodal cognitive abilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset creation approach (ADIEE) and an improved Vision-Language Model (LLaVA-NeXT-8B) for automating evaluation of image editing tasks are proposed, achieving superior performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limitations in existing Vision-Language Models (open-source VLMs struggle with alignment; proprietary models are costly and opaque) and the lack of large public datasets for instruction-based image editing evaluation.

Method: The authors introduced ADIEE for automated dataset creation, generating a dataset with 100K+ samples. They fine-tuned a modified LLaVA-NeXT-8B model to numerically score based on this dataset.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperformed state-of-the-art models across benchmarks, improving correlation with human ratings (+17.24%) and pair-wise comparison accuracy (+7.21% and +9.35%). It also enhanced the MagicBrush model's evaluation score.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that automated dataset generation (ADIEE) and fine-tuned scoring models can significantly improve accuracy and practical usability in instruction-guided image editing evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

### [97] [Entity Re-identification in Visual Storytelling via Contrastive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07340)
*Daniel A. P. Oliveira,David Martins de Matos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses issues in visual storytelling systems with cross-frame entity recognition and proposes a new reinforcement learning framework to improve it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual storytelling models struggle to maintain consistent character and object identities across frames, leading to errors like referential hallucinations. The authors aim to address this shortcoming.

Method: The authors propose a contrastive reinforcement learning method, incorporating a dual-component reward function and synthetic examples, to train models to identify and ground entities consistently across image sequences.

Result: The proposed method significantly improved grounding mAP by 14.8%, F1 by 17.1%, and enhanced cross-frame consistency of entities. Structured and grounded storytelling also increased by 23.3%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves entity grounding, re-identification, and storytelling consistency, demonstrating its potential to address challenges in visual storytelling systems.

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

*Haotian Wang,Aoran Xiao,Xiaoqin Zhang,Meng Yang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PacGDC introduces label-efficient techniques for depth completion, synthesizing diverse pseudo geometries using minimal annotation effort and leveraging depth foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of labor-intensive collection of metric depth labels for large-scale datasets in generalizable depth completion.

Method: PacGDC utilizes multiple depth foundation models for scale manipulation and pseudo depth label generation, ensuring projection consistency and incorporating interpolation and relocation strategies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PacGDC achieves strong generalizability across benchmarks, handling diverse scene semantics, scales, and depth sparsity under zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: PacGDC significantly improves data diversity and generalizability in depth completion tasks while reducing annotation effort, providing robustness for unseen environments.

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

### [99] [Adaptive Particle-Based Shape Modeling for Anatomical Surface Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07379)
*Hong Xu,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves particle-based shape modeling (PSM) by introducing mechanisms for better local geometric adaptability and correspondence consistency, optimizing anatomical surface representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing particle-based shape modeling methods lack the capability to self-adapt their configurations to capture local geometric features effectively, limiting their ability to represent complex anatomical variability.

Method: The authors developed two mechanisms: (1) a neighborhood correspondence loss for high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm for consistent particle configurations, ensuring geodesic neighborhood regularization.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved adaptivity and correspondence consistency, achieving higher surface representation accuracy and better performance against benchmarks across challenging datasets.

Conclusion: This work successfully balances adaptivity and neighborhood consistency in particle configurations, advancing the state-of-the-art for anatomical surface modeling and quantification.

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve temporal and spatial modeling capabilities in sports event spotting, addressing the limitations of existing lightweight modules in handling long-term dependencies and focusing on salient regions.

Method: They developed a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift Module (MSAGSM) featuring multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention to enhance modeling efficiency. MSAGSM can integrate with various 2D CNN backbones and requires minimal computational overhead.

Result: MSAGSM outperforms existing methods across five PES benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art performance results.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that MSAGSM is a lightweight and effective solution for enhancing event spotting while introducing a new dataset specifically for table tennis.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

re-identification framework consisting of global and local branches that
leverage human keypoints for enhanced spatiotemporal representation learning.
The global branch captures holistic identity semantics through
Transformer-based temporal aggregation, while the local branch dynamically

*Zhimin Zhang,Bi'an Du,Caoyuan Ma,Zheng Wang,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for transferring motion between different animal species while retaining their distinctive habitual characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion transfer methods are focused on humans, often neglecting the unique habitual behaviors of animals. The authors aim to address this gap for cross-category animal motion.

Method: The paper introduces a generative model with a habit-preservation module and category-specific habit encoder. It leverages a large language model (LLM) for better motion adaptability to previously unseen species.

Result: Experiments using the novel DeformingThings4D-skl dataset demonstrate the model's ability to achieve habit-preserved motion transfer, outperforming alternatives.

Conclusion: The framework successfully advances cross-category animal motion transfer, preserving species-specific behaviors and showing potential for broader applications in animation and virtual reality.

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

*Xinan Zhang,Muhammad Zubair Irshad,Anthony Yezzi,Yi-Chang Tsai,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EscherNet++ is a masked fine-tuned diffusion model for zero-shot novel view synthesis and amodal image completion, offering improved performance and efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis rely on multi-stage, complex pipelines that fail to capture cross-view dependencies and demand high computing resources. The need exists for an end-to-end model that operates more efficiently and effectively.

Method: EscherNet++ applies input-level and feature-level masked fine-tuning to enable end-to-end novel view synthesis and amodal completion. It also integrates with other image-to-mesh models without extra training.

Result: EscherNet++ achieves competitive results in 3D reconstruction with a 95% reduction in reconstruction time. It improves PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks, even with smaller datasets and batch sizes.

Conclusion: The scalable and efficient nature of EscherNet++ demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in occluded reconstruction tasks and generalizes well to real-world scenarios, simplifying 3D reconstruction processes.

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

*Xinyao Yu,Hao Sun,Zeyu Ling,Ziwei Niu,Zhenjia Bai,Rui Qin,Yen-Wei Chen,Lanfen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes EPIC, an efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy for text-image classification, reducing computational costs while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large-scale multimodal models (LMMs) is computationally expensive, prompting the need for efficient strategies for integrating vision and language.

Method: EPIC employs temporal prompts in intermediate layers combined with similarity-based prompt interaction to effectively exchange information between modalities, minimizing trainable parameters.

Result: EPIC achieves reduced computational resource consumption and uses only about 1% of the trainable parameters compared to foundation models. It also delivers superior performance on UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, with comparable results on MM-IMDB.

Conclusion: EPIC addresses the challenge of efficient multimodal integration, demonstrating significant resource savings and strong performance across various datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Conclusion: Corvid represents a significant advancement in multimodal reasoning by addressing limitations in current MLLMs, making notable contributions to complex and structured decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical

*Ling Zhou,Runtian Yuan,Yi Liu,Yuejie Zhang,Rui Feng,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the DSANet framework to enhance automated segmentation of ultrasound video sequences by improving noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging is hindered by substantial noise, which complicates automated lesion or organ segmentation, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The proposed DSANet framework integrates an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module for feature fusion across frames and a Local-and-Global Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module for combining local spatial details with global temporal context.

Result: DSANet outperformed state-of-the-art segmentation methods in accuracy across four benchmark datasets while achieving higher inference speeds compared to video-based models.

Conclusion: The DSANet framework effectively addresses noise-related challenges in ultrasound imaging segmentation, offering a faster and more accurate solution.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Method: Created S\textsc{urprise}3D dataset with human-annotated spatial queries that avoid shortcut biases, covering diverse spatial reasoning tasks.

Result: Initial benchmarks show challenges for state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the dataset's necessity.

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D facilitates progress in spatially aware AI, supporting advancements in embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely

consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the

Conclusion: With the integration of XAI, the proposed approach enhances BWV detection, offering a reliable tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Conclusion: The method is robust and generalizable, validated through ablation studies and qualitative results, with its code set for public release upon publication.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive

*Chang-Hwan Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel GAN-based framework to enhance face image restoration under adverse weather conditions by incorporating Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With intelligent CCTV systems being deployed outdoors, there is a pressing need for face recognition systems that can perform well in adverse weather conditions, which typically degrade image quality and recognition accuracy.

Method: The framework integrates two key components: (1) Local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) to align the statistical distributions of low-quality facial regions with high-quality ones, and (2) Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE) to align low-quality and high-quality encoder representations for weather-agnostic restoration.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art FIR methods, particularly in improving texture fidelity and reconstructing facial structures under challenging weather conditions.

Conclusion: The inclusion of SFFT and DAFE components significantly enhances structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration, making the system more robust to adverse weather conditions.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates video data-privacy issues in Visual Object Tracking (VOT) and proposes a novel generative framework to prevent unauthorized exploitation of personal video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of social media and increasingly abundant user-uploaded videos, often used for training commercial VOT models, has led to data-privacy violations and unauthorized use of private video data.

Method: The authors developed a generative framework for creating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs) with efficient computation, incorporating a temporal contrastive loss to corrupt the learning-ability of VOT trackers.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, exhibiting strong transferability across various VOT models, datasets, and tasks.

Conclusion: The approach ensures video data-privacy while offering scalable protection for large video datasets, addressing limitations of prior methods and advancing privacy preservation in VOT.

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Motivation: The authors observe difficulties in hybrid navigation due to the lack of proper association between SD maps and HD online maps utilized by autonomous vehicles.

Method: The researchers propose a framework called Map Association Transformer (MAT), employing path-aware and spatial attention mechanisms to analyze geometric and topological correspondences.

Result: The OMA benchmark encompasses 480k roads and 260k lane paths, with metrics for evaluation and a novel model that facilitates improved navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper advances the integration of SD and HD maps for autonomous vehicles with the proposed benchmark and framework, aiming to enhance practical navigation efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Result: DMPO achieves at least 64.6% improvement in PickScore across all datasets, surpassing existing baselines in diffusion model alignment.

Conclusion: DMPO offers a principled and effective approach to preference alignment, combining strong theoretical foundations with robust practical results.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GGMotion, a novel group-based graph dynamics-kinematics network for human pose modeling in 3D. It enhances physical plausibility and achieves superior performance in short-term motion prediction benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human pose representation methods overlook physical dependencies between joints, which leads to unrealistic motion predictions. GGMotion aims to improve learning by incorporating group dynamics and kinematics.

Method: The proposed approach models human topology as grouped graphs with inter-group and intra-group interactions and introduces a radial field for spatio-temporal dependency aggregation. Dynamic-kinematic propagation and auxiliary loss further enhance performance.

Result: Experiments on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW benchmarks show improved short-term motion prediction with significant performance margins against existing methods.

Conclusion: GGMotion effectively integrates dynamics and kinematics priors, achieves geometric equivariance, and provides state-of-the-art results in human motion prediction tasks.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

### [118] [MUVOD: A Novel Multi-view Video Object Segmentation Dataset and A Benchmark for 3D Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07519)
*Bangning Wei,Joshua Maraval,Meriem Outtas,Kidiyo Kpalma,Nicolas Ramin,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUVOD, a multi-view video dataset for 4D object segmentation in dynamic scenes, addressing the lack of labeled datasets in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D object segmentation of dynamic scenes is underexplored due to the absence of extensive and accurately labeled multi-view video datasets, which limits research and development in this field.

Method: The authors created a new dataset, MUVOD, consisting of multi-view videos with segmentation masks and introduced benchmarking tasks, evaluation metrics, and a baseline segmentation approach. A subset was also prepared for 3D object segmentation tasks.

Result: The MUVOD dataset includes 17 scenes with 7830 RGB images across 73 categories and 459 instances, offering segmentation masks in 4D motion. A benchmark and evaluation metrics were provided to assess methods in this domain.

Conclusion: MUVOD addresses a gap in 4D and 3D object segmentation research, serving as a benchmark for evaluating methods and encouraging progress in the field.

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

### [119] [Spline Deformation Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07521)
*Mingyang Song,Yang Zhang,Marko Mihajlovic,Siyu Tang,Markus Gross,Tunç Ozan Aydın*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spline-based trajectory modeling approach to improve spatial coherence and temporal interpolation especially in sparse signals, outperforming neural-network-based deformation fields and explicit techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses shortcomings in current trajectory modeling methods, such as limited spatial coherence in neural-network methods and reliance on heuristic initialization in explicit techniques.

Method: The authors use spline-based trajectory representation with explicitly controlled degrees of freedom through knots, leveraging a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding for better spatial and temporal modeling.

Result: The proposed approach improves temporal interpolation of sparse signals and achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, enhancing motion coherence.

Conclusion: Spline-based trajectory representation effectively overcomes the limitations of implicit and explicit deformation models, offering better spatial coherence and dynamic modeling performance without relying on heuristic constraints.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

### [120] [MAPEX: Modality-Aware Pruning of Experts for Remote Sensing Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07527)
*Joelle Hanna,Linus Scheibenreif,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPEX, a remote sensing foundation model, aimed at improving performance and efficiency by utilizing multi-modal data and optimizing model size through pruning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issues of modality mismatch and inefficiency seen in current remote sensing foundation models, which are often large and difficult to fine-tune for specific applications with small datasets.

Method: The model, MAPEX, uses a multi-modal training approach with a novel modality-conditioned token routing mechanism. Additionally, it employs a pruning technique to retain task-specific modality experts for better efficiency.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that MAPEX achieves strong performance across various remote sensing datasets, outperforming fully supervised training methods and other state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: MAPEX enhances the efficiency and applicability of remote sensing foundation models, simplifying fine-tuning and deployment while maintaining strong performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

### [121] [Beyond the Linear Separability Ceiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07574)
*Enrico Vompa,Tanel Tammet,Mohit Vaishnav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies a 'linear reasoning bottleneck' limiting visual-language models (VLMs) in abstract reasoning tasks and introduces the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC) to measure it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why state-of-the-art visual-language models struggle with certain abstract reasoning tasks and pinpoint whether the issue lies in representation quality or reasoning alignment.

Method: The authors use the LSC metric and postfix tuning to analyze reasoning pathways in VLMs, focusing on task-dependent interventions to activate these pathways and improve performance.

Result: The study finds evidence of dormant but powerful reasoning pathways in VLMs that can be activated for semantic tasks, whereas complex relational reasoning requires weight adaptation.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning in VLMs requires task-specific alignment strategies rather than solely improving representation quality.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

### [122] [Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Weakly-Supervised Low-Light Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07578)
*Chunyan Wang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining diffusion-guided knowledge distillation and depth-guided feature fusion to enhance weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the performance degradation of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in low-light scenarios caused by image quality issues and weak supervision constraints.

Method: The proposed method, DGKD-WLSS, uses diffusion-guided knowledge distillation for aligning normal and low-light features and depth-guided feature fusion to integrate illumination-invariant structural priors.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervized semantic segmentation under low-light conditions, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS enhances structural feature learning and robustness to low-light conditions, improving segmentation performance, and its effectiveness is validated experimentally with released source codes.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection
framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on
vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges
in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection
mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:
(1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features
from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature
representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of
97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect
detection.

*Wenfeng Jia,Bin Liang,Yuxi Lu,Attavit Wilaiwongsakul,Muhammad Arif Khan,Lihong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HOTA, a method for creating large-scale 3D flood maps using hierarchical multi-scale inference, Sentinel-2 images, and digital elevation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floods cause significant social and economic damage, and timely, detailed flood mapping is critical for effective disaster response.

Method: HOTA applies overlapping tiles of varying sizes to Sentinel-2 images during inference, paired with the SegFormer model for feature extraction and a digital elevation model differencing technique for depth estimation.

Result: The case study on the Kempsey flood shows HOTA improved segmentation IoU from 73% to 84% and achieved high precision in flood depth measurements.

Conclusion: HOTA provides a scalable and accurate solution for generating 3D flood maps, enhancing disaster response capabilities with minimal retraining requirements.

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

TL;DR: Stable-Hair v2 introduces a diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer framework that ensures consistent, high-quality hairstyles across views, surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods excel at hair modeling but fail in multi-view consistency and quality, crucial for applications like digital humans or virtual avatars.

Method: Stable-Hair v2 uses a novel data generation pipeline (Bald Converter, inpainting model, face-finetuned diffusion) with polar-azimuth embeddings and temporal attention, alongside a multi-stage training strategy for consistency.

Result: The method transfers realistic hairstyles with impeccable view consistency and detail, exceeding the performance of previous approaches in multi-view scenarios.

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 sets a benchmark in multi-view hair transfer by leveraging innovative techniques to achieve unparalleled quality, paving the way for advanced applications in real-world contexts.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve the challenge of combining image semantics with lidar scans for open-vocabulary segmentation, tackling issues of noisy and sparse point labels when transferring information between modalities.

Method: The method refines 3D point cloud labels obtained by back-projecting image semantics. Refinement includes enforcing spatio-temporal consistency and robustness against image-level augmentations, followed by training a 3D network using these consolidated labels.

Result: The proposed method (LOSC) surpasses state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation tasks on benchmark datasets nuScenes and SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of integrating image-based VLMs with lidar data for improving segmentation performance through label refinement and demonstrates its efficacy with strong experimental evidence.

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant

*Siting Wang,Luoyang Sun,Cheng Deng,Kun Shao,Minnan Pei,Zheng Tian,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialViz-Bench is a new benchmark to evaluate spatial visualization abilities in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of spatial visualization in MLLMs are inadequate and often compromised, necessitating a focused benchmark to address this gap.

Method: SpatialViz-Bench was created with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, containing 1,180 automatically generated problems, and was used to evaluate 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: The study found performance variations among MLLMs and identified unexpected behaviors, such as poor alignment between human intuition and model difficulty perception, as well as significant 2D-to-3D performance drops.

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench highlights MLLMs' deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks and serves as a strong tool for addressing this gap in the field.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViLU, a new framework for reliable uncertainty quantification and failure prediction in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainty and predicting model failures, necessitating new approaches to improve reliability.

Method: ViLU integrates visual embeddings, predicted textual embeddings, and image-conditioned textual representations via cross-attention to create a multimodal representation. It uses a loss-agnostic binary classification approach trained with weighted binary cross-entropy loss for uncertainty prediction.

Result: Experiments across datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1k, CC12M, LAION-400M) demonstrate significant gains in failure prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of the architecture and training.

Conclusion: ViLU provides an effective and loss-agnostic uncertainty quantification framework for VLMs, particularly in post-hoc settings. It demonstrates reliability and applicability across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

### [130] [T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633)
*Zhitao Wang,Hengyu Man,Wenrui Li,Xingtao Wang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes T-GVC, a new approach to generative video coding that uses trajectory-guided sparse motion sampling for better reconstruction under ultra-low-bitrate scenarios, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of existing generative video coding methods, such as domain specificity and reliance on high-level text guidance, which lead to unrealistic reconstructions and limited applicability.

Method: The method involves a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to extract motion as sparse trajectory points based on semantic importance, combined with trajectory-aligned loss constraints and training-free latent space guidance in diffusion processes.

Result: T-GVC achieves better performance than traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods in ultra-low bitrate conditions. The approach also demonstrates improved motion control compared to text-guided methods.

Conclusion: The proposed T-GVC framework not only reduces bitrate and preserves critical temporal semantics but also offers precise motion control, setting a new direction for generative video coding based on geometric motion modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods

*F. Xavier Gaya-Morey,Julia Sanchez-Perez,Cristina Manresa-Yee,Jose M. Buades-Rubio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates age-related bias in deep facial expression recognition (FER) systems and proposes methods to mitigate this bias with improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based FER systems often struggle with demographic biases, particularly age-related, rendering them less fair and accurate. The paper aims to address these limitations, especially concerning the elderly population.

Method: Three strategies are proposed for bias mitigation: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss, tested on the AffectNet dataset using explainable AI techniques.

Result: The proposed strategies showed significant improvement in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, especially for challenging expressions such as 'neutral,' 'sadness,' and 'anger.'

Conclusion: Age-related bias can be mitigated effectively through training adjustments, using even approximate demographic labels for enhanced fairness in affective computing systems.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

*Fengqian Pang,Chunyue Lei,Hongfei Zhao,Chenghao Liu,Zhiqiang Xing,Huafeng Wang,Chuyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MolCLIP, a visual language model that combines microscopic cell videos and molecular data for enhanced drug mechanism recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for drug mechanism of action recognition neglect the temporal dynamics of live cells and rely primarily on spatial characteristics of static fluorescence images of cells.

Method: The authors propose MolCLIP, a model that merges live cell video data with molecular data using a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework and a metric learning strategy.

Result: MolCLIP demonstrates significant improvements in performance, achieving 51.2% and 20.5% increases in mAP for drug identification and mechanism of action recognition, respectively, on the MitoDataset.

Conclusion: Integrating video and molecular modalities enhances the ability to analyze dynamic cellular responses to drugs, offering a more effective approach for drug mechanism recognition.

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARNet, a deep learning model designed to predict growth potential in pediatric orthodontics from cervical vertebral maturation features using lateral cephalometric radiographs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of growth potential is critical for optimizing orthodontic treatment strategies in children.

Method: ARNet, an AI-powered model, utilizes keypoint annotation on cervical vertebrae from radiographs, incorporating interactive feedback and a morphology-aware loss function to ensure precision.

Result: ARNet substantially reduces manual annotation workload, achieves high efficiency, and delivers accurate predictions validated on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The research provides a reliable, AI-assisted tool for enhancing pediatric orthodontic diagnostics, improving intervention planning.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

*Feng Liu,Lingna Gu,Chen Shi,Xiaolan Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an architecture named AU-DFER for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition, enhancing deep learning models with Action Unit (AU) knowledge to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition models and improve their effectiveness using AU integration and loss function strategies.

Method: Quantifying AU contributions to expressions, introducing a weight matrix for a priori knowledge, integrating it with deep learning results using an AU loss, and validating it against existing DFER models.

Result: The proposed AU-DFER model outperforms state-of-the-art methods without adding computational complexity, while addressing label imbalance issues in datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating Action Unit knowledge and redesigning the loss function improve DFER effectiveness, tackle data imbalances, and advance the field. Source code is publicly accessible.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

### [135] [Rationale-Enhanced Decoding for Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07685)
*Shin'ya Yamaguchi,Kosuke Nishida,Daiki Chijiwa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a limitation in large vision-language models (LVLMs) regarding their use of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and proposes a new inference-time decoding strategy, rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), to improve faithfulness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the observed issue in LVLMs where they often disregard the generated rationales in multi-modal CoT reasoning, reducing accuracy and grounding of their outputs.

Method: The authors reformulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization problem focusing on rationale-conditional log-likelihood and introduce rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), which coordinates visual and rationale information by multiplying separate image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions.

Result: RED consistently improves multi-modal reasoning performance compared to standard CoT and other decoding methods across various benchmarks and LVLMs tested.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical method to enhance rationale-grounded reasoning in LVLMs, improving both the faithfulness and accuracy of their outputs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

### [136] [Tree-Mamba: A Tree-Aware Mamba for Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07687)
*Peixian Zhuang,Yijian Wang,Zhenqi Fu,Hongliang Zhang,Sam Kwong,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-Mamba, a new method for underwater monocular depth estimation (UMDE), overcoming the limitations of existing techniques and datasets with a novel scanning strategy and a new benchmark dataset, BlueDepth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMDE is challenged by degraded underwater images and poor-quality depth labels in existing datasets. Current methods fail to effectively model structure and depth relationships in underwater images.

Method: Tree-Mamba employs a tree-aware scanning strategy that builds a minimum spanning tree based on feature similarity and aggregates spatial features using bottom-up and top-down traversals for stronger multi-scale representation. Additionally, it introduces a new dataset, BlueDepth, with 38,162 images and reliable depth labels.

Result: Tree-Mamba achieves superior qualitative and quantitative performance in UMDE compared to existing methods, with competitive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba provides significant improvements in underwater depth estimation with innovative scanning strategies and a reliable benchmark, positioning it as a leading solution in UMDE research.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

*Wei Shang,Dongwei Ren,Wanying Zhang,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel deblurring approach combining a mask predictor and motion analyzer for efficient and spatially adaptive blur restoration, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in existing deblurring techniques that inefficiently handle spatially varying blur patterns and waste computational resources.

Method: Developed a trainable mask predictor for identifying blurred regions, structural reparameterization for computational efficiency, and an intra-frame motion analyzer to guide adaptive blur restoration.

Result: Achieved superior performance on local and global blur datasets, reducing FLOPs by 49% compared to state-of-the-art methods like LMD-ViT.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively tackles local motion blur, improves restoration performance, and optimizes computational efficiency, marking a significant advancement in image deblurring.

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CrossVLAD, a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified vision-language models (VLMs), and proposes CRAFT, a region-based attack framework that outperforms prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified vision-language models use flexible instruction-based mechanisms but face security risks from adversarial inputs transferable across tasks, necessitating systematic evaluation of such vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors create CrossVLAD, a dataset with GPT-4-assisted annotations, and propose CRAFT, a region-based attack method with token alignment to systematically evaluate and exploit adversarial vulnerabilities in unified VLMs.

Result: The proposed CRAFT method outperforms existing techniques in cross-task adversarial attack effectiveness and targeted object manipulation on popular VLMs like Florence-2.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of vulnerabilities in unified VLMs, offering effective methods and metrics for assessing and improving their robustness to cross-task adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates whether dataset bias exists in popular open-source chest X-ray datasets by applying transformations and analyzing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand if biases exist in widely-used medical imaging datasets, which could lead AI methods to take shortcuts rather than focus on pathologies.

Method: The authors performed the 'Name that dataset' task on four chest X-ray datasets after applying dataset transformations and tested with various neural networks.

Result: The study demonstrates that biases exist even in medical datasets, as models can identify dataset origins despite transformations.

Conclusion: The paper suggests there is a need for explainable AI research in medical imaging and more diverse open-source datasets to mitigate biases.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

*Théo Danielou,Daniel Tordjman,Pierre Manceron,Corentin Dancette*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method inspired by SegVol to address the challenges of SAM-like approaches in 3D medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to adapt the effectiveness of promptable segmentation, especially seen in 2D models like SAM, to handle the complexities and limitations faced in 3D volumetric medical imaging.

Method: The method involves creating a simplified 3D segmentation approach that reduces inference time and avoids the complexities of sliding-window-based prompt management.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while simplifying implementation and addressing computational limitations.

Conclusion: The work introduces an efficient and effective alternative for 3D volumetric segmentation in medical imaging, overcoming previous challenges with simpler and faster inferences.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) by introducing an energy-based decoding method, achieving improved accuracy and reducing bias in visual question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate object hallucination in LVLMs to ensure their reliable and safe deployment in visual question answering systems.

Method: The proposed method uses an energy-based decoding strategy that dynamically selects hidden states from the layer with the minimal energy score, reducing bias and improving model performance.

Result: The method yields an average accuracy improvement of 4.82% and reduces the yes-ratio bias gap by 8.81% across VQA datasets, enhancing performance on commonly used LVLMs.

Conclusion: The energy-based decoding method is effective in addressing bias and improving the performance of LVLMs on visual question answering tasks without requiring additional modifications to visual inputs or reliance on external models.

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that enhances vision-language models (VLMs) for reasoning over long videos using reinforcement learning, introducing a new dataset, training pipeline, and infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current vision-language models (VLMs) in reasoning over long-duration videos, which require significant advancements in dataset quality, training methods, and efficient infrastructure.

Method: The authors propose a three-component framework: (1) a large-scale dataset (LongVideo-Reason) with 52K video QA pairs; (2) a two-stage training approach using chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a novel training infrastructure, Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), for efficient long video RL using cached embeddings and optimized rollouts.

Result: Their method, LongVILA-R1-7B, achieved superior performance on video QA benchmarks like VideoMME. It also matched Gemini-1.5-Pro in various reasoning tasks and demonstrated consistent performance improvements as input video frames increased. MR-SP delivered up to 2.1x speedups during RL training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in enabling long video reasoning in VLMs, with strong empirical results and publicly available tools supporting RL training across multiple modalities and models.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k

*David Pujol-Perich,Sergio Escalera,Albert Clapés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Side-Tuning approach, Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST), for Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results while reducing parameter counts by 73%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) methods heavily depend on static pre-trained backbones and do not efficiently adapt to new domains. Parameter-efficient side-tuning has potential, but existing methods fail to address the sparse nature of Moment Retrieval tasks.

Method: The authors propose SDST, an anchor-free Side-Tuning architecture, complemented by the Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention mechanism to enhance context modeling. They also integrate the InternVideo2 backbone within the tuning framework, optimizing its performance for VTG tasks.

Result: SDST outperforms existing side-tuning methods and achieves highly competitive or state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA. It accomplishes this with a significant reduction in parameter counts, up to 73% compared to the previous SOTA methods.

Conclusion: SDST and its novel mechanisms tackle the limitations of traditional VTG and side-tuning approaches, demonstrating improved efficiency and competitive accuracy in VTG tasks. The publicly available code broadens the accessibility and reproducibility of its findings.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Motivation: Current visual grounded reasoning models lack a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to test capabilities like visual perception, evidence traceability, and higher-order reasoning.

Method: Develop a benchmark using complex images annotated with detailed QA pairs, reinforce the reasoning and localization training paradigm (TreeVGR) using reinforcement learning.

Result: Testing with TreeBench shows advanced models like OpenAI-o3 perform poorly (54.87% accuracy); TreeVGR improves performance significantly on other benchmarks and TreeBench (+13.4).

Conclusion: Traceable reasoning pathways are critical for advancing visual reasoning; benchmarks like TreeBench and training paradigms like TreeVGR can significantly aid model development.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

*Charlie Budd,Silvère Ségaud,Matthew Elliot,Graeme Stasiuk,Yijing Xie,Jonathan Shapey,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called X-RAFT for aligning cross-modal hyperspectral images in fluorescence-guided neurosurgery, achieving a significant error reduction over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decision-making in fluorescence-guided neurosurgery by enabling real-time quantitative fluorescence measurement through accurate alignment of hyperspectral images under varying lighting conditions.

Method: Introduced X-RAFT, an optical flow model with distinct image encoders for cross-modal input alignment. Fine-tuned the model using a self-supervised approach with flow-cycle-consistency on hyperspectral data.

Result: Achieved a 36.6% error reduction compared to a naive baseline and a 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical flow method (CrossRAFT).

Conclusion: X-RAFT enhances the reliability of quantitative fluorescence measurements in dynamic surgical environments, demonstrating its potential to aid real-time surgical decision-making.

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

*Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Bardia Hejazi,Konstantin Poka,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-based method for efficiently correcting geometric inaccuracies in additive manufacturing using voxel-wise deformation estimates between CAD models and XCT geometries. The method improves accuracy and reduces computation time significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformation in additive manufacturing which affect component performance, particularly the lack of ground truth for registration and the computational difficulty with large XCT volumes.

Method: The paper develops a deep learning-based voxel-wise deformation estimation approach with a dynamic patch-based processing strategy for high-resolution XCT volumes. They also propose a new evaluation metric called the Binary Difference Map (BDM).

Result: The method achieves a 9.2% improvement in Dice Score and a 9.9% improvement in voxel match rate over classic DVC methods, and drastically reduces computation time from days to minutes.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of this method in creating compensation meshes for closed-loop correlations in additive manufacturing. This efficiency and accuracy improvement make it highly valuable for industries, enhancing reliability and reducing resource usage.

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

### [147] [SCOOTER: A Human Evaluation Framework for Unrestricted Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07776)
*Dren Fazlija,Monty-Maximilian Zühlke,Johanna Schrader,Arkadij Orlov,Clara Stein,Iyiola E. Olatunji,Daniel Kudenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOOTER, an open-source framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial attacks by combining statistical human evaluations with comparative studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust frameworks for evaluating unrestricted adversarial attacks, which cannot be adequately validated using traditional methods and norm-bounded metrics.

Method: The authors developed SCOOTER, which integrates large-scale human and model comparison experiments, offers statistical best-practice guidelines, and presents a benchmark dataset with human ratings. They also used GPT-4o as a preliminary analysis tool.

Result: Three color-space and diffusion-based adversarial attacks were confirmed to fail at being imperceptible, GPT-4o partially detected adversarial examples, and over 34K human ratings were obtained on a benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: Current automated vision systems diverge from human perception when dealing with unrestricted adversarial examples, emphasizing the need for SCOOTER as a standardized benchmark for further research.

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

### [148] [Where are we with calibration under dataset shift in image classification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07780)
*Mélanie Roschewitz,Raghav Mehta,Fabio de Sousa Ribeiro,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies calibration robustness in image classification under dataset shift and examines methods like post-hoc and in-training strategies across various tasks and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand how calibration techniques perform under real-world dataset shifts, given their importance in maintaining model performance across diverse scenarios.

Method: The authors compare calibration strategies including entropy regularization, label smoothing, post-hoc calibrators, and ensemble methods, assessing their effectiveness across eight image classification tasks with varying levels of shift.

Result: Key findings include: label smoothing combined with entropy regularization yields the best raw probabilities; post-hoc calibration with OOD data is robust; ensembles offer significant calibration benefits; and fine-tuned foundation models exhibit better calibration than scratch-trained models.

Conclusion: Improving calibration in shifted datasets may impact in-distribution calibration negatively. Ensembles and foundation model fine-tuning offer optimal results for calibration under dataset shifts.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

*Kang Cen,Chang-Hong Fu,Hong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an advanced end-to-end remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) network to extract accurate heart rate signals from facial videos using cutting-edge methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rPPG models struggle with accuracy, robustness, and generalization in complex conditions; hence, a more reliable and precise method is needed.

Method: The proposed method includes a 3D CNN for signal extraction, a differential frame fusion module for capturing blood volume pulse variations, Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms for enhancing rPPG features, and a dynamic hybrid loss function to reduce overfitting.

Result: The proposed model was tested on PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, showcasing strong performance even in challenging scenarios, with a significant improvement: a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set.

Conclusion: The proposed network demonstrates high robustness, accuracy, and generalization capabilities, representing an advancement over current state-of-the-art rPPG methods.

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

*Xi Xiao,Yunbei Zhang,Xingjian Li,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yuxiang Wei,Jihun Hamm,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT) balances dataset-level and instance-level prompts to address performance variance in downstream datasets, outperforming prior benchmarks in Vision Transformer fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the performance of Visual Prompt Tuning methods, which struggle with high input variance in downstream datasets due to static dataset-level prompts.

Method: ViaPT generates dynamic instance-aware prompts customized for individual inputs and blends them with dataset-level prompts, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract significant prompt information effectively.

Result: ViaPT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in Vision Transformer fine-tuning across 34 diverse datasets.

Conclusion: ViaPT provides a more efficient and balanced approach to tuning vision transformers, achieving better instance-specific adaptation and reducing learnable parameters compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

*Zhihui Zhang,Luanyuan Dai,Qika Lin,Yunfeng Diao,Guangyin Jin,Yufei Guo,Jing Zhang,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synergistic Prompting (SyP) for visual recognition under missing modality conditions, addressing limitations of previous strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant performance degradation in multi-modal visual recognition tasks caused by missing or incomplete modality inputs.

Method: Proposed Synergistic Prompting (SyP), a framework featuring (1) a Dynamic Adapter for adaptive scaling and generation of prompts, and (2) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy that hybridizes static and dynamic prompts for robust cross-modal reasoning.

Result: SyP outperforms existing methods in visual recognition across three datasets, demonstrating robust performance under varied missing modality rates and conditions.

Conclusion: SyP provides a flexible and reliable solution for handling missing modalities in multi-modal visual recognition, validated via experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

### [152] [Patient-specific vs Multi-Patient Vision Transformer for Markerless Tumor Motion Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07811)
*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces Vision Transformers (ViT) for forecasting lung tumor motion without markers, experimenting with patient-specific (PS) and multi-patient (MP) training strategies to enhance treatment precision in proton therapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current markerless lung tumor motion forecasting methods lack exploration of transformer-based architectures, despite their effectiveness in trajectory predictions.

Method: Two forecasting strategies—PS (trained on individual patient data) and MP (trained on multi-patient data)—were evaluated using DRRs derived from planning 4DCT scans of 31 patients, focusing on predicting tumor motion over 1-second horizons.

Result: PS models excelled in precision during planning (T1) data testing but required more data. MP models exhibited robustness to variability and performed well on treatment (T2) data without retraining.

Conclusion: ViT-based models enhance tumor motion prediction; PS models are precise but data-intensive, whereas MP models are robust and suitable for time-limited clinical applications.

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of current content-based puzzle solvers, introducing real-world challenges like missing pieces and eroded edges or contents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating puzzle solvers under realistic conditions crucial for real-world applications, such as reconstructing fragmented artefacts.

Method: Introduced three types of puzzle corruptions and evaluated heuristic and deep learning-based solvers for their robustness, focusing on the Positional Diffusion model.

Result: The performance of solvers significantly drops with increased corruption, but deep learning models can improve their robustness through data augmentation. Positional Diffusion outperformed competitors.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based approaches show promise for real-world applications, and future research should address robustness through improved models and training techniques.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimCIS, a new baseline for continual image segmentation (CIS) that addresses issues in existing methods, showing superior performance across tasks and settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve challenges in class-incremental image segmentation, particularly loss of plasticity and sensitivity to input data order in decoupled frameworks.

Method: The method involves leveraging feature alignment for query assignment, integrating cross-stage consistency and visual-query-based replay to maintain objectness and combat catastrophic forgetting.

Result: SimCIS outperforms state-of-the-art CIS methods in segmentation tasks, with improvements across different settings, splits, and input data orders.

Conclusion: SimCIS offers an effective and simple solution for CIS, encouraging plasticity while preserving objectness, and overcoming limitations of earlier approaches.

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-ADAM, a comprehensive 3D anomaly detection dataset designed to address shortcomings of current datasets in real-world industrial settings, aiming to boost defect detection accuracy in manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface defects impact manufacturing yield, and current defect detection methods are limited due to the lack of realistic and high-quality datasets representing industry conditions.

Method: The authors created 3D-ADAM, a large dataset with 14,120 high-resolution 3D scans and 27,346 annotated defects across 12 categories, collected under real-world industrial conditions.

Result: The dataset presents significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, showcasing its rigor and potential impact on pushing innovation in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM serves as a pivotal benchmark to drive advancements in robust 3D anomaly detection models suitable for practical manufacturing applications.

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: THUNDER provides a benchmark for comparing digital pathology foundation models on tile-level images using diverse datasets, tasks, and robustness analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of assessing progress in digital pathology due to the rapid emergence of foundation models, ensuring reliable and comparative insights.

Method: The method involves benchmarking 23 foundation models across 16 datasets with various tasks, focusing on downstream performance, feature analysis, robustness, and uncertainty.

Result: THUNDER demonstrates efficient comparison capabilities for state-of-the-art models and provides comprehensive insights into their performance and robustness.

Conclusion: THUNDER proves to be a valuable tool for standardized evaluation in digital pathology, emphasizing reliability and robustness analysis.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Result: SLURPP achieves state-of-the-art performance, being over 200x faster and providing ~3 dB PSNR improvement on synthetic benchmarks, with qualitative improvements on real-world data.

Conclusion: By leveraging strong priors on geometry and depth alongside an innovative data pipeline, SLURPP significantly advances underwater image restoration in speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

*Jinhong Wang,Tajamul Ashraf,Zongyan Han,Jorma Laaksonen,Rao Mohammad Anwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MIRA framework to enhance the factual accuracy of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in medical diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often generate factually inconsistent responses despite their potential in AI-assisted medical diagnosis, and existing solutions like RAG have notable limitations.

Method: The MIRA framework integrates two components: a Rethinking and Rearrangement module for retrieval calibration, and a medical RAG framework combining image embeddings, a medical knowledge base, and a query-rewrite module.

Result: MIRA significantly improves factual accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results on medical VQA and report generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: MIRA optimizes the integration of inherent model knowledge with external references, successfully improving factual accuracy and performance in multimodal medical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an FPGA-based unsupervised architecture for high-quality feature point detection in Visual SLAM using a quantised SuperPoint neural network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the need for efficient feature extraction methods for Visual SLAM in autonomous systems with limited computational resources.

Method: The authors developed a quantised SuperPoint CNN and implemented it on an AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA system using Brevitas and FINN frameworks.

Result: The system achieved up to 54 fps for 640x480 pixel images and outperformed state-of-the-art solutions on performance and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed model ensures high-quality feature detection while maintaining low computational demands, making it well-suited for embedded and mobile platforms.

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework, called CiCi, that enhances remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) models for real-time deployment without source data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing rPPG methods in real-world applications, such as privacy concerns and adaptability in unseen environments.

Method: An expert knowledge-based self-supervised framework named CiCi, integrating spatio-temporal consistency and inconsistency priors, with gradient dynamic control to ensure stable adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets show CiCi outperforms existing techniques under the TTA protocol, achieving real-time self-supervised adaptation.

Conclusion: The CiCi framework provides a privacy-respecting, efficient solution for deploying rPPG models in real-world scenarios while maintaining top-tier performance.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

TL;DR: The paper presents a real-time identification algorithm for mice in home cages, integrating behavioral and physiological monitoring for improved data collection and animal welfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by challenges in individual mouse monitoring in laboratory settings due to housing density, similar appearances, mobility, and interactions.

Method: The approach includes a multi-part pipeline: MouseTracks (a custom tracking system), Mouseformer (a transformer-based ID classifier), and MouseMap (a tracklet associator program), using cameras and custom ear tags for mouse identification.

Result: The pipeline achieves 30 frames-per-second ID processing with improved efficiency and reduced ID errors under different conditions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This system enhances the accuracy and reliability of mouse monitoring, offering more precise and continuous data collection for disease studies and other research.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a solution for generating realistic Martian landscape videos for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation using a data pipeline and a video generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Martian video synthesis faces challenges due to limited Martian data and the disparity between Martian and Earth imagery.

Method: The researchers introduced M3arsSynth to reconstruct 3D Martian landscapes and MarsGen to generate realistic videos via fine-tuning and conditioning techniques.

Result: The proposed method generates high-quality videos that outperform terrestrial-trained models in realism and 3D consistency.

Conclusion: The solution addresses data scarcity and domain gaps, providing a robust tool for accurate Martian video synthesis aiding various applications.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

*Haoyu Wu,Diankun Wu,Tianyu He,Junliang Guo,Yang Ye,Yueqi Duan,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Geometry Forcing, a method to improve video diffusion models' ability to internalize latent 3D representations by aligning intermediate representations with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models trained only on raw video data struggle to capture meaningful 3D geometric structures inherent in videos, limiting their effectiveness in 3D-aware applications.

Method: The method, Geometry Forcing, encourages 3D-awareness in video diffusion models using two alignment objectives: Angular Alignment for directional consistency and Scale Alignment for scale retention, aligning the intermediate representations with pretrained geometric foundation model features.

Result: Geometry Forcing improves the visual quality and 3D consistency of video diffusion models in tasks like camera-view conditioned and action-conditioned video generation when compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing effectively bridges the gap between video diffusion models and the 3D nature of videos, enabling these models to capture and utilize meaningful geometric-aware structures for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OST-Bench is a newly developed benchmark to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) engaging in active scene exploration, testing dynamic reasoning and memory integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs are typically evaluated with static benchmarks that don't address challenges of real-world embodied perception, especially online spatio-temporal reasoning during active scene exploration.

Method: OST-Bench assesses MLLMs by tracking their ability to reason over incrementally acquired observations and integrate current inputs with memory across 1.4k scenes and 10k Q&A pairs sourced from major datasets.

Result: Leading MLLMs showed significant performance drops on tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning and longer memory retrieval in the online setting with extended exploration horizons.

Conclusion: OST-Bench highlights critical shortcomings of current MLLMs in online embodied reasoning and provides resources to drive progress in improving spatio-temporal and memory-intensive capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

### [166] [CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985)
*Bijay Gurung,David T. Hoffmann,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals that the binding issue in CLIP models, where they fail to distinguish image object associations accurately, is linked to data issues like saliency bias and incomplete captions. Improved data properties overcome this problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models demonstrate limitations in image-text association, failing to understand nuanced object relationships within images, which undermines their broader usability.

Method: The study uses a synthetic dataset to analyze the influence of data properties on CLIP's performance, focusing on aspects such as attribute density and caption completeness.

Result: Key data characteristics like attribute density and specificity were found to be critical for CLIP to achieve accurate binding performance.

Conclusion: Only datasets addressing these vital properties allow CLIP to reliably learn object relationships, overturning beliefs about the sufficiency of scaling batch sizes or hard negatives.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Spatio-Temporal Token Merging (STTM), which reduces video large language model (LLM) computing demands by merging spatio-temporal tokens in a training-free process, achieving faster speeds with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the computational cost and inefficiency in video LLMs caused by quadratic scaling with the number of spatio-temporal tokens.

Method: The paper proposes a training-free token reduction method, STTM, which utilizes spatio-temporal redundancies, quadtree-based spatial token merging, and temporal pairwise merging.

Result: STTM achieves significant speed-ups (2x under 50% token budget with 0.5% accuracy loss; 3x under 30% budget with 2% accuracy loss) across six video QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: STTM effectively balances speed and performance efficiency, making it a practical solution for video LLMs, and its query-agnostic design allows reuse of computations for multiple queries on the same video.

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keypoint detection struggles in few-shot learning when query data lacks source data from the same distribution. Utilizing sketch-based human expression data provides an alternative solution.

Method: The authors designed a prototypical setup, grid-based locator, and prototypical domain adaptation to address cross-modal embeddings and sketch-specific style variations.

Result: The framework achieves few-shot convergence across novel keypoints and classes, as shown in their detailed experimental validations.

Conclusion: The novel solution improves keypoint detection in few-shot learning scenarios using sketches and successfully tackles the distribution gap inherent in such contexts.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces KARL, a single-pass adaptive tokenizer for images, based on Kolmogorov Complexity principles. It predicts token count dynamically, aiming to optimize data compression and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between visual representation learning systems and Algorithmic Information Theory by introducing adaptive tokenization methods that are efficient, variable-length, and conceptually aligned with Kolmogorov Complexity.

Method: The paper presents KARL, a single-pass adaptive tokenizer that halts tokenization once an approximate Kolmogorov Complexity is reached. It learns to predict token halting based on desired quality using an approach similar to Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning.

Result: KARL achieves competitive performance to recent adaptive tokenizers but with the added efficiency of requiring only a single pass. The scaling laws and evaluations also align KARL's predictions of image complexity with human intuition.

Conclusion: KARL represents an advancement in adaptive tokenization, leveraging insights from Algorithmic Information Theory to offer efficient and intuitive image representation capabilities. The results underline its practical and theoretical potential.

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for improving the performance of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), achieving state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant performance gap between VQ-VAEs and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in image reconstruction tasks, particularly in preserving fidelity and minimizing information loss.

Method: The authors propose a new approach called \NickName, which retains the latent dimension, introduces sub-codebooks for improved quantization, and evaluates performance on high-resolution zero-shot benchmarks.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and eight zero-shot benchmarks, significantly outperforming competitors like SD-VAE, with improved metrics such as rFID and PSNR.

Conclusion: \NickName effectively improves the quality of VQ-VAEs in reconstructing high-resolution images, facilitating advancements in HD image processing with publicly available code for further exploration.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on

Method: The paper measures co-occurrence statistics using pointwise mutual information (PMI) and conducts experiments with synthetic and edited natural images.

Result: A strong correlation was found between PMI in the training data and the model's accuracy (r=0.97 for synthetic images and r=0.75 for natural images). This behavior also transfers to LMMs based on CLIP.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of developing methods and architectures to enhance compositional generalization without needing to scale training data combinatorially.

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

### [172] [Compute Can't Handle the Truth: Why Communication Tax Prioritizes Memory and Interconnects in Modern AI Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07223)
*Myoungsoo Jung*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses scalability challenges in AI workloads with a novel data center architecture integrating CXL and XLink technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the scaling limitations faced by traditional GPU-centric architectures in handling modern AI workloads such as large language models and RAG.

Method: The authors propose a modular data center architecture using Compute Express Link (CXL) for resource scaling and a hybrid CXL-over-XLink design to optimize memory coherence and data transfers.

Result: The proposed architecture enhances scalability, throughput, and flexibility for AI infrastructure.

Conclusion: Disaggregated and well-optimized data center designs, like the one proposed, are critical for efficient large-scale AI computation.

Abstract: Modern AI workloads such as large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) impose severe demands on memory,
communication bandwidth, and resource flexibility. Traditional GPU-centric
architectures struggle to scale due to growing inter-GPU communication
overheads. This report introduces key AI concepts and explains how Transformers
revolutionized data representation in LLMs. We analyze large-scale AI hardware
and data center designs, identifying scalability bottlenecks in hierarchical
systems. To address these, we propose a modular data center architecture based
on Compute Express Link (CXL) that enables disaggregated scaling of memory,
compute, and accelerators. We further explore accelerator-optimized
interconnects-collectively termed XLink (e.g., UALink, NVLink, NVLink
Fusion)-and introduce a hybrid CXL-over-XLink design to reduce long-distance
data transfers while preserving memory coherence. We also propose a
hierarchical memory model that combines local and pooled memory, and evaluate
lightweight CXL implementations, HBM, and silicon photonics for efficient
scaling. Our evaluations demonstrate improved scalability, throughput, and
flexibility in AI infrastructure.

### [173] [Distributed Training under Packet Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07114)
*Erez Weintraub,Ron Banner,Ariel Orda*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new distributed training framework robust to unreliable connections, maintaining model accuracy despite packet loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern large-model training often faces scalability limitations due to reliance on reliable connections in distributed systems.

Method: A two-stage defense mechanism: (i) Unbiased gradient aggregation at the worker level, and (ii) Bounded parameter drift to prevent model divergence.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that even with 10% random packet loss, the framework ensures minimal accuracy impact (0.8% perplexity change on LLAMA2 7B with 64 GPUs).

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable and efficient large-model training over commodity or wide-area networks, bridging accuracy demands with communication efficiency.

Abstract: State-of-the-art language and vision models are routinely trained across
thousands of GPUs, often spanning multiple data-centers, yet today's
distributed frameworks still assume reliable connections (e.g., InfiniBand or
RoCE). The resulting acknowledgment traffic and retransmissions inflate tail
latencies and limit scalability. Leveraging unreliable connections will reduce
latency but may sacrifice model accuracy and convergence once packets are
dropped. A principled, end-to-end solution that preserves accuracy and
convergence guarantees under genuine packet loss has previously been missing.
We address this critical gap by introducing a novel distributed training
framework capable of operating over unreliable connections, offering unbiased
gradient aggregation and bounded parameter drift without modifying model code
or optimizers. The key insight is a two-stage defense against missing messages:
(i) Unbiased gradient aggregation: each worker reconstructs a consistent
gradient estimate from whatever packets arrive, guaranteeing expectation-level
correctness; and (ii) Bounded-drift parameter broadcasts: we prove the
inter-worker model discrepancy remains O(1) even after arbitrarily many
iterations, preventing the unbounded divergence typical of asynchronous setups.
Analytical bounds are matched by experiments on the LLAMA2 7B model with 64
GPUs: tolerating 10% random packet loss yields at most 0.8% perplexity change.
This work bridges the gap between communication-efficient datacenter protocols
and the accuracy and generalization guarantees demanded by modern large-model
training, enabling robust, high-throughput learning on commodity or wide-area
networks.

*Juan Cano-Benito,Andrea Cimmino,Sven Hertling,Heiko Paulheim,Raúl García-Castro*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates semantic data storage on various distributed ledger technologies (DLT) using a knowledge graph, finding private DLTs efficient and hybrid DLTs providing balanced trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in efficiently storing semantic data in decentralized data spaces using DLTs.

Method: Performed a systematic evaluation of semantic data storage on public, private, and hybrid DLTs using a real-world knowledge graph.

Result: Private DLTs demonstrated high efficiency, while hybrid DLTs balanced auditability and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings facilitate informed decisions on DLT infrastructure selection for decentralized data ecosystems based on data sovereignty needs.

Abstract: Data spaces are emerging as decentralised infrastructures that enable
sovereign, secure, and trustworthy data exchange among multiple participants.
To achieve semantic interoperability within these environments, the use of
semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs has been proposed. Although
distributed ledger technologies (DLT) fit as the underlying infrastructure for
data spaces, there remains a significant gap in terms of the efficient storage
of semantic data on these platforms. This paper presents a systematic
evaluation of semantic data storage across different types of DLT (public,
private, and hybrid), using a real-world knowledge graph as an experimental
basis. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource
consumption, and the capabilities to update and query semantic data. The
results show that private DLTs are the most efficient for storing and managing
semantic content, while hybrid DLTs offer a balanced trade-off between public
auditability and operational efficiency. This research leads to a discussion on
the selection of the most appropriate DLT infrastructure based on the data
sovereignty requirements of decentralised data ecosystems.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study analyzes network communication patterns in distributed machine learning jobs to streamline resource provisioning, focusing on collective communication operations' behaviors and anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the communication bottlenecks in distributed machine learning tasks that stem from operations like AllReduce and Broadcast, which can lead to network congestion and performance degradation.

Method: An analysis was conducted using Nvidia's logging functionalities for collective communication, adjusting parameters such as parallelism, node count, and model type.

Result: The findings depict diverse behaviors in communication operations across various models, emphasizing anomalies and inefficiencies in current frameworks and topologies.

Conclusion: The study recommends reconsidering existing communication frameworks and network architectures to better accommodate workloads and mitigate network-related issues in distributed ML systems.

Abstract: Machine Learning jobs, carried out on large number of distributed high
performance systems, involve periodic communication using operations like
AllReduce, AllGather, and Broadcast. These operations may create high bandwidth
and bursty traffic patterns, leading to network congestion and packet loss,
thus impacting the performance of these jobs. Hence it is imperative to analyze
these patterns, which can be helpful in provisioning network resources
depending on the type of machine learning workloads. In this poster we carry
out extensive analysis of the collective communication behavior seen in a wide
variety of models (ex. DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, etc.) To achieve this we
instrument Nvidia Collective Communication Library logging functionality for
richer context about the collectives and workloads. We adjust configuration
parameters that influence collective communication behavior, such as
parallelism, number of nodes, and model type. This overview presents and
discusses some of the results on the collective communication behavior for the
open source DeepSeek V3 inferencing model, which includes operation type and
count, transfer sizes per operation, and request size distribution. Our
analysis shows that it makes sense to rethink current collective communication
frameworks and network topologies so as to accommodate the effect of network
anomalies on the mentioned workloads.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Helix Parallelism, a hybrid method that improves efficiency in real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence LLMs within tight latency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address bottlenecks in real-time autoregressive decoding faced by LLMs with large KV histories, specifically in handling FFN weights and long KV caches under strict latency limits.

Method: Helix Parallelism combines KV parallelism during attention with Tensor Parallelism or Expert Parallelism during FFN computation, supplemented by lightweight communication steps through Helix HOP-B to reduce communication overhead.

Result: Helix reduces token-to-token latency by up to 1.5x at fixed batch sizes and enables batch sizes up to 32x larger within the same latency budget.

Conclusion: Helix improves GPU efficiency, enabling practical real-time inference in LLMs with ultra-long sequences, and advances the throughput-latency tradeoff.

Abstract: As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive
decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing
pressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
weights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps
mitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.
When TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV
duplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,
DRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further
capping efficiency.
  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV
parallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the
same GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN
computation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight
communication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce
Helix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through
batchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared
to conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at
fixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency
budget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on
Blackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.

### [177] [Ampere: Communication-Efficient and High-Accuracy Split Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07130)
*Zihan Zhang,Leon Wong,Blesson Varghese*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes Ampere, a system that enhances the efficiency and accuracy of Federated Learning by reducing device computation, communication overheads, and handling data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Split Federated Learning, namely high communication overheads, reduced accuracy with non-IID data, and significant on-device computation demands.

Method: Ampere introduces unidirectional inter-block training and uses a lightweight auxiliary network to decouple training between devices and servers, reducing gradient transfers and minimizing communication exchanges.

Result: Ampere achieves up to a 13.26% improvement in model accuracy, 94.6% reduction in training time, 99.1% reduction in communication overhead, and 93.13% reduction in device computation compared to baseline systems, alongside better accuracy consistency with non-IID data.

Conclusion: Ampere significantly enhances Federated Learning systems by optimizing communication, computation, training efficiency, and accuracy under data heterogeneity challenges.

Abstract: A Federated Learning (FL) system collaboratively trains neural networks
across devices and a server but is limited by significant on-device computation
costs. Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a
block of layers of the network from the device to a server. However, in doing
so, it introduces large communication overheads due to frequent exchanges of
intermediate activations and gradients between devices and the server and
reduces model accuracy for non-IID data. We propose Ampere, a novel
collaborative training system that simultaneously minimizes on-device
computation and device-server communication while improving model accuracy.
Unlike SFL, which uses a global loss by iterative end-to-end training, Ampere
develops unidirectional inter-block training to sequentially train the device
and server block with a local loss, eliminating the transfer of gradients. A
lightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the
device and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single
transfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere
mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations
generated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to
SFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations. Extensive
experiments on multiple CNNs and transformers show that, compared to
state-of-the-art SFL baseline systems, Ampere (i) improves model accuracy by up
to 13.26% while reducing training time by up to 94.6%, (ii) reduces
device-server communication overhead by up to 99.1% and on-device computation
by up to 93.13%, and (iii) reduces standard deviation of accuracy by 53.39% for
various non-IID degrees highlighting superior performance when faced with
heterogeneous data.

*Hongyi Xie,Min Zhou,Qiao Yu,Jialiang Yu,Zhenli Sheng,Hong Xie,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces M$^2$-MFP, a new framework to predict hardware memory failures in cloud infrastructure with higher accuracy by leveraging multi-level binary matrix representations, automatic feature extraction, and dual-path temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory failures negatively impact the reliability of cloud IT services, necessitating accurate prediction methods to ensure stable performance.

Method: The paper proposes M$^2$-MFP, which converts memory error logs (correctable errors) into binary matrices, applies the Binary Spatial Feature Extractor for automated feature extraction, and employs dual-path temporal modeling for high-order feature aggregation and rule creation.

Result: M$^2$-MFP significantly outperforms existing models in reliability and prediction accuracy as validated by experiments conducted on benchmark datasets and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The M$^2$-MFP approach improves cloud infrastructure reliability by addressing key limitations of previous prediction frameworks, offering robust results across various datasets.

Abstract: As cloud services become increasingly integral to modern IT infrastructure,
ensuring hardware reliability is essential to sustain high-quality service.
Memory failures pose a significant threat to overall system stability, making
accurate failure prediction through the analysis of memory error logs (i.e.,
Correctable Errors) imperative. Existing memory failure prediction approaches
have notable limitations: rule-based expert models suffer from limited
generalizability and low recall rates, while automated feature extraction
methods exhibit suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we
propose M$^2$-MFP: a Multi-scale and hierarchical memory failure prediction
framework designed to enhance the reliability and availability of cloud
infrastructure. M$^2$-MFP converts Correctable Errors (CEs) into multi-level
binary matrix representations and introduces a Binary Spatial Feature Extractor
(BSFE) to automatically extract high-order features at both DIMM-level and
bit-level. Building upon the BSFE outputs, we develop a dual-path temporal
modeling architecture: 1) a time-patch module that aggregates multi-level
features within observation windows, and 2) a time-point module that employs
interpretable rule-generation trees trained on bit-level patterns. Experiments
on both benchmark datasets and real-world deployment show the superiority of
M$^2$-MFP as it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by significant
margins. Code and data are available at this repository:

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents a multiscale workflow management system, MuMMI, and its simplified version, mini-MuMMI, for orchestrating thousands of machine-learning-driven molecular simulations, particularly for studying biomolecular interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address the challenges of modeling complex phenomena involving interactions across vastly different time and length scales, which require multiscale models that are computationally demanding and hard to manage effectively.

Method: The authors propose MuMMI, a massively parallel workflow management infrastructure for multiscale models, and introduce mini-MuMMI as a lightweight version capable of running on modest HPC systems or even laptops. The system schedules and controls simulations at different scales.

Result: The utility of mini-MuMMI was demonstrated through the study of RAS-RAF membrane interactions. Additionally, the framework's adaptability to other use cases outside of molecular dynamics was discussed.

Conclusion: Mini-MuMMI broadens accessibility by enabling multiscale workflow management on less powerful systems while addressing the challenges of multiscale modeling and promoting potential applications beyond molecular dynamics.

Abstract: Computational models have become one of the prevalent methods to model
complex phenomena. To accurately model complex interactions, such as detailed
biomolecular interactions, scientists often rely on multiscale models comprised
of several internal models operating at difference scales, ranging from
microscopic to macroscopic length and time scales. Bridging the gap between
different time and length scales has historically been challenging but the
advent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling
that task. Multiscale models require massive amounts of computational power and
a powerful workflow management system. Orchestrating ML-driven multiscale
studies on parallel systems with thousands of nodes is challenging, the
workflow must schedule, allocate and control thousands of simulations operating
at different scales. Here, we discuss the massively parallel Multiscale
Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), a multiscale workflow
management infrastructure, that can orchestrate thousands of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations operating at different timescales, spanning from millisecond
to nanosecond. More specifically, we introduce a novel version of MuMMI called
"mini-MuMMI". Mini-MuMMI is a curated version of MuMMI designed to run on
modest HPC systems or even laptops whereas MuMMI requires larger HPC systems.
We demonstrate mini-MuMMI utility by exploring RAS-RAF membrane interactions
and discuss the different challenges behind the generalization of multiscale
workflows and how mini-MuMMI can be leveraged to target a broader range of
applications outside of MD and RAS-RAF interactions.

*Zaifeng Pan,Ajjkumar Patel,Zhengding Hu,Yipeng Shen,Yue Guan,Wan-Lu Li,Lianhui Qin,Yida Wang,Yufei Ding*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: KVFlow introduces a tailored cache management framework that predicts agent usage and proactively manages tensor loading for large language model workflows, significantly improving execution efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM systems suffer from inefficiencies caused by redundant computations and cache evictions that fail to anticipate future agent usage in workflows.

Method: KVFlow uses an Agent Step Graph to predict agent activation proximity, implements a fine-grained cache eviction strategy, and adds overlapped tensor prefetching for seamless agent execution.

Result: KVFlow demonstrates speedups of up to 1.83x in single workflows with large prompts and up to 2.19x in concurrent workflow scenarios, compared to existing hierarchical radix cache systems.

Conclusion: KVFlow effectively optimizes cache usage and prefetching in LLM workflows, minimizing overhead and improving system efficiency in agentic tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agentic workflows have become a popular
paradigm for coordinating multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks.
To improve serving efficiency, existing LLM systems employ prefix caching to
reuse key-value (KV) tensors corresponding to agents' fixed prompts, thereby
avoiding redundant computation across repeated invocations. However, current
systems typically evict KV caches using a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy,
which fails to anticipate future agent usage and often discards KV caches
shortly before their reuse. This leads to frequent cache misses and substantial
recomputation or swapping overhead. We present KVFlow, a workflow-aware KV
cache management framework tailored for agentic workloads. KVFlow abstracts the
agent execution schedule as an Agent Step Graph and assigns each agent a
steps-to-execution value that estimates its temporal proximity to future
activation. These values guide a fine-grained eviction policy at the KV node
level, allowing KVFlow to preserve entries likely to be reused and efficiently
manage shared prefixes in tree-structured caches. Moreover, KVFlow introduces a
fully overlapped KV prefetching mechanism, which proactively loads required
tensors from CPU to GPU in background threads for agents scheduled in the next
step, thereby avoiding cache miss stalls during generation. Compared to SGLang
with hierarchical radix cache, KVFlow achieves up to 1.83$\times$ speedup for
single workflows with large prompts, and up to 2.19$\times$ speedup for
scenarios with many concurrent workflows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARLISE, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based approach that improves edge-cloud resource scaling using dynamic and adaptive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional edge-cloud resource scaling relies on static methods that are inefficient in handling dynamic and unpredictable workloads.

Method: MARLISE utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, specifically Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), for adaptive in-place scaling.

Result: MARLISE ensures low response times for microservices, improves scalability, and outperforms heuristic methods in resource elasticity and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed MARLISE approach effectively optimizes resource scaling, achieving improved microservice performance and better resource utilization in edge-cloud systems.

Abstract: Modern edge-cloud systems face challenges in efficiently scaling resources to
handle dynamic and unpredictable workloads. Traditional scaling approaches
typically rely on static thresholds and predefined rules, which are often
inadequate for optimizing resource utilization and maintaining performance in
distributed and dynamic environments. This inefficiency hinders the
adaptability and performance required in edge-cloud infrastructures, which can
only be achieved through the newly proposed in-place scaling. To address this
problem, we propose the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based In-place
Scaling Engine (MARLISE) that enables seamless, dynamic, reactive control with
in-place resource scaling. We develop our solution using two Deep Reinforcement
Learning algorithms: Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). We analyze each version of the proposed MARLISE solution using dynamic
workloads, demonstrating their ability to ensure low response times of
microservices and scalability. Our results show that MARLISE-based approaches
outperform heuristic method in managing resource elasticity while maintaining
microservice response times and achieving higher resource efficiency.

Motivation: Address challenges of existing GPU autoscaling mechanisms in Kubernetes, especially under dynamic and bursty traffic patterns.

Method: Developed KIS-S framework including KISim, a GPU-aware simulation tool, and KIScaler, a PPO-based autoscaler trained in simulation.

Result: KIScaler improves average reward by 75.2%, achieves up to 6.7x reduction in P95 latency over CPU baselines, and generalizes without retraining.

Conclusion: KIS-S effectively bridges the gap between reactive autoscaling and advanced orchestration for GPU workloads in Kubernetes.

Abstract: Autoscaling GPU inference workloads in Kubernetes remains challenging due to
the reactive and threshold-based nature of default mechanisms such as the
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which struggle under dynamic and bursty
traffic patterns and lack integration with GPU-level metrics. We present KIS-S,
a unified framework that combines KISim, a GPU-aware Kubernetes Inference
Simulator, with KIScaler, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based
autoscaler. KIScaler learns latency-aware and resource-efficient scaling
policies entirely in simulation, and is directly deployed without retraining.
Experiments across four traffic patterns show that KIScaler improves average
reward by 75.2%, reduces P95 latency up to 6.7x over CPU baselines, and
generalizes without retraining. Our work bridges the gap between reactive
autoscaling and intelligent orchestration for scalable GPU-accelerated
environments.

### [183] [Scale leads to compositional generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07207)
*Florian Redhardt,Yassir Akram,Simon Schug*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks can achieve compositional generalization by scaling data and model size, and the ability to decode task components linearly from hidden layers correlates with performance on specific tasks like text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores whether neural networks, which are continuous and distributed, can handle tasks with discrete and compositional structures, aiming to clarify the conditions under which they succeed or fail.

Method: The authors scaled model size and dataset coverage, examined task encodings, and proved theoretical capabilities of multilayer perceptrons for compositional tasks while analyzing hidden layer activations.

Result: Scaling data and model size enabled compositional generalization across encodings, and multilayer perceptrons were shown to approximate compositional tasks precisely with a linear number of neurons.

Conclusion: Networks exhibit compositional generalization when trained on sufficiently representative data, and this is linked to their ability to linearly decode task components from hidden activations; failures in such generalization impact tasks like text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational bottleneck of attention mechanisms in LLM and VLM training due to high memory and time complexity, and the lack of rigorous evaluation of energy and resource demands.

Method: Benchmarking eight attention mechanisms in GPT-2 architecture for metrics like training time, GPU memory usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption.

Result: Optimized kernel implementations like Flash Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) showed superior energy efficiency.

Conclusion: Energy-aware benchmarking is critical to optimizing attention mechanisms, and factors like training time, beyond GPU power, should be carefully considered. Codes are shared publicly for further exploration.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for scaling LLMs are resource-heavy and inflexible, necessitating better solutions for efficient model development.

Method: Proposes fixed embeddings as "docking ports" for two paradigms: merging specialist models into a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model and layer-wise progression of Transformer growth.

Result: Demonstrates performance improvement in merged MoE models and stable evolution of reasoning abilities with incremental model depth.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a shift toward incremental and modular AI training methods, promoting efficient scaling, continual learning, and democratized AI development.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

### [186] [FACap: A Large-scale Fashion Dataset for Fine-grained Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07135)
*François Gardères,Shizhe Chen,Camille-Sovanneary Gauthier,Jean Ponce*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FACap, a large-scale fashion-domain dataset for composed image retrieval (CIR), and proposes FashionBLIP-2, a model fine-tuned on this dataset to improve retrieval performance for fine-grained modifications in fashion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current composed image retrieval methods perform well for general concepts but struggle in fashion domains due to the need for fine-grained visual and language understanding and the lack of annotated datasets.

Method: The authors created FACap, a dataset using web-sourced images and a two-stage annotation process involving VLMs and LLMs. They also introduced FashionBLIP-2, which fine-tunes the BLIP-2 model with lightweight adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like Fashion IQ and enhFashionIQ show that Fine-tuning FashionBLIP-2 on FACap significantly enhances the model's performance in fashion CIR, especially for fine-grained text modifications.

Conclusion: The introduction of FACap and FashionBLIP-2 demonstrates an effective approach for tackling challenges in fashion-domain CIR, offering solutions for demanding applications such as e-commerce platforms.

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

### [187] [Automating Evaluation of Diffusion Model Unlearning with (Vision-) Language Model World Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07137)
*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Henry Kvinge,Timothy Doster,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces autoeval-dmun, an automated tool for assessing concept unlearning in diffusion models to address challenges in effectiveness and unintended damages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in verifying the efficacy of machine unlearning (MU) in diffusion models and to prevent damaging surrounding concepts during the unlearning process.

Method: The approach involves leveraging (vision-) language models to evaluate unlearning by extracting structured world knowledge, identifying potentially damaged concepts, and utilizing adversarial prompts to assess and circumvent unlearning.

Result: Autoeval-dmun revealed that language models can impose semantic orderings of nearby concepts that align with unlearning damage and can effectively bypass unlearning with adversarial prompts.

Conclusion: The study offers an effective tool for evaluating unlearning in diffusion models, demonstrating the potential of language models to address unlearning challenges.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

### [188] [GNNs Meet Sequence Models Along the Shortest-Path: an Expressive Method for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07138)
*Francesco Ferrini,Veronica Lachi,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP is a framework combining GNN representations and sequence modeling of shortest paths for structured and efficient link prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with link prediction due to their node-centric nature, missing crucial subgraph structures connecting node pairs.

Method: SP4LP involves using GNNs for node embeddings, extracting shortest paths for node pairs, and applying sequence models to these paths for relational pattern modeling.

Result: SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on link prediction benchmarks and is demonstrated to be more expressive than existing methods.

Conclusion: SP4LP effectively captures multi-hop and structural dependencies in a computationally efficient manner, establishing it as a significant advancement for link prediction in graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

*Samin Yeasar Arnob,Zhan Su,Minseon Kim,Oleksiy Ostapenko,Riyasat Ohib,Esra'a Saleh,Doina Precup,Lucas Caccia,Alessandro Sordoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies sparse adapters as building blocks for parameter-efficient modular architectures, showing they outperform existing methods like LoRA in certain settings and demonstrate superior merging properties for multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted to specific tasks without additional fine-tuning, aiming to improve efficiency and scalability compared to existing methods (e.g., LoRA).

Method: The paper introduces a simpler method to train sparse adapters by training only a subset of weights in the base neural network and compares their effectiveness with LoRA and full fine-tuning. It also evaluates their performance when merged across up to 20 NLP tasks.

Result: Sparse adapters outperform LoRA and full fine-tuning in in-distribution performance post-merging and scale well when applied to a large number of NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Sparse adapters are effective and scalable building blocks for modular architectures, exhibiting superior performance in merging tasks than current methods. However, achieving strong performance on held-out data remains a limitation for all approaches reviewed.

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

*Dongxiao He,Yongqi Huang,Jitao Zhao,Xiaobao Wang,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Str-GCL, a framework that integrates structural commonsense into Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) using first-order logic rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods overlook the structural commonsense embedded in graph structure and attributes, which is essential for effective representation learning.

Method: The proposed Str-GCL framework employs first-order logic rules to encode structural commonsense, introducing topological and attribute-based rules without changing the original graph. It utilizes a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in capturing this commonsense.

Result: Str-GCL demonstrates superior performance compared to existing GCL methods through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural commonsense into GCL opens new possibilities for graph representation learning, as evidenced by Str-GCL's success.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three modeling approaches (ODEs, UDEs, Neural ODEs) for malware propagation and finds that UDEs outperform others, reducing prediction error by 44%, while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately modeling malware propagation is crucial for designing effective cybersecurity defenses, especially against adaptive threats.

Method: The authors use scientific machine learning with ODEs, UDEs, and Neural ODEs, and compare them using data from the Code Red worm outbreak. They also introduce symbolic recovery to interpret learned neural feedback.

Result: UDEs significantly reduced prediction errors and uncovered suppression mechanisms such as network saturation and security responses, outperforming traditional and neural methods.

Conclusion: Hybrid physics-informed models like UDEs combine predictive accuracy with interpretability, offering better tools for malware modeling, outbreak response, and cyber defense strategies.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

### [192] [TRIP: A Nonparametric Test to Diagnose Biased Feature Importance Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07276)
*Aaron Foote,Danny Krizanc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation), which aims to detect misleading permutation feature importance scores in machine learning models, especially when dependent features are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding feature importance in predictions is essential for machine learning models, but commonly used methods like permutation feature importance can be unreliable with dependent features.

Method: The authors propose TRIP, a test based on minimal assumptions, capable of detecting unreliable permutation feature importance scores resulting from model extrapolation. They further adapt it for applicability in high-dimensional settings.

Result: Tests on simulated data and real-world applications validate that TRIP can reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are unreliable, addressing issues caused by dependent features.

Conclusion: TRIP enhances the reliability of permutation feature importance analysis, providing a useful tool for detecting flawed interpretations and improving model transparency.

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

*Zhaojing Zhou,Xunchao Li,Minghao Li,Handi Zhang,Haoshuang Wang,Wenbin Chang,Yiqun Liu,Qingqing Dang,Dianhai Yu,Yanjun Ma,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), a novel method to compress Large Language Models (LLMs) to 2.0-2.75 bits while maintaining accuracy and improving inference performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the escalating inference costs and deployment barriers of LLMs, especially when using sub-3-bit quantization, which often leads to accuracy and efficiency loss.

Method: CCQ combines hardware-aware bit-shift encoding/decoding, Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code Cluster to optimize LLM quantization. It creates a linear mapping between codebooks and weight vectors for better inference efficiency while minimizing performance degradation.

Result: The experiments show CCQ significantly compresses LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3 to 184GB and ERNIE-4.5 to 89GB) while maintaining performance, allowing single-GPU deployment and eliminating inter-card communication.

Conclusion: CCQ effectively balances extreme compression (to 2-bits) with minimal accuracy loss, enhancing scalability and usability in resource-constrained environments, and has been open-sourced for wide adoption.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

*Zheyu Zhang,Jiayuan Dong,Jie Liu,Xun Huan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GO-CBED is a new Bayesian framework for sequential causal experimental design that targets specific causal queries, optimizing experiments efficiently through advanced algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often aim to identify the entire causal model, which is inefficient when researchers are only interested in specific causal aspects. This paper seeks a more targeted approach for experimental design.

Method: The framework maximizes expected information gain (EIG) for specific causal quantities of interest using a variational lower bound estimator. A transformer-based policy network and normalizing flow-based posterior are used, enabling real-time decision-making.

Result: GO-CBED surpassed current baselines in various experiments, showing its capability in settings with limited budgets and complex causal structures. It was evaluated on synthetic and semi-synthetic causal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GO-CBED offers a more efficient, goal-oriented method for sequential experimental design, underlining the importance of aligning experiments with specific research queries and planning ahead.

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces G-Guard, a GNN-based classifier to combat multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs by leveraging entity graphs and attention-aware mechanisms. It achieves superior performance across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the vulnerability of LLMs to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, which escalate over time and are harder to detect compared to single-turn attacks.

Method: The paper presents G-Guard, a graph neural network solution that constructs an entity graph to analyze multi-turn queries, and employs an attention-aware mechanism to enhance harmful query detection by using labeled nodes from similar single-turn queries.

Result: Evaluation shows that G-Guard significantly outperforms all baseline methods on multiple datasets and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: G-Guard is a promising advancement in safeguarding LLMs against sophisticated multi-turn jailbreak attacks, leveraging innovative graph-based techniques to improve classification accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul)," a new approach to enhance prompt learning in Vision Language Models (VLM) by removing reliance on textual descriptions derived from Large Language Models (LLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Language Models (VLM) can adapt to tasks using prompts, but extracting textual descriptions from Large Language Models (LLM) has limitations in variability and reliability. The need is to enhance robustness and semantics using a more effective method.

Method: DeMul eliminates description extraction and directly integrates knowledge from LLM into continuous vector-based prompts. It also introduces a multi-prompt weighting mechanism to emphasize the significance of different prompts during training.

Result: The proposed method was tested on 11 recognition datasets, outperforming existing approaches in terms of performance metrics.

Conclusion: Description-free methods like DeMul enhance the adaptability and reliability of Vision Language Models while simplifying the prompt-design process, making them more robust to unseen and diverse data.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces new mathematical inequalities for vector-valued processes in Hilbert spaces, focusing on non-independent and non-identically distributed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges arise in statistical learning due to data that is not independent and identically distributed (non-iid). Current tools are often insufficient for effectively managing such data.

Method: Develop data-dependent Bernstein inequalities, specifically tailored to vector-valued processes in Hilbert spaces, applicable to both stationary and non-stationary processes.

Result: The introduced inequalities improve covariance operator estimation in Hilbert-Schmidt norm and enhance operator learning in dynamical systems, supported by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The developed inequalities offer practical utility in statistical learning tasks when handling complex dependencies, demonstrated through novel risk bounds and numerical validations.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models face limitations in time series forecasting. CGFM improves performance by leveraging errors from auxiliary models and advanced path methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome constraints in generative models like diffusion models for time series forecasting where rigid source distributions and limited sampling paths restrict progress.

Method: Introducing Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM), which learns from auxiliary model errors, integrates historical data as conditions, and employs advanced conditional probability paths.

Result: CGFM consistently enhances predictions and outperforms state-of-the-art models in time series forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: CGFM advances the capabilities of flow matching and forecasting methods, offering improved accuracy and flexibility through error-guided learning.

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

*Haichen Hu,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the impact of pre-trained AI models on sequential decision-making when covariates are missing, introducing the notion of "model elasticity" and providing methods to improve decision outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pre-trained AI models influence decision-making outcomes when certain covariates are missing, and to provide a unified framework to assess the regret incurred from imputed covariates.

Method: The paper introduces "model elasticity" to measure reward sensitivity to imputation errors and explores sequential calibration of pre-trained models using orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression under the MAR setting.

Result: The integration of these methods improves imputed covariate quality, yielding better regret guarantees in decision-making tasks.

Conclusion: Accurate pre-trained models enhance decision-making processes, and the concept of model elasticity provides a framework to evaluate and optimize their performance in handling missing data.

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

### [200] [Combining Pre-Trained Models for Enhanced Feature Representation in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07197)
*Elia Piccoli,Malio Li,Giacomo Carfì,Vincenzo Lomonaco,Davide Bacciu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weight Sharing Attention (WSA), a method to combine embeddings from multiple pre-trained models to enhance state representations in Reinforcement Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While pre-trained models have advanced fields like NLP and Computer Vision and RL agents traditionally start from scratch, effectively combining multiple pre-trained models' embeddings for RL remains unexplored.

Method: The authors propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA), a novel architecture that integrates embeddings from multiple pre-trained models to create enriched state representations.

Result: WSA demonstrates comparable performance on several Atari games when compared to end-to-end methods, with insights into generalization and scaling effects.

Conclusion: WSA strikes a balance between efficiency and performance, showing potential for leveraging pre-trained models in RL to improve state representation.

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

*Arpana Sinhal,Anay Sinhal,Amit Sinhal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal dataset for stress monitoring in healthcare professionals using advanced machine learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nurses and healthcare workers experience high levels of occupational stress, intensified during COVID-19. Wearable sensors can help monitor stress in real-time, but existing studies face issues like incomplete datasets and weak methodologies.

Method: The study uses wearable data (like heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature), preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE for class balance, and machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron). A Stacking Classifier is also employed for enhanced prediction.

Result: The study created a robust and balanced dataset, tested several machine learning models, and developed a deployable pipeline for stress monitoring.

Conclusion: This research offers a scalable solution for monitoring stress in healthcare settings and emphasizes the importance of extending its demographic scope and exploring real-time applications.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAC learning framework is not ideal for changing data distributions and goals; prospective learning offers improvements and is extended to decision-making scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of PAC learning in adapting to dynamic data and changing objectives.

Method: Building on the prospective learning framework, the paper enhances the algorithm and evaluates it with numerical results, applying it to sequential decision-making scenarios.

Result: Improved algorithms were developed and tested, showing preliminary success in adapting to evolving data and goals.

Conclusion: Prospective learning provides a viable path for adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios, with promising initial results in sequential decision-making.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

*Yunyi Li,Maria De-Arteaga,Maytal Saar-Tsechansky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "DeCoLe," a framework for detecting mislabeled data affected by label bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address systematic label bias that impacts data reliability, particularly in social contexts.

Method: Proposed "Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe)," a machine learning approach to detect bias-induced mislabeled data.

Result: Empirical evaluation in hate speech detection shows DeCoLe outperforms other label error detection methods.

Conclusion: DeCoLe offers a reliable solution for bias-aware data quality improvements in organizational practices.

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

TL;DR: Q-chunking is a reinforcement learning method that improves sample efficiency and exploration through action chunking, focusing on long-horizon sparse-reward problems in offline-to-online RL settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of effective exploration and sample efficiency in offline-to-online RL for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.

Method: The paper introduces action chunking into temporal difference (TD)-based methods, allowing the agent to use temporally consistent behaviors for enhanced exploration and enabling unbiased $n$-step backups for stable TD learning.

Result: Q-chunking achieves strong offline performance and enhanced sample efficiency, outperforming existing methods in various long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Action chunking is a viable and effective technique to improve the efficiency and exploration capabilities of RL algorithms in offline-to-online settings.

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

*Minchan Jeong,J. Jon Ryu,Se-Young Yun,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable method for learning top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator using low-rank approximations, avoiding unstable operations and improving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address inefficiencies and instability in existing methods that compute leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator for stochastic systems.

Method: The proposed approach uses low-rank approximation in place of unstable operations like singular value decomposition or matrix inversion, integrating easily with deep learning techniques.

Result: Empirical results show that the method reliably learns singular subspaces and performs well in eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction tasks.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable, simple, and stable solution for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems, advancing existing Koopman operator learning techniques.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUSE, a method to enhance uncertainty estimates by aggregating outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) using information-theoretic measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often exhibit inconsistent outputs across inputs, necessitating better uncertainty quantification, especially in critical applications. The paper explores model diversity for enhanced calibration.

Method: The authors propose MUSE, which uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to select and combine subsets of LLMs for better uncertainty estimation and predictive performance.

Result: The experimental results on binary prediction tasks show that MUSE outperforms single LLMs and naive ensemble approaches in calibration and prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Aggregating outputs from well-calibrated subsets of LLMs via MUSE leads to better uncertainty quantification and overall performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a challenging dataset for modeling fracture using phase field modeling (PFM) and evaluates machine learning models like PINN, FNO, and UNet on the dataset to improve fracture mechanics research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in realistic and challenging benchmarks for machine learning (ML) methods used in fracture modeling, which is critical for advancing computational modeling in areas like uncertainty quantification and multi-scale modeling.

Method: The authors develop a dataset based on phase field modeling (PFM) simulations featuring diverse conditions and include baseline implementations of models such as Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), and UNet. They also explore ensembling strategies to assess their impact on fracture modeling accuracy.

Result: The study highlights strengths and weaknesses of popular ML models in modeling PFM-based fracture processes, establishing the dataset as a meaningful benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for advancing ML methods in solid mechanics, while also pointing out the limitations of existing models, providing a path for further research.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

*Giulio Rossolini,Fabio Brau,Alessandro Biondi,Battista Biggio,Giorgio Buttazzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper highlights a security vulnerability in distributed deep learning models, where intercepted intermediate features can enable adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate a new security risk arising in distributed deep learning systems, where intermediate features could be exploited.

Method: Proposes a strategy to reconstruct transmitted intermediate features and craft surrogate models to enable transferable adversarial attacks.

Result: Surrogate models trained with intercepted features significantly enhance adversarial attack transferability.

Conclusion: Intermediate feature leakage poses a major threat to distributed deep learning systems, emphasizing the need for stronger security mechanisms.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a multimodal approach combining IMU and radar sensors for improved food intake gesture detection and robustness under missing modality conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve dietary monitoring by leveraging multimodal sensor data (IMU and radar) for precise gesture detection and addressing robustness when one modality is unavailable.

Method: Proposed a robust multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA) to integrate data from wearable IMUs and contactless radar sensors.

Result: Achieved 4.3% and 5.2% improvement in F1-scores over unimodal models and maintained 1.3% and 2.4% performance gains under missing modality conditions. Released a dataset with gesture data from 52 participants.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the MM-TCN-CMA model in fusing multimodal data for gesture detection, marking a significant advancement in dietary monitoring technology.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

*Julianna Piskorz,Krzysztof Kacprzyk,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to model treatment effect trajectories over dose and time, focusing on smoother and clinically actionable insights beyond traditional Average Treatment Effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Average Treatment Effect is inadequate in capturing the dynamic, dose- and time-varying nature of treatment effects, especially vital in healthcare applications.

Method: They leverage and adapt the SemanticODE framework for modelling treatment effect trajectories, ensuring interpretability, robustness, support for priors, post-hoc edits, and analysis in causal settings.

Result: The proposed method produces accurate, interpretable, and editable models of treatment dynamics, enabling better causal analysis and decision-making.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the understanding of treatment effects over time and dose, offering insights for clinical and practical interventions with high reliability.

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Probabilistic Natural Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES) which improve sample efficiency in natural evolution strategies by incorporating Bayesian quadrature, outperforming existing methods like NES and Bayesian Optimisation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) are effective for black-box optimization problems utilizing prior knowledge, they suffer from poor sample efficiency due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates.

Method: ProbNES algorithms are proposed by integrating Bayesian quadrature into the NES framework, optimizing search distributions more effectively and addressing sample efficiency issues.

Result: ProbNES algorithms outperform conventional NES and global optimization methods like Bayesian Optimization ($\pi$BO) across diverse tasks, including benchmark tests, hyperparameter tuning, and locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: ProbNES represents a significant improvement over classical NES by addressing sample efficiency limitations and competes effectively with other global optimization methods.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

*Paola Causin,Alessio Marta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework utilizing Variational Autoencoders and Riemannian geometry to model low-dimensional manifolds in high-dimensional data, focusing on intrinsic dimensionality estimation, manifold charting, and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to leverage low-dimensional geometric structures (manifolds) in high-dimensional data for tasks such as manifold parameterization and efficient problem-solving, essential in machine learning and inverse problems.

Method: A Mixture of Variational Autoencoders framework is used, incorporating techniques from Riemannian geometry, to estimate the intrinsic dimension through VAE decoder metrics and build a manifold representation via invertible VAEs.

Result: The method improves inverse problem solutions in biomedical imaging by constraining reconstructions to learned manifolds and explores how pruning affects manifold geometry and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the utility of intrinsic dimensionality as a metric for model capacity and enhances manifold-based solutions for complex applications.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for operator learning models capable of bridging theoretical formulations and practical applications, particularly in multifidelity scenarios where input/output discretization varies.

Method: The authors proposed an encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning model, leveraging neural representations of bases for input/output functions and emphasizing discretization independence.

Result: Theoretical guarantees for uniform universal and statistical approximation were established. Numerical experiments on PDEs showed improved accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting the benefits of multifidelity training.

Conclusion: The study proves that discretization independence in operator learning allows for robust and efficient multifidelity learning, supported by theoretical and experimental validation.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in federated learning such as balancing privacy, model performance, and communication efficiency, especially in decentralized non-IID settings.

Method: Introduced a hybrid framework combining a CNN-PQC architecture, adaptive aggregation with privacy guarantees, selective homomorphic encryption, and layer-wise adaptive freezing.

Result: Achieved accuracy improvements of ~25.43% over Standard-FedQNN and ~14.17% over FHE-FedQNN on CIFAR-10, along with reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: AdeptHEQ-FL demonstrates significant gains in accuracy and efficiency, validating its resource-aware and privacy-preserving design for federated learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a secure and efficient clustered federated learning (CFL) design that optimizes communication and resource allocation using a novel reinforcement learning algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in CFL systems caused by limited resources in base stations, heterogeneous user data, and communication constraints while ensuring differential privacy.

Method: The method involves a dynamic penalty function assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm to optimize resource block allocation, user scheduling, privacy noise, and task clustering.

Result: The DPVD-MARL algorithm shows improved CFL performance, achieving a 20% faster convergence rate and 15% higher accumulated rewards over independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances CFL with secure, communication-efficient design, demonstrating superior performance in resource allocation and optimization challenges.

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses weaknesses in traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) for UAVs by using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to create stealthy adversarial attacks and a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of UAVs in civilian airspace requires upgraded IDS systems to detect novel and stealthy threats that evade traditional methods.

Method: The authors design a multi-class IDS classifier, train it on benign UAV telemetry and cyber-attacks, use cGAN to generate stealth attacks resembling OOD samples, and deploy a CVAE for probabilistic detection.

Result: Their CVAE-based detection method using regret scores outperformed traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

Conclusion: Enhanced probabilistic models like CVAE can significantly bolster IDS systems against adaptive and generative cyber attacks, improving UAV security.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

*Dongyu Wei,Xiaoren Xu,Yuchen Liu,H. Vincent Poor,Mingzhe Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a method to enhance privacy in collaborative model training using deceptive signals transmitted by selected device subsets. This approach minimizes data leaks to eavesdroppers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and security concerns in collaborative edge-based model training by mitigating data and model information leakage to eavesdroppers.

Method: A soft actor-critic reinforcement learning model with modules for intrinsic curiosity and cross-attention is proposed to dynamically assign devices for training and deceptive signal transmission without depending on eavesdropper positioning.

Result: The technique achieves 3x faster convergence and reduces leaked information by up to 13% compared to traditional SAC algorithms, showcasing greater privacy preservation and efficiency.

Conclusion: The method effectively safeguards collaborative model training from eavesdropper breaches while optimizing training energy and delay constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

*Malikussaid,Hilal Hudan Nuha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to bridge the 'plausibility-validity gap' in chemistry, using specialized datasets and adaptation techniques like LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce scientifically plausible but invalid information, especially in complex domains like chemistry. The paper aims to create a reliable scientific assistant to address this challenge.

Method: The study fine-tuned Magistral Small model with LoRA adaptation on a dual-domain dataset covering molecular properties and chemical reactions. It standardized data for quality and focused on improving chemical validity and synthesis feasibility.

Result: The modified model showed improved adherence to chemical formats, validity, and synthesis feasibility compared to the baseline. It performed well in chemical creativity and reasoning but had errors in stereochemistry and hallucinations.

Conclusion: This framework successfully adapts generalist LLMs for specialized chemical research, but additional improvements in areas like stereochemistry and static knowledge limitations are necessary.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer for graph transformers, improving interpretability and boosting accuracy by up to 3% in node-classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of blurring heterogeneous topologies in graph transformers that embed nodes in a single Euclidean space.

Method: The authors introduce a Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer that routes nodes to suitable manifolds (spherical, flat, hyperbolic) matching their local topology, incorporated into an ensemble graph transformer.

Result: The proposed approach achieves up to a 3% accuracy improvement across four node-classification benchmarks and enhances interpretability of the latent space.

Conclusion: Using explicit, geometry-aware projections in graph representations improves predictive performance and interpretability simultaneously.

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

*James Chapman,Kedar Karhadkar,Guido Montufar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of poor generalization in deep reinforcement learning when tested in varied contextual environments. The authors propose the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) and a sampling method called context sample enhancement (CSE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL policies often lack generalization to environments with different parameters, which is impractical for real-world applications. There is a need for methods that leverage problem structure efficiently while training on limited contexts.

Method: The authors introduce CEBE, which leverages transition and reward regularities in context parameters, and derive CSE as a practical data augmentation approach for deterministic environments.

Result: CEBE was shown both analytically and empirically to approximate the Q-function across multiple contexts accurately. CSE demonstrated improved generalization performance in simulated environments.

Conclusion: The paper introduces viable solutions for improving DRL generalization to varying contexts by leveraging regularities and efficient augmentation methods, making them potentially impactful for real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

*Farnam Mansouri,Shai Ben-David*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the statistical complexity of Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning, focusing on scenarios where the class prior is unknown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing PU learning methods that rely on restrictive assumptions, including knowledge of class prior, which limits their real-world applicability.

Method: Provides a theoretical analysis, presenting upper and lower sample size bounds for positive and unlabeled samples without relying on the assumption of known class prior.

Result: Established theoretical upper and lower bounds on the sample sizes required for effective PU learning while relaxing assumptions about class prior knowledge.

Conclusion: The study broadens the understanding of PU learning by relaxing unrealistic assumptions, thus enabling its applicability to more scenarios.

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

*Irsyad Adam,Steven Swee,Erika Yilin,Ethan Ji,William Speier,Dean Wang,Alex Bui,Wei Wang,Karol Watson,Peipei Ping*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical graph neural network called ATHENA which integrates patient-specific molecular data and cohort-wide clinical features to classify subclinical atherosclerosis, improving classification metrics and enabling explainable AI for personalized patient subtype discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current disease classification methods lack efficient integration of patient-specific molecular fingerprints with cohort-wide clinical features, needed for understanding diverse atherosclerotic trajectories.

Method: The ATHENA framework leverages hierarchical graph neural networks to combine clinical features and molecular data, utilizing integrated modality learning and enforcing alignment between individual and cohort-wide patterns.

Result: ATHENA significantly improves subclinical atherosclerosis classification by up to 13% in AUC and 20% in F1 score, demonstrating enhanced performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: ATHENA provides a novel mechanism for personalized intervention strategies and enables prediction and management of atherosclerotic disease progression through explainable AI-enabled subnetwork clustering.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper investigates reward hacking vulnerabilities in RLHF frameworks, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and proposes a novel unified modeling approach to improve robustness and scoring performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking undermines the effectiveness of aligning LLMs with human intent, especially in OOD scenarios, making it crucial to explore improved methodologies.

Method: The study introduces a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains Bradley-Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions within a shared embedding space.

Result: The proposed framework enhances the ability to mitigate reward hacking and improves multi-objective scoring, achieving significant performance gains, including a smaller model (7B) outperforming a larger baseline (70B).

Conclusion: The unified framework offers complementary advantages, improving both robustness in OOD conditions and overall scoring capability, representing a notable advancement in reward modeling for RLHF.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring ice layers is critical for understanding snow accumulation, ice dynamics, and reducing uncertainties in climate modeling. Current radar analyses require improvements in capturing spatial and temporal dynamics.

Method: GRIT employs an inductive geometric graph learning framework integrated with an attention mechanism to map spatial and temporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers from radar imagery.

Result: Compared to traditional graph neural networks, GRIT achieves consistently lower prediction errors, showcasing its robustness in modeling spatiotemporal dynamics.

Conclusion: GRIT enhances the analysis of ice layer thickness, effectively utilizing graph transformers and attention mechanisms to advance radar-based ice monitoring, promising improved climate model accuracy.

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal
ice layers in Radar imagery is essential in monitoring the snow accumulation,
better evaluating ice dynamics processes, and minimizing uncertainties in
climate models. Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, capture detailed
radargram images of internal ice layers. In this work, we introduce GRIT, graph
transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ice layer thickness and variability is vital for snow accumulation monitoring, ice dynamics, and improving climate model accuracy.

Method: ST-GRIT uses inductive geometric graph learning along with separate spatial and temporal attention blocks to process radargrams and capture relationships between ice layers.

Result: ST-GRIT demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods and baseline graph neural networks by achieving lower error rates in ice radargram analysis.

Conclusion: ST-GRIT's deployment of self-attention mechanisms and separate spatial-temporal attention blocks offers a more robust, noise-resistant, and effective solution for understanding internal ice layers in radar imagery.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method named TLC for enhanced sampling in molecular dynamics simulations, improving CV learning by focusing on time-lagged conditions rather than static distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events in molecular dynamics are hard to observe because of long timescales. The authors aim to improve biasing techniques by automating the discovery of collective variables (CVs) to better capture slow dynamics.

Method: They propose TLC, which uses time-lagged generative modeling to learn CVs, focusing on temporal dynamics rather than static states from the Boltzmann distribution.

Result: TLC was tested on Alanine Dipeptide for steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling (OPES), showing equal or better performance in sampling transitions and state discrimination compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: TLC effectively learns CVs by focusing on dynamic behaviors, improving enhanced sampling performance and addressing limitations of existing machine learning-based methods for CV discovery.

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of robust automated evaluation metrics to assess natural language-to-formal language translation, hampered by computational costs and limitations in theorem proving.

Method: The proposed GTED framework standardizes formal statements, converts them into operator trees, and uses a Generalized Tree Edit Distance metric to evaluate semantic similarity.

Result: GTED surpasses baseline metrics in semantic understanding, achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores on miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTED offers a more faithful, computationally viable evaluation methodology for statement autoformalization, advancing the capabilities of semantic similarity measurement.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental

TL;DR: The HGMP framework improves heterogeneous graph neural network tasks through unified task reformulation, graph-level contrastive pre-training, and feature prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the mismatch between pre-trained models and downstream tasks in heterogeneous graph neural networks.

Method: Introduces a multi-task prompt framework (HGMP) by reformulating downstream tasks, integrating graph-level contrastive pre-training, and refining graph features with heterogeneous feature prompts.

Result: Experimental results show HGMP adapts effectively to different tasks and outperforms baseline approaches on public datasets.

Conclusion: HGMP bridges pre-training and downstream task gaps, improves adaptation and performance in heterogeneous graph scenarios.

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

*Paul M. Riechers,Thomas J. Elliott,Adam S. Shai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals that neural networks inherently implement Bayesian-like updates on latent world models during inference, representing beliefs geometrically. This property is architecture-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether deep neural networks intrinsically represent beliefs and perform Bayesian updates on their training data during inference, despite lacking finite classical circuit equivalence.

Method: The authors analyzed deep neural networks such as transformers and RNNs trained on next-token prediction to study their intrinsic representation and mechanisms during inference.

Result: It was found that neural networks implicitly discover beliefs over generative models and establish geometric relationships among neural activations that are architecture-independent.

Conclusion: Neural networks intrinsically perform Bayesian-style belief updates and represent data relationships geometrically, surpassing what finite classical circuits can achieve.

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

TL;DR: This review discusses the potential of general-purpose models (GPMs), like large language models, to address challenges in chemical sciences using small, diverse datasets. It highlights their flexibility and capabilities while emphasizing their current prototype-stage development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by the unique nature of chemical datasets (small, diverse, fuzzy) and explore the transformative potential of general-purpose models (GPMs) in overcoming these limitations.

Method: The paper provides a review of foundational principles behind GPMs, such as large language models, and surveys their applications in chemical sciences across the scientific process.

Result: GPMs are highlighted as promising for handling diverse data formats and solving tasks beyond direct training, although most current applications are prototypes.

Conclusion: The growing interest in general-purpose models in chemical sciences is expected to lead to significant advancements, with many applications maturing in the near future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

### [231] [Resolving Token-Space Gradient Conflicts: Token Space Manipulation for Transformer-Based Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07485)
*Wooseong Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTME-MTL is a framework designed to enhance Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in transformer-based models by operating in token space, avoiding excessive parameter duplication and improving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTL suffers from negative transfer due to differences in task objectives, and pre-trained transformers have limitations in adaptability and fixed capacities.

Method: The paper introduces DTME-MTL, a mechanism that identifies gradient conflicts in token space and applies adaptive solutions based on conflict types, improving efficiency without duplicating network parameters.

Result: Experiments show DTME-MTL consistently enhances MTL performance while maintaining low computational overhead.

Conclusion: DTME-MTL is a scalable, efficient, and adaptable solution for improving transformer-based MTL architectures, overcoming challenges like negative transfer and excessive parameter growth.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

### [232] [Uncertainty Quantification for Motor Imagery BCI -- Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07511)
*Joris Suurmeijer,Ivo Pascal de Jong,Matias Valdenegro-Toro,Andreea Ioana Sburlea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates uncertainty quantification in standard and deep learning methods for Motor Imagery BCIs and proposes improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs offer functional outputs from brain signals, but challenges like accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimates persist. This study aims to bridge gaps in uncertainty quantification in BCI classifiers.

Method: Comparison of traditional BCI classifiers (CSP-LDA, MDRM) vs. deep learning approaches (Deep Ensembles, CNNs) with integration of Temperature Scaling for MDRM.

Result: MDRM is underconfident but improved with Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T), delivering effective uncertainty estimates. Deep Ensembles and CNNs are better at classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Combining models' separation abilities for ambiguous samples enhances BCI accuracy, where CSP-LDA and MDRM-T excel in uncertainty estimation, and CNNs perform best for classification accuracy.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

### [233] [Neural Concept Verifier: Scaling Prover-Verifier Games via Concept Encodings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07532)
*Berkant Turan,Suhrab Asadulla,David Steinmann,Wolfgang Stammer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a framework that combines Prover-Verifier Games and Concept Bottleneck Models for interpretable, nonlinear classification in high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prover-Verifier Games ensure model verifiability but are not yet usable for complex inputs like high-dimensional images. Concept Bottleneck Models provide interpretability but are restricted by their linear predictors. The paper aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: NCV combines Prover-Verifier Games with structured concept encodings derived from recent minimally supervised models. A prover selects a subset of concepts, and a nonlinear verifier uses these for decision-making.

Result: NCV surpasses both Concept Bottleneck Models and pixel-based Prover-Verifier Game classifiers in performance on high-dimensional datasets and reduces shortcut behavior.

Conclusion: NCV represents a significant advancement in creating interpretable, nonlinear, and high-dimensional verifiable AI systems.

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

### [234] [Real-Time Decorrelation-Based Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07559)
*Amirhossein Sadough,Mahyar Shahsavari,Mark Wijtvliet,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed a new method called DAD for real-time anomaly detection in multivariate time series using an online decorrelation learning approach, achieving high performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increase of IoT applications, there is a critical need for real-time anomaly detection methods capable of processing high-dimensional, streaming data without storing historical instances, ensuring fast decisions and low memory usage.

Method: The DAD method dynamically learns and monitors correlation structures sample by sample through an online decorrelation learning approach. It avoids traditional methods' reliance on processing full data windows or storing historical data.

Result: Through extensive benchmarking, DAD was found to outperform state-of-the-art methods in various anomaly types, showing robustness to high-dimensional data streams.

Conclusion: DAD provides an effective and efficient solution for real-time anomaly detection, balancing detection performance and computational constraints, and sets a new standard for memory-optimized AD in high-dimensional streams.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

### [235] [COALA: Numerically Stable and Efficient Framework for Context-Aware Low-Rank Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07580)
*Uliana Parkina,Maxim Rakhuba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an inversion-free, regularized framework to enhance stability in context-aware low-rank approximations used for neural network compression and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for context-aware low-rank approximation in neural networks suffer from numerical instability due to reliance on Gram matrix computation and inversion.

Method: The method uses stable decompositions to avoid Gram matrix inversion and includes provisions for challenging computation scenarios, offering mathematical proofs for convergence and error bounds.

Result: The proposed framework addresses numerical instabilities, handles calibration matrices exceeding GPU memory, deals with nearly singular activation matrices, and adapts to insufficient data scenarios.

Conclusion: The novel approach ensures robust and high-quality approximations even under difficult computational conditions, advancing compression and fine-tuning strategies for large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

*Michail Kalntis,Fernando A. Kuipers,George Iosifidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework utilizing meta-learning to optimize conditional handovers (CHOs) in cellular networks, outperforming 3GPP benchmarks by 180%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As cellular networks face increased complexity, traditional handovers struggle with delays and failures. 3GPP introduced CHOs to address these issues, but they bring new challenges like resource allocation and signaling overhead.

Method: The paper introduces a framework based on the O-RAN paradigm that employs meta-learning to optimize CHO processes efficiently while ensuring robust dynamic regret guarantees.

Result: The proposed framework achieved at least 180% better performance compared to 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Conclusion: Meta-learning integrated into CHO optimization can significantly improve handover efficiency in modern cellular networks, addressing challenges like resource use and communication overhead.

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

### [237] [Improving Clustering on Occupational Text Data through Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07582)
*Iago Xabier Vázquez García,Damla Partanaz,Emrullah Fatih Yetkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for clustering occupations in O*NET using BERT-based techniques and dimensionality reduction to create a mapping for varied task definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for mapping occupational definitions across different tasks, firms, or countries, stemming from the variation in O*NET descriptions.

Method: A pipeline using BERT-based techniques, various clustering approaches, and dimensionality reduction, enhanced with a specialized silhouette approach, was implemented.

Result: The proposed method produces improved clustering results, offering a way to distinguish occupations automatically.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective clustering-based mapping process that supports career transitions and expands O*NET's application to diverse occupational contexts.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

*Sebastian Lotter,Elisabeth Mohr,Andrina Rutsch,Lukas Brand,Francesca Ronchi,Laura Díaz-Marugán*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores leveraging synthetic molecular communication (SMC) for healthcare, focusing on modulating the gut-brain axis (GBA) for therapeutic applications using personal health data and machine learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current treatments for GBA modulation in neurological diseases are standardized and heuristic, limiting their efficacy across all patients. Personalized and robust treatments could improve outcomes.

Method: The authors propose defining theoretical requirements for GBA modulation and introducing a machine learning model to analyze limited datasets for identifying and evaluating GBA modulators.

Result: The proposed machine learning model demonstrated excellent accuracy in identifying various GBA modulators and revealed critical molecular signaling pathways relevant to therapeutic applications.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of machine learning-enhanced SMC systems to design personalized and effective GBA modulation treatments, advancing the integration of IoBNT devices in personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Result: SParSeFuL significantly lowers energy and bandwidth consumption compared to traditional FL approaches, making it better suited for large-scale, resource-constrained IoT applications.

Conclusion: SParSeFuL offers a promising resource-aware solution to align Federated Learning with sustainability goals, enabling effective use in green AI initiatives and IoT ecosystems.

Abstract: Federated Learning offers privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence but
struggles to meet the sustainability demands of emerging IoT ecosystems
necessary for Society 5.0-a human-centered technological future balancing
social advancement with environmental responsibility. The excessive
communication bandwidth and computational resources required by traditional FL
approaches make them environmentally unsustainable at scale, creating a
fundamental conflict with green AI principles as billions of

approach that bridges this gap by combining aggregate computing for
self-organization with neural network sparsification to reduce energy and
bandwidth consumption.

*Junyu Luo,Yuhao Tang,Yiwei Fu,Xiao Luo,Zhizhuo Kou,Zhiping Xiao,Wei Ju,Wentao Zhang,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLOGAN, a novel unsupervised graph domain adaptation method that enhances performance by addressing causal and spurious feature entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve graph domain adaptation methods by overcoming the limitations of causal-spurious feature entanglement and ineffective global alignment strategies.

Method: SLOGAN employs sparse causal modeling, variational inference to separate causal features from spurious ones, a generative intervention mechanism for tackling spurious correlations, and a category-adaptive calibration strategy for reliable learning.

Result: The proposed approach, SLOGAN, demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing methods in experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SLOGAN effectively disentangles causal features, addresses spurious correlations, and enables stable learning, thereby advancing performance in unsupervised graph domain adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer architecture, to improve Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data, achieving superior generalizability and accuracy compared to other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-based deep learning models are impactful for Parkinson's disease detection but suffer from poor generalizability due to high inter-subject variability.

Method: TransformEEG employs a hybrid design using depthwise convolutional tokenization and transformer encoder for better feature processing. The evaluation used four datasets with 290 subjects and a robust Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation.

Result: TransformEEG recorded the highest median balanced accuracy (78.45%) and lowest variability across partitions. Enhanced further with data augmentation, achieving 80.10% accuracy and reduced interquartile range.

Conclusion: TransformEEG demonstrates improved generalizability and reliability in Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data, addressing inter-subject variability issues faced by prior models.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized architecture combining Federated Split Learning (FSL) with Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) to enhance scalability and privacy in machine learning. This approach eliminates central coordination and achieves accuracy on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets with reduced training time compared to Ethereum-based solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for scalable and privacy-preserving solutions in collaborative machine learning for enterprise settings, addressing the drawbacks of conventional Federated Learning and Split Learning.

Method: The paper proposes integrating Federated Split Learning with the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric to enable decentralized training, using HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections for privacy while eliminating central co-ordination.

Result: The architecture matches centralized Federated Split Learning's accuracy on CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks, while reducing per epoch training time. Scalability tests show minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates enterprise-grade viability for decentralized and privacy-preserving machine learning, providing a promising solution to address scalability and privacy challenges in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

*Darshan Makwana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how the effective dimensionality of features evolves in fully-connected ReLU networks with finite-width layers, finding oscillatory rank behavior in layer activations and revealing geometric rank deficit decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the feature matrix rank evolves layer-by-layer in fully-connected ReLU networks, bridging gaps in expressivity and feature representation studies for finite-width architectures.

Method: Analyzes the rank of activation matrices for batches of inputs via theoretical derivation, capturing expected rank behaviors, oscillatory phenomena, and providing bounds and specific revival depths.

Result: Derives key mathematical expressions showcasing how rank deficit decays geometrically, demonstrates oscillatory rank behavior, identifies rank peaks at specific depths, and highlights differences under alternative weight initialization schemes, establishing finite-width characteristics.

Conclusion: Finite-width ReLU networks exhibit geometric decay and oscillatory phenomena in layerwise rank, which are nuanced aspects of feature representations. Strongly contrasting phenomena under alternative conditions highlight uniqueness in finite-width settings.

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

*Zhuang Qi,Lei Meng,Han Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedCBDR, a method in Federated Class Incremental Learning that uses global coordination and adaptive temperature scaling to tackle class imbalances in data replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in FCIL caused by class imbalances during data replay, which hinder performance in heterogeneous and incrementally arriving tasks.

Method: FedCBDR integrates a global-perspective data replay module to enable balanced memory reconstruction and a task-aware temperature scaling module for adaptive learning adjustment.

Result: Experimental results showed a 2%-15% improvement in Top-1 accuracy compared to six state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous and imbalanced conditions.

Conclusion: FedCBDR successfully alleviates class imbalance issues in FCIL and enhances generalization across tasks with incoming imbalanced data.

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and

### [245] [GuardVal: Dynamic Large Language Model Jailbreak Evaluation for Comprehensive Safety Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07735)
*Peiyan Zhang,Haibo Jin,Liying Kang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GuardVal, a novel protocol for evaluating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically generating jailbreak prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of evaluating LLM vulnerabilities in generating harmful content due to their evolving nature and the inefficacy of current benchmarks.

Method: GuardVal uses dynamic generation and refinement of jailbreak prompts, boosted by an optimization method preventing stagnation during prompt refinement.

Result: GuardVal was applied to various models, revealing distinct behaviors and weaknesses across 10 safety domains, enhancing the understanding of LLM robustness.

Conclusion: The insights from GuardVal can guide future research and aid in developing more secure LLMs.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

*Tomu Hirata,Undral Byambadalai,Tatsushi Oka,Shota Yasui,Shingo Uto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new neural network-based method to estimate detailed treatment effect distributions in randomized experiments, outperforming traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating distributional treatment effects struggle with precision in data extremes and inefficiency when handling large datasets.

Method: The authors propose using multi-task neural networks with shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to improve estimation accuracy.

Result: The method showed superior performance on both simulated and real-world datasets, including experiments on water conservation and A/B tests in streaming services.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical and robust solution for analyzing treatment effect heterogeneity in causal inference applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

### [247] [OPC: One-Point-Contraction Unlearning Toward Deep Feature Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07754)
*Jaeheun Jung,Bosung Jung,Suhyun Bae,Donghun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning addresses the removal of specific data influence from models for privacy or ethical compliance, but current methods often fail by retaining remnants of forgotten information internally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the limitation of existing unlearning methods which fail to deeply forget, leaving models vulnerable to data recovery and privacy breaches.

Method: The authors introduce "deep forgetting" as a theoretical criterion to address the issue and propose a novel algorithm called One-Point-Contraction (OPC) based on efficient algorithmic approximation.

Result: Empirical evaluation showcases OPC's ability to ensure better unlearning, outperform existing methods, and resist both training-free performance recovery and gradient-inversion attacks.

Conclusion: OPC’s design emphasizes deep feature forgetting, suggesting the importance for improved robustness in machine unlearning solutions for privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

### [248] [TRIX- Trading Adversarial Fairness via Mixed Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07768)
*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRIX, a novel adversarial training framework addressing unfair class-wise robustness in adversarial defenses, improving worst-case and overall accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods treat all classes uniformly, which leads to robustness disparities and adversarial unfairness between strong and weak classes.

Method: The proposed framework, TRIX, assigns weaker adversaries to strong classes and stronger adversaries to weak classes, incorporating per-class loss weighting and perturbation adjustments to balance robustness.

Result: TRIX improves worst-class accuracy and reduces inter-class robustness disparities while maintaining overall accuracy under strong attack evaluations.

Conclusion: TRIX is a practical and effective advancement toward achieving fair adversarial defense across varying class vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

### [249] [BEAVER: Building Environments with Assessable Variation for Evaluating Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07769)
*Ruohong Liu,Jack Umenberger,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structured approach to address the scalability and generalization challenges of reinforcement learning (RL) for building energy management across diverse operational scenarios and environmental dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scalability and generalization of RL in building energy management across diverse environments and operational scenarios remain underexplored, posing challenges in achieving efficient policies.

Method: The authors formulate a multi-objective contextual RL problem and introduce a principled way to parameterize contextual information. Additionally, they construct a novel benchmark to evaluate generalizable RL algorithms in building energy management tasks.

Result: Existing multi-objective RL algorithms achieve reasonable trade-offs between objectives but struggle when facing environmental variations, highlighting the need for context-awareness.

Conclusion: Incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into RL policy learning is key to improving performance across diverse building operational scenarios and environmental dynamics.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

*Wooseong Jeong,Jegyeong Cho,Youngho Yoon,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces S4T, a novel Test-Time Training (TTT) method addressing the issue of task synchronization in multi-task scenarios under domain shifts, proving its superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance degradation in neural networks caused by domain shifts when handling multiple tasks and the inability of conventional TTT methods to synchronize tasks effectively.

Method: Proposes S4T (Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training), which synchronizes tasks by predicting inter-task relations during domain shifts, and validates it on multi-task benchmarks integrated with traditional TTT protocols.

Result: S4T demonstrated better performance than state-of-the-art TTT methods across various multi-task benchmarks, effectively synchronizing tasks during test-time.

Conclusion: S4T successfully mitigates the challenges of unsynchronized task behavior in TTT scenarios, offering a robust solution for generalizing neural networks to unseen domains with multiple tasks.

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

### [251] [Space-Filling Regularization for Robust and Interpretable Nonlinear State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07792)
*Hermann Klein,Max Heinz Herkersdorf,Oliver Nelles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a space-filling regularization technique to improve state distribution in nonlinear system identification, addressing issues of poor data coverage and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges caused by significant deformations in state trajectories during training, which hinder training algorithms and affect interpretability and robustness.

Method: The paper presents a data-distribution-based penalty for space-filling regularization, applied to local model network architectures, and demonstrates its use on a benchmark system.

Result: The proposed regularization technique ensures better data distribution in state space, improving training and interpretability of local state space models.

Conclusion: The space-filling regularization enhances the state trajectory distribution in nonlinear systems, offering improved robustness and interpretability for system identification.

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

*Alba Garrido,Alejandro Almodóvar,Patricia A. Apellániz,Juan Parras,Santiago Zazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMVAE, a deep learning framework for survival analysis integrating six data modalities, achieving competitive performance and novel capabilities like competing risks modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve survival prediction in oncology by addressing the limitations of traditional methods that rely on single data modalities, which fail to capture the complexity of tumor biology.

Method: SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal Variational Autoencoder) is a multimodal deep learning model that leverages six data modalities and employs modality-specific encoders to integrate these into a shared latent space for robust survival prediction.

Result: The SAMVAE model was evaluated on breast cancer and lower-grade glioma cohorts, demonstrating competitive performance against state-of-the-art models in survival analysis and competing risks scenarios.

Conclusion: SAMVAE establishes a novel, clinically interpretable foundation for survival predictions in oncology, integrating diverse data and introducing parametric deep learning for competing risks modeling.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a refined Lipschitz bound for self-attention in transformers, explains its dependence on attention maps' distribution, and proposes a novel regularization technique for improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the influence of attention maps' scores on robustness and improving transformer models' local Lipschitz constants.

Method: Develop a new local Lipschitz bound leveraging a refined spectral norm formula for softmax and propose a regularization term named JaSMin.

Result: JaSMin boosts transformer robustness and reduces their local Lipschitz constants, demonstrating the efficacy of the theoretical advancements.

Conclusion: The findings enhance the theoretical understanding of self-attention mechanisms and offer practical tools for improving transformer robustness.

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enabling tabular data foundation models to handle textual data by curation and strategy development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in benchmarks for tabular datasets with textual columns and improve text incorporation into tabular pipelines.

Method: Ablation-style strategies for integrating text with tabular pipelines, and manual curation of real-world tabular datasets enriched with textual features.

Result: Demonstration of how tabular foundation models handle textual features, and improved benchmarking standards.

Conclusion: This research marks progress toward enhancing foundation models for tabular data with textual elements for real-world applicability.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm that extracts interpretable policies, such as linear policies, from expert behavior using the advantage function, with theoretical guarantees. It proves effective on control environments and financial trading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of interpretability in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), making it challenging to understand learned patterns and feature importance, especially in mission-critical and real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors developed an algorithm leveraging the advantage function to extract interpretable policies while considering expert behavior. Unlike previous approaches, it utilizes pre-collected experience for training.

Result: The algorithm demonstrated its efficacy by extracting interpretable yet meaningful policies when tested in classic control environments and a financial trading scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges the gap between interpretability and performance in RL by enabling simpler, understandable policies without compromising crucial characteristics of expert behavior.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the theoretical difficulty in guaranteeing convergence for variational inference methods using natural-gradient descent, even for simple cases with concave log-likelihoods and Gaussian approximations.

Method: The authors propose a square-root parameterization for the Gaussian covariance in variational inference, allowing them to establish theoretical convergence guarantees for natural-gradient descent and its continuous-time gradient flow.

Result: The results show that natural-gradient methods are effective and outperform alternative algorithms based on Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries in experiments.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the square-root parameterization enhances theoretical guarantees for natural-gradient methods in variational inference and demonstrates their effectiveness and advantages empirically.

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Motivation: SMEs are crucial to the economy, but their credit risk evaluation is hindered by limited available data, especially for online lenders lacking credit records.

Method: The paper presents a GNN-based framework that leverages interactions from transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and improve loan default risk predictions.

Result: The GNN model outperforms traditional methods with AUCs of 0.995 for supply chain mining and 0.701 for loan default prediction on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit.

Conclusion: This scalable GNN framework enables better SME credit risk assessment, helps regulators assess supply chain disruption impacts, and supports stress testing by central banks.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a unified framework connecting ML preference learning theories (loss functions and stochastic choice), emphasizing direct preference optimization's role and implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to understand direct preference optimization (DPO) from a general principled viewpoint due to its numerous applications and growing relevance in machine learning.

Method: The method involves establishing connections between Savage's loss functions and stochastic choice theory, highlighting their encompassing features for various extensions and scenarios, including non-convex objectives.

Result: Key results include showing how DPO aligns with generalized theories, supports abstention, handles non-convex objectives, and enables framing of various extensions.

Conclusion: Understanding the general principles behind DPO provides clarity on its operations, highlights current limitations, and suggests ways to work around pitfalls in this machine learning framework.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

TL;DR: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing challenge, and ApexOracle is an AI model designed to predict antibacterial potency and generate new antibiotic molecules, even for pathogens it hasn’t seen before.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the urgent need for effective antibiotics due to the global rise of AMR and the lag in current antibiotic development.

Method: The researchers developed ApexOracle, a model that integrates molecular features using a discrete diffusion language model and a dual-embedding framework combining genomic and literature-derived data.

Result: ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models in predicting antibacterial activity and showed strong reliability in addressing novel pathogens with minimal data.

Conclusion: ApexOracle offers a scalable AI-driven solution for combating AMR by combining rapid activity prediction with the ability to design innovative antibiotic molecules.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Motivation: Current synthetic data augmentation methods often require structural references, limiting flexibility and efficiency in training scoring functions for binding affinity prediction.

Method: It utilizes co-folding models and establishes heuristics to identify high-quality co-folding predictions without relying on reference structures.

Result: Performance gains are critically influenced by the structural quality of augmented data, and the proposed heuristics effectively identify such high-quality predictions.

Conclusion: Co-folding models can replace experimental structures in training MLSFs, paving the way for refined data augmentation strategies.

Abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of using co-folding models for synthetic data
augmentation in training machine learning-based scoring functions (MLSFs) for
binding affinity prediction. Our results show that performance gains depend
critically on the structural quality of augmented data. In light of this, we
established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning often faces task conflicts, where differing task gradients hinder performance. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) offers potential to resolve these conflicts.

Method: The authors propose SAMO, combining global and approximated local perturbations using only forward passes with layerwise normalization, aiming to mitigate task conflicts efficiently.

Result: SAMO outperforms baseline methods in effectiveness and efficiency on several multi-task learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAMO successfully integrates SAM into multi-task learning by addressing task conflicts and computational overheads, showcasing practical improvements with widespread applicability.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

*Ashe Neth,Sawinder kaur,Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan,Subrata Biswas,Asif Salekin,Bashima Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnIT is an unstructured, inference-time pruning method for deep neural networks, reducing computations and energy usage without retraining or hardware specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency on microcontrollers without relying on structured sparsity, retraining, or specialized hardware.

Method: Dynamically identifies and skips unneeded operations during inference based on input-specific activation patterns, replacing multiplications with lightweight comparisons and approximated divisions.

Result: Achieves up to 82.03% reduction in computations, 84.19% faster inference, and 84.38% lower energy consumption on MSP430, maintaining accuracy within 0.48-7%.

Conclusion: UnIT effectively facilitates efficient, hardware-friendly, and retraining-free deployment of neural networks, outperforming training-time pruned models in many scenarios.

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

*Anant Gupta,Rajarshi Bhowmik,Geoffrey Gunow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-agent-based system for dynamically tracking topics in companies' earnings calls, enabling the discovery of emerging trends and relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling techniques fail to effectively capture dynamic, emerging topics in financial contexts such as earnings calls due to industry evolution.

Method: The authors developed an LLM-agent that extracts topics, organizes them into a hierarchical ontology, and identifies relationships between new and pre-existing topics.

Result: The approach effectively identifies company-level insights, tracks emerging trends, and performs well on metrics like ontology coherence and topic evolution accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology offers a robust solution to track dynamic trends within earnings calls, facilitating financial trend analysis and strategic understanding.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

### [266] [Low Resource Reconstruction Attacks Through Benign Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07947)
*Sol Yarkoni,Roi Livni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new attack on generative models enabling unintended reconstruction of training set images using benign prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address privacy risks and vulnerabilities in generative models, particularly concerning image reconstruction from training data.

Method: They developed a low-resource attack using domain knowledge, avoiding direct access to the training set, by exploiting e-commerce platform data patterns tied to prompts.

Result: The attack demonstrates that a seemingly innocent prompt, like 'blue Unisex T-Shirt,' can unintentionally generate the image of a real-life individual.

Conclusion: Generative models face critical vulnerabilities where benign user prompts may unintentionally reconstruct sensitive data, underscoring the need for better controls and safeguards.

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

### [267] [Dynamic Chunking for End-to-End Hierarchical Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07955)
*Sukjun Hwang,Brandon Wang,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces hierarchical networks (H-Nets) that replace conventional tokenization workflows, enabling a fully end-to-end language model operating directly on bytes. This results in better scalability, performance, and robustness compared to traditional token-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate tokenization as a barrier in end-to-end language models, aiming for better scalability and efficiency with unprocessed data by removing the need for manual preprocessing heuristics.

Method: Developed hierarchical networks (H-Nets) that dynamically segment content based on learned strategies while training jointly with the model. The system operates on bytes and allows multi-stage hierarchies for modeling abstractions.

Result: H-Nets outperformed byte-pair encoding (BPE)-based Transformer models on various tasks, showed better data scaling, and demonstrated improved data efficiency in challenging domains like Chinese, code, and DNA sequences.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of H-Nets as robust, scalable, and efficient true end-to-end models for handling raw data without reliance on tokenization.

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

### [268] [EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07986)
*Perry Dong,Qiyang Li,Dorsa Sadigh,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses stable training of expressive policies using reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a method combining imitation learning with a lightweight edit policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the instability challenges in training expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies in RL scenarios involving offline datasets.

Method: The EXPO algorithm combines a large expressive base policy trained with imitation learning and a lightweight Gaussian edit policy, which refines actions for value maximization using an on-the-fly RL approach.

Result: EXPO demonstrates 2-3x sample efficiency improvements compared to prior RL methods in both fine-tuning pretrained policies and training using offline data.

Conclusion: Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO) is presented as a solution for stable and sample-efficient RL training of complex policies, leveraging imitation learning and action refinement strategies.

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

### [269] [Skip a Layer or Loop it? Test-Time Depth Adaptation of Pretrained LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07996)
*Ziyue Li,Yang Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how pretrained neural networks can dynamically adapt their architectures at inference time for improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether pretrained large language models (LLMs) require all layers for simple tasks and whether those layers are sufficient for complex tasks. There is an opportunity to make neural networks more efficient and accurate by dynamically adapting their architectures to the input.

Method: The researchers introduced the "chain-of-layers" (CoLa) approach where layers of pretrained LLMs can be skipped, pruned, or repeated in arbitrary configurations. A Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) protocol was used to identify the optimal CoLa for individual test samples from math and commonsense reasoning tasks.

Result: The study revealed that over 75% of correctly predicted samples could achieve shorter CoLas, improving inference efficiency, and over 60% of originally incorrect predictions could be corrected by identifying optimized CoLas, thereby enhancing model performance.

Conclusion: The research highlights the limitations of fixed architectures in pretrained LLMs and demonstrates the benefits of test-time depth adaptation to improve efficiency and accuracy across varying inputs.

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

*Andrew Fan,Simon D. Levy*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for accelerating spiking neural networks (SNNs) using a low-end FPGA, which is efficient and accessible for broader communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing computational demands of neural networks while reducing power consumption and improving accessibility for SNN acceleration hardware. Current architectures are either inaccessible or require expensive hardware.

Method: The authors propose an SNN acceleration framework combining a robust FPGA architecture featuring a synaptic array and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. It is designed to target low-end FPGAs and support any-to-any or fully connected SNNs.

Result: The framework runs on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieving competitive speed for MNIST digit recognition (0.52 ms per image) and accurate simulation of hand-coded SNNs for toy problems. The system is resource-efficient, utilizing minimal FPGA resources.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates the feasibility of deploying SNNs on low-end FPGAs with good performance and efficiency, offering an accessible solution for the wider community interested in neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: As the demand for compute power in traditional neural networks has increased
significantly, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential
solution to increasingly power-hungry neural networks. By operating on 0/1
spikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate
operations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for
more efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating
and simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and
SpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider
community. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve
as a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many
proposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN
topology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN
acceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting
any-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a
synaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture
targets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources.
The framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves
competitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img). Further
experiments also show accurate simulation of hand coded any-to-any spiking
neural networks on toy problems. All code and setup instructions are available

### [271] [Homeostatic Adaptation of Optimal Population Codes under Metabolic Stress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07874)
*Yi-Chun Hung,Gregory Schwartz,Emily A. Cooper,Emma Alexander*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework for neuronal population coding that incorporates energy constraints and noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand how neurons adapt to metabolic stress, such as entering a 'low power mode' while maintaining firing rate homeostasis, a behavior not addressed by existing mathematical models.

Method: The paper introduces a population coding framework based on two constraints: firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit linked to noise levels. The model incorporates biophysical simulations and an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model tied to cellular energy budgets.

Result: The framework analytically derives optimal coding strategies under energy constraints, capturing how tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis. These changes align with empirical observations under conditions like caloric deprivation.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a generalization of population codes by directly linking ATP usage to neuronal noise and coding strategies, providing a measurable and explainable approach to understanding energy-limited neural dynamics.

Abstract: Information processing in neural populations is inherently constrained by
metabolic resource limits and noise properties, with dynamics that are not
accurately described by existing mathematical models. Recent data, for example,
shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a "low power mode" in which
they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This
adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in
response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding
framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple
constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit
tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our
contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework
that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our
simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on
the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the
least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each
state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential
and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments
and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We
analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying
energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how
populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been
observed empirically.

TL;DR: Propositional program equivalence, a variant of general program equivalence, is decidable and feasible when abstracting away statement semantics using Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (G)KAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General program equivalence is undecidable in its pure form, prompting the need for alternative frameworks to simplify and address specific equivalence problems that are both decidable and practical.

Method: Utilizes the framework of (Guarded) Kleene Algebra with Tests, or (G)KAT, to understand and evaluate propositional program equivalence by abstracting away the semantics of statements.

Result: Propositional program equivalence was shown to be decidable irrespective of conditions ($b$, $e$, $f$). This equivalence is validated within the (G)KAT framework, facilitating feasible comparisons of program structures.

Conclusion: Propositional program equivalence offers a promising subdomain where practical and decidable results can be achieved using algebraic methods, simplifying some aspects of program equivalence challenges.

Abstract: General program equivalence is undecidable. However, if we abstract away the
semantics of statements, then this problem becomes not just decidable, but
practically feasible. For instance, a program of the form "if $b$ then $e$ else
$f$" should be equivalent to "if not $b$ then $f$ else $e$" - no matter what
$b$, $e$ and $f$ are. This kind of equivalence is known as propositional
equivalence. In this extended abstract, we discuss recent developments in
propositional program equivalence from the perspective of (Guarded) Kleene
Algebra with Tests, or (G)KAT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving better efficiency and accuracy in SLAM applications using Cartographer by comparing its default solver (Ceres) with an alternative (g2o).

Method: Comparative experiments evaluating the performance of the g2o and Ceres solvers in SLAM applied within the Cartographer framework, with tests conducted under real-world conditions using the AgileX LIMO robot.

Result: Ceres demonstrated faster convergence, required fewer iterations, and produced more accurate maps in most cases, while g2o performed better in localized obstacle detection.

Conclusion: Ceres is more effective for general SLAM tasks in Cartographer, but g2o has niche strengths in obstacle detection, suggesting solver choice depends on application-specific needs.

Abstract: This article presents a comparative analysis of g2o and Ceres solvers in
enhancing scan matching performance within the Cartographer framework.
Cartographer, a widely-used library for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM), relies on optimization algorithms to refine pose estimates and improve
map accuracy. The research aims to evaluate the performance, efficiency, and
accuracy of the g2o solver in comparison to the Ceres solver, which is the
default in Cartographer. In our experiments comparing Ceres and g2o within
Cartographer, Ceres outperformed g2o in terms of speed, convergence efficiency,
and overall map clarity. Ceres required fewer iterations and less time to
converge, producing more accurate and well-defined maps, especially in
real-world mapping scenarios with the AgileX LIMO robot. However, g2o excelled
in localized obstacle detection, highlighting its value in specific situations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current robotic dressing systems, such as inefficiency, safety concerns, and the need for constrained user postures, and to create a system better suited for handling deformable garments.

Method: The study introduces the SWAG system that employs an unfurling and growth mechanism for autonomous dressing, avoiding skin-garment friction. Included are its working principles, design, fabrication, and performance trials.

Result: SWAG effectively assisted with garment application across various configurations, indicating its potential adaptability and utility for dressing assistance.

Conclusion: SWAG offers a promising, safer, and more efficient alternative to conventional robotic dressing systems, particularly for aiding individuals with limited mobility.

Abstract: Robotic dressing assistance has the potential to improve the quality of life
for individuals with limited mobility. Existing solutions predominantly rely on
rigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable
garments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior
robotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control
strategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and
adaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the
Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth
mechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches,the
SWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling based deployment method,
eliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient
dressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its
design and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance.
The proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study presents a newly designed steerable vine robot optimized for navigation in cramped environments such as pipes and burrows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robots struggle with navigating confined environments and adapting to sharp turns and branches in manmade and natural passageways.

Method: The robot uses an external tip mount for steering, enabling three degrees of freedom by altering its growth direction and bracing against walls when needed.

Result: The robot achieved a maximum steerable angle of 51.7°, maneuvered through pipes with 2.5 cm radii, navigated sharp turns, and localized in GPS-denied environments using sensors and body odometry.

Conclusion: The steerable vine robot demonstrates its capability to handle challenging environments effectively, showcasing improved adaptability and navigation features.

Abstract: Navigation and inspection in confined environments, such as tunnels and
pipes, pose significant challenges for existing robots due to limitations in
maneuverability and adaptability to varying geometries. Vine robots, which are
soft growing continuum robots that extend their length through soft material
eversion at their tip, offer unique advantages due to their ability to navigate
tight spaces, adapt to complex paths, and minimize friction. However, existing
vine robot designs struggle with navigation in manmade and natural passageways,
with branches and sharp 3D turns. In this letter, we introduce a steerable vine
robot specifically designed for pipe and burrow environments. The robot
features a simple tubular body and an external tip mount that steers the vine
robot in three degrees of freedom by changing the growth direction and, when
necessary, bracing against the wall of the pipe or burrow. Our external tip
steering approach enables: (1) active branch selection in 3D space with a
maximum steerable angle of 51.7{\deg}, (2) navigation of pipe networks with
radii as small as 2.5 cm, (3) a compliant tip enabling navigation of sharp
turns, and (4) real-time 3D localization in GPS-denied environments using
tip-mounted sensors and continuum body odometry. We describe the forward
kinematics, characterize steerability, and demonstrate the system in a 3D pipe
system as well as a natural animal burrow.

Method: The authors created LangNav, a meticulously curated dataset with varied descriptions (categories, attributes, relations), and introduced LangNavBench to systematically evaluate agents' navigation capabilities. They also developed MLFM, a mapping technique tailored for spatial relations and small object detection.

Result: LangNav boasts a lower error rate compared to existing datasets. MLFM achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art semantic navigation methods tested on LangNav.

Conclusion: LangNavBench and MLFM collectively push the boundaries of language-grounded navigation systems and provide new avenues for research and evaluation in this domain.

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in
language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target
object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a
clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the
words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set
dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects
described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine
attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was
manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and
semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a
benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand
and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench
allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,
spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first
thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also
present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable
multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small
objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms
state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

### [277] [Classifying Emergence in Robot Swarms: An Observer-Dependent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07315)
*Ricardo Vega,Cameron Nowzari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes that definitions of 'swarm' and 'emergence' are subjective, based on the observer's perspective rather than objective system properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity and lack of consensus surrounding the definitions of 'swarm' and 'emergence,' complicating understanding and communication in the field.

Method: Introduce a framework separating externally observable states from latent, unobservable ones to rigorously compare existing definitions.

Result: The paper argues that the definitions of swarm and emergence are shaped by observer perception and tacit knowledge rather than being intrinsic to the system.

Conclusion: Clarifying these definitions helps differentiate robotic swarm systems from multi-robot systems, supporting better systems design and deployment.

Abstract: Emergence and swarms are widely discussed topics, yet no consensus exists on
their formal definitions. This lack of agreement makes it difficult not only
for new researchers to grasp these concepts, but also for experts who may use
the same terms to mean different things. Many attempts have been made to
objectively define 'swarm' or 'emergence,' with recent work highlighting the
role of the external observer. Still, several researchers argue that once an
observer's vantage point (e.g., scope, resolution, context) is established, the
terms can be made objective or measured quantitatively. In this note, we
propose a framework to discuss these ideas rigorously by separating externally
observable states from latent, unobservable ones. This allows us to compare and
contrast existing definitions of swarms and emergence on common ground. We
argue that these concepts are ultimately subjective-shaped less by the system
itself than by the perception and tacit knowledge of the observer.
Specifically, we suggest that a 'swarm' is not defined by its group behavior
alone, but by the process generating that behavior. Our broader goal is to
support the design and deployment of robotic swarm systems, highlighting the
critical distinction between multi-robot systems and true swarms.

### [278] [Effects of Wrist-Worn Haptic Feedback on Force Accuracy and Task Speed during a Teleoperated Robotic Surgery Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07327)
*Brian B. Vuong,Josie Davidson,Sangheui Cheon,Kyujin Cho,Allison M. Okamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study investigates the use of wrist-worn haptic feedback in robotic-assisted surgery to improve force accuracy in teleoperated tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-based haptic feedback in robot-assisted surgery interferes with console controls. This research explores relocating feedback to the wrist to avoid this limitation.

Method: Participants used a wrist-worn pneumatic haptic device to perform a palpation task using a robot. Force accuracy with and without wrist feedback was compared.

Result: The addition of wrist-worn haptic feedback significantly reduced force application errors but increased task completion time.

Conclusion: Wrist-worn haptic feedback improves accuracy in force application during teleoperated tasks, though it impacts task speed by altering the speed-accuracy tradeoff.

Abstract: Previous work has shown that the addition of haptic feedback to the hands can
improve awareness of tool-tissue interactions and enhance performance of
teleoperated tasks in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However,
hand-based haptic feedback occludes direct interaction with the manipulanda of
surgeon console in teleoperated surgical robots. We propose relocating haptic
feedback to the wrist using a wearable haptic device so that haptic feedback
mechanisms do not need to be integrated into the manipulanda. However, it is
unknown if such feedback will be effective, given that it is not co-located
with the finger movements used for manipulation. To test if relocated haptic
feedback improves force application during teleoperated tasks using da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot, participants learned to palpate a phantom
tissue to desired forces. A soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device with an
anchoring system renders tool-tissue interaction forces to the wrist of the
user. Participants performed the palpation task with and without wrist-worn
haptic feedback and were evaluated for the accuracy of applied forces.
Participants demonstrated statistically significant lower force error when
wrist-worn haptic feedback was provided. Participants also performed the
palpation task with longer movement times when provided wrist-worn haptic
feedback, indicating that the haptic feedback may have caused participants to
operate at a different point in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniTracker integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) into robot control frameworks, enabling more diverse, robust, and generalizable humanoid motion in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with limited motion diversity and poor generalization in humanoid robot control when operating in human-centric environments.

Method: Introduce a CVAE-based approach integrated into the student policy to retain diverse motion characteristics, improve robustness, and adapt to partial observations.

Result: UniTracker outperforms baseline models in motion quality, generalization to unknown scenarios, and real-world deployment robustness.

Conclusion: UniTracker provides a practical, scalable solution for humanoid robots requiring expressive and reliable control in challenging environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robots must achieve diverse, robust, and generalizable whole-body
control to operate effectively in complex, human-centric environments. However,
existing methods, particularly those based on teacher-student frameworks often
suffer from a loss of motion diversity during policy distillation and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen behaviors. In this work, we present
UniTracker, a simplified yet powerful framework that integrates a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) into the student policy to explicitly model the
latent diversity of human motion. By leveraging a learned CVAE prior, our
method enables the student to retain expressive motion characteristics while
improving robustness and adaptability under partial observations. The result is
a single policy capable of tracking a wide spectrum of whole-body motions with
high fidelity and stability. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world deployments demonstrate that UniTracker significantly outperforms
MLP-based DAgger baselines in motion quality, generalization to unseen
references, and deployment robustness, offering a practical and scalable
solution for expressive humanoid control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of kinematic modeling in soft robots using machine learning and focuses on uncertainty quantification for prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots have highly nonlinear and complex behaviors, making precise kinematic modeling essential but challenging for calibration and control design.

Method: The authors explore multiple machine learning models, identify ensemble methods for generalization, and propose a conformal kinematic modeling framework to quantify predictive uncertainty.

Result: Nonlinear ensemble models demonstrated robust performance for modeling, and a conformal framework provides theoretically guaranteed uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves kinematic modeling accuracy and robustness in soft robots by addressing prediction uncertainty with a distribution-free method.

Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design
for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear
and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine
learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics.
However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively
affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling
in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and
real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine
learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The
results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust
generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling
framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify
predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction
intervals with a theoretical guarantee.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes PILOC, a decentralized multi-agent search and rescue (MASAR) framework using pheromone-based guidance and local communication, which enhances search efficiency and system adaptability in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MASAR operations face challenges in dynamic and unknown environments due to target unpredictability and the lack of global knowledge.

Method: The framework, PILOC, leverages a pheromone inverse guidance mechanism integrated with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), enabling decentralized agent cooperation through local perception and communication.

Result: Experimental results show that PILOC improves search efficiency, adaptability, and robustness compared to conventional methods, especially in scenarios with communication constraints.

Conclusion: PILOC offers a new approach for MASAR applications by embedding environmental cues into DRL-based architectures, promising enhanced performance in real-world dynamic and communication-limited conditions.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster
response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown
environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and
environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a
framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local
perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance
mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization.
PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication,
significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional
heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based
on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based
multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that
combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly
boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to
existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and
communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future
MASAR applications.

*Korbinian Moller,Rafael Neher,Marvin Seegert,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a safeguarding concept for motion planning in autonomous vehicles, emphasizing runtime trajectory verification with a novel time safeguard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the functional safety of motion planning in autonomous vehicles, particularly for complex or learning-based software, by addressing limitations in current online verification methods.

Method: The paper introduces a time safeguard mechanism to ensure temporal consistency in planning outputs, implemented using constraint-based feasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics on a real-time operating system.

Result: Preliminary results show the safeguarding module works within real-time constraints and identifies unsafe trajectories effectively. However, full integration of the time safeguard logic and fallback mechanisms is still underway.

Conclusion: The study presents a modular framework for real-time trajectory verification and lays the groundwork for future testing and deployment on automotive-grade systems.

Abstract: Ensuring the functional safety of motion planning modules in autonomous
vehicles remains a critical challenge, especially when dealing with complex or
learning-based software. Online verification has emerged as a promising
approach to monitor such systems at runtime, yet its integration into embedded
real-time environments remains limited. This work presents a safeguarding
concept for motion planning that extends prior approaches by introducing a time
safeguard. While existing methods focus on geometric and dynamic feasibility,
our approach additionally monitors the temporal consistency of planning outputs
to ensure timely system response. A prototypical implementation on a real-time
operating system evaluates trajectory candidates using constraint-based
feasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics. Preliminary results
show that the safeguarding module operates within real-time bounds and
effectively detects unsafe trajectories. However, the full integration of the
time safeguard logic and fallback strategies is ongoing. This study contributes
a modular and extensible framework for runtime trajectory verification and
highlights key aspects for deployment on automotive-grade hardware. Future work
includes completing the safeguarding logic and validating its effectiveness
through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and vehicle-based testing. The code is

*Juyeop Han,Lukas Lao Beyer,Guilherme V. Cavalheiro,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for autonomous flights in GPS-denied indoor spaces using a perception-aware trajectory optimizer to minimize visual localization errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable and precise autonomous flight in GPS-denied indoor environments, as visual-inertial odometry accumulates drift over time, necessitates new techniques like scene coordinate regression for drift-free pose estimation.

Method: The framework integrates an evidential learning-based SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer, which adjusts the onboard camera based on pixel uncertainty, and a fixed-lag smoother to fuse SCR and IMU data in real time.

Result: The method reduces translation errors by 54%/15% and rotational errors by 40%/31% in simulation compared to baselines, and is validated through a hardware-in-the-loop experiment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces localization errors and demonstrates feasibility in both simulation and experimental settings, making it suitable for autonomous flight in challenging environments.

Abstract: Autonomous flight in GPS denied indoor spaces requires trajectories that keep
visual localization error tightly bounded across varied missions. Whereas
visual inertial odometry (VIO) accumulates drift over time, scene coordinate
regression (SCR) yields drift-free, high accuracy absolute pose estimation. We
present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based
SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer
steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable
scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream
with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In
simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15%
(40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively.
Moreover, hardware in the loop experiment validates the feasibility of our
proposed framework.

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient algorithm for modular robot configuration that minimizes time and energy by matching initial and target configurations using a utility-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently configuring modular robotics systems with minimal time and energy consumption, inspired by tasks requiring specific target configurations.

Method: The authors propose a graph isomorphism-based algorithm where modules align with target configurations through a utility-based approach, while preserving their initial configurations as much as possible.

Result: The algorithm was proven to be complete and Pareto-optimal, with experimental results showing nominal planning times (milliseconds for 100 modules) and better performance compared to a market-based allocation algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm efficiently handles configuration formation tasks, making it superior in both performance and communication efficiency when compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: We consider the problem of configuration formation in modular robot systems
where a set of modules that are initially in different configurations and
located at different locations are required to assume appropriate positions so
that they can get into a new, user-specified, target configuration. We propose
a novel algorithm based on graph isomorphism, where the modules select
locations or spots in the target configuration using a utility-based framework,
while retaining their original configuration to the greatest extent possible,
to reduce the time and energy required by the modules to assume the target
configuration. We have shown analytically that our proposed algorithm is
complete and guarantees a Pareto-optimal allocation. Experimental simulations
of our algorithm with different number of modules in different initial
configurations and located initially at different locations, show that the
planning time of our algorithm is nominal (order of msec. for 100 modules). We
have also compared our algorithm against a market-based allocation algorithm
and shown that our proposed algorithm performs better in terms of time and
number of messages exchanged.

Result: The device successfully generated accurate contact, pressure, and dynamic stimuli on finger pads, validated via user perception studies.

Conclusion: FiDTouch enhances human-computer/robot interactions by enabling manipulation using precise haptic touch feedback.

Abstract: The applications of fingertip haptic devices have spread to various fields

user experiences, improving training outcomes, and new forms of interaction. In
this work, we present FiDTouch, a 3D wearable haptic device that delivers
cutaneous stimuli to the finger pad, such as contact, pressure, encounter, skin
stretch, and vibrotactile feedback. The application of a tiny inverted Delta
robot in the mechanism design allows providing accurate contact and fast
changing dynamic stimuli to the finger pad surface. The performance of the
developed display was evaluated in a two-stage user study of the perception of
static spatial contact stimuli and skin stretch stimuli generated on the finger

*Julio Garrido,Javier Vales,Diego Silva-Muñiz,Enrique Riveiro,Pablo López-Matencio,Josué Rivera-Andrade*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an unsupervised anomaly detection method for Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) using only motor torque data, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance safety and performance of CDPRs by detecting operational anomalies using just motor torque data, eliminating the need for additional external sensors.

Method: An adaptive, unsupervised algorithm using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for anomaly detection is proposed. This involves a calibration phase for model training, real-time evaluation using Mahalanobis distance, and regular parameter updates.

Result: The method achieved a 100% true positive rate, 95.4% true negative rate, and 1-second detection latency across 14 tests simulating variable wind conditions. It outperformed baseline methods in robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: The approach is viable for real-time anomaly detection in CDPRs using motor torque data alone, demonstrating adaptability to environmental variations and suitability for deployment in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load
manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At
each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the
cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by
detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or
cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using
only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,
unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a
brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on
known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using
Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds
triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the
latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.
Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind
intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%
average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative
evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates
higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

Result: Experimental results indicate improved performance during training and skill transferability to real surgical scenarios without assistance when using enhanced robotic aids.

Conclusion: The integration of robotic haptic assistance in surgical VR training enhances skill acquisition and enables better real-world application, suggesting its potential for improving clinical performance.

Abstract: The integration of high-level assistance algorithms in surgical robotics
training curricula may be beneficial in establishing a more comprehensive and
robust skillset for aspiring surgeons, improving their clinical performance as
a consequence. This work presents the development and validation of a
haptic-enhanced Virtual Reality simulator for surgical robotics training,
featuring 8 surgical tasks that the trainee can interact with thanks to the
embedded physics engine. This virtual simulated environment is augmented by the
introduction of high-level haptic interfaces for robotic assistance that aim at
re-directing the motion of the trainee's hands and wrists toward targets or
away from obstacles, and providing a quantitative performance score after the
execution of each training exercise.An experimental study shows that the
introduction of enhanced robotic assistance into a surgical robotics training
curriculum improves performance during the training process and, crucially,
promotes the transfer of the acquired skills to an unassisted surgical
scenario, like the clinical one.

Motivation: Traditional sensor networks face challenges in structural monitoring due to their static nature, motivating the exploration of robotic swarms for dynamic, distributed sensing applications.

Method: The authors employed high-fidelity simulations using Abaqus for finite element analysis and Webots for robotic dynamics. They used Gaussian process estimators for exploration and operational modal analysis to detect structural damages.

Result: Their analysis demonstrated that the robot swarm could effectively perform vibration-based structural inspections across different damage scenarios, varying in size, depth, and location.

Conclusion: The study validates the potential of miniaturized robot swarms as an effective solution for structural damage inspection, overcoming the limitations of static sensor networks.

Abstract: Robot swarms offer the potential to serve a variety of distributed sensing
applications. An interesting real-world application that stands to benefit
significantly from deployment of swarms is structural monitoring, where
traditional sensor networks face challenges in structural coverage due to their
static nature. This paper investigates the deployment of a swarm of
miniaturized vibration sensing robots to inspect and localize structural
damages on a surface section within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In
particular, we consider a 1 m x 1 m x 3 mm steel surface section and utilize
finite element analysis using Abaqus to obtain realistic structural vibration
data. The resulting vibration data is imported into the physics-based robotic
simulator Webots, where we simulate the dynamics of our surface inspecting
robot swarm. We employ (i) Gaussian process estimators to guide the robots'
exploration as they collect vibration samples across the surface and (ii)
operational modal analysis to detect structural damages by estimating and
comparing existing and intact structural vibration patterns. We analyze the
influence of exploration radii on estimation uncertainty and assess the
effectiveness of our method across 10 randomized scenarios, where the number,
locations, surface area, and depth of structural damages vary. Our simulation
studies validate the efficacy of our miniaturized robot swarm for
vibration-based structural inspection.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether large language models (LLMs) can classify and segment complex robot motions into primitive actions, specifically in fruit-picking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to simplify and improve the classification and segmentation of robot task motions using LLMs rather than traditional supervised or analytical methods.

Method: The study tests three fine-tuning approaches for LLMs using motion data captured from a UR10e robot during fruit-picking scenarios.

Result: All approaches were evaluated for their performance and applicability, showing promising results in task segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: LLMs can potentially outperform traditional methods for encoding robotic actions, making them viable for practical applications like fruit picking tasks.

Abstract: Despite their recent introduction to human society, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have significantly affected the way we tackle mental challenges in our
everyday lives. From optimizing our linguistic communication to assisting us in
making important decisions, LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are notably reducing our
cognitive load by gradually taking on an increasing share of our mental
activities. In the context of Learning by Demonstration (LbD), classifying and
segmenting complex motions into primitive actions, such as pushing, pulling,
twisting etc, is considered to be a key-step towards encoding a task. In this
work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to undertake this task,
considering a finite set of predefined primitive actions found in fruit picking
operations. By utilizing LLMs instead of simple supervised learning or analytic
methods, we aim at making the method easily applicable and deployable in a
real-life scenario. Three different fine-tuning approaches are investigated,
compared on datasets captured kinesthetically, using a UR10e robot, during a
fruit-picking scenario.

TL;DR: IRAF-SLAM enhances vSLAM performance under adverse illumination by dynamically adjusting image processing and feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vSLAM systems struggle under challenging conditions like dynamic lighting, low texture, and dynamic objects. Fixed front-end parameters make them vulnerable to sudden illumination changes.

Method: IRAF-SLAM incorporates three key innovations: image enhancement, adaptive feature extraction using entropy and gradients, and feature culling based on density analysis and lighting impact.

Result: Evaluations on TUM-VI and EuRoC datasets show improved trajectory accuracy and reduced tracking failures compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: IRAF-SLAM validates adaptive strategies in vSLAM, offering enhanced robustness to environmental variability without high computational costs.

Abstract: Robust Visual SLAM (vSLAM) is essential for autonomous systems operating in
real-world environments, where challenges such as dynamic objects, low texture,
and critically, varying illumination conditions often degrade performance.
Existing feature-based SLAM systems rely on fixed front-end parameters, making
them vulnerable to sudden lighting changes and unstable feature tracking. To
address these challenges, we propose ``IRAF-SLAM'', an Illumination-Robust and
Adaptive Feature-Culling front-end designed to enhance vSLAM resilience in
complex and challenging environments. Our approach introduces: (1) an image
enhancement scheme to preprocess and adjust image quality under varying
lighting conditions; (2) an adaptive feature extraction mechanism that
dynamically adjusts detection sensitivity based on image entropy, pixel
intensity, and gradient analysis; and (3) a feature culling strategy that
filters out unreliable feature points using density distribution analysis and a
lighting impact factor. Comprehensive evaluations on the TUM-VI and European
Robotics Challenge (EuRoC) datasets demonstrate that IRAF-SLAM significantly
reduces tracking failures and achieves superior trajectory accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art vSLAM methods under adverse illumination conditions. These
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive front-end strategies in
improving vSLAM robustness without incurring significant computational
overhead. The implementation of IRAF-SLAM is publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-robot collaborative system for Mandibular Angle Split Osteotomy (MASO), focusing on precise alignment, safety, and patient tracking using an optical tracking system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision and safety of Mandibular Angle Split Osteotomy (MASO), reducing reliance on the surgeon's experience while utilizing advancements in technology.

Method: The methodology includes task decomposition into positional control, orientation control, and force control, use of an optical tracking system (OTS) for tracking without a skull clamp, and novel registration and robot-OTS calibration methods.

Result: Drilling experiments on a realistic phantom model show an average error of 1.85mm between planned and actual drilling points.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates improved precision and safety for MASO, combining robotic control and surgeon guidance.

Abstract: Mandibular Angle Split Osteotomy (MASO) is a significant procedure in oral
and maxillofacial surgery. Despite advances in technique and instrumentation,
its success still relies heavily on the surgeon's experience. In this work, a
human-robot collaborative system is proposed to perform MASO according to a
preoperative plan and under guidance of a surgeon. A task decomposition
methodology is used to divide the collaborative surgical procedure into three
subtasks: (1) positional control and (2) orientation control, both led by the
robot for precise alignment; and (3) force-control, managed by surgeon to
ensure safety. Additionally, to achieve patient tracking without the need for a
skull clamp, an optical tracking system (OTS) is utilized. Movement of the
patient mandibular is measured with an optical-based tracker mounted on a

### [292] [Beyond Robustness: Learning Unknown Dynamic Load Adaptation for Quadruped Locomotion on Rough Terrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07825)
*Leixin Chang,Yuxuan Nai,Hua Chen,Liangjing Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses quadruped robots dealing with unknown dynamic loads, introducing a load characteristics modeling approach integrated with Reinforcement Learning to ensure stability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable quadruped robots to handle unknown dynamic loads effectively, given challenges such as load dynamics representation, capturing the dynamics without external sensors, and stabilizing interaction with the load.

Method: Proposing load characteristics modeling combined with RL-based locomotion control to infer load dynamics, stabilize interaction, and deploy in real-world scenarios.

Result: Extensive simulations show the method excels in sudden load resistance, load stabilization, and navigating rough terrain with heavy loads compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: The approach proves effective in improving quadruped robot performance under unknown dynamic loads, showcasing practicality and robustness in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Unknown dynamic load carrying is one important practical application for
quadruped robots. Such a problem is non-trivial, posing three major challenges
in quadruped locomotion control. First, how to model or represent the dynamics
of the load in a generic manner. Second, how to make the robot capture the
dynamics without any external sensing. Third, how to enable the robot to
interact with load handling the mutual effect and stabilizing the load. In this
work, we propose a general load modeling approach called load characteristics
modeling to capture the dynamics of the load. We integrate this proposed
modeling technique and leverage recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
based locomotion control to enable the robot to infer the dynamics of load
movement and interact with the load indirectly to stabilize it and realize the
sim-to-real deployment to verify its effectiveness in real scenarios. We
conduct extensive comparative simulation experiments to validate the
effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Results show that our
method outperforms other methods in sudden load resistance, load stabilizing
and locomotion with heavy load on rough terrain.

*David Warutumo,Ciira wa Maina*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper studies how sensory distortions affect autonomous representation learning in robotics using a simple simulated robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the impact of imperfect sensory information on representation learning and navigation in autonomous robotic systems.

Method: A two-wheeled robot with distance sensors and a compass was simulated in a simple square environment, analyzing its sensory data during random exploration.

Result: The study found that although sensory distortions led to a distorted perceptual space, structured representations correlating with the physical environment still emerged.

Conclusion: Autonomous robots can develop structured navigation strategies and spatial representations even with imperfect sensory inputs, contributing to insights in embodied cognition and minimal agency.

Abstract: Autonomous agents, particularly in the field of robotics, rely on sensory
information to perceive and navigate their environment. However, these sensory
inputs are often imperfect, leading to distortions in the agent's internal
representation of the world. This paper investigates the nature of these
perceptual distortions and how they influence autonomous representation
learning using a minimal robotic system. We utilize a simulated two-wheeled
robot equipped with distance sensors and a compass, operating within a simple
square environment. Through analysis of the robot's sensor data during random
exploration, we demonstrate how a distorted perceptual space emerges. Despite
these distortions, we identify emergent structures within the perceptual space
that correlate with the physical environment, revealing how the robot
autonomously learns a structured representation for navigation without explicit
spatial information. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied
cognition, minimal agency, and the role of perception in self-generated
navigation strategies in artificial life.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROS Help Desk aims to simplify debugging and error resolution in Robot Operating System (ROS) by providing user-friendly tools and proactive maintenance capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding and troubleshooting complex robotic systems by users lacking ROS expertise, leading to delays in maintenance and increased downtimes.

Method: Developed ROS Help Desk with intuitive error explanations, flexible debugging tools for various expertise levels, proactive error detection, and multimodal data integration across multiple sensors.

Result: Testing with artificially induced errors showed effective and accurate error diagnosis, reducing system downtime and enhancing usability.

Conclusion: ROS Help Desk enhances human-robot collaboration by empowering users to diagnose and resolve errors efficiently, promoting more reliable robotic systems.

Abstract: As the robotics systems increasingly integrate into daily life, from smart
home assistants to the new-wave of industrial automation systems (Industry
4.0), there's an increasing need to bridge the gap between complex robotic
systems and everyday users. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible
framework often utilised in writing robot software, providing tools and
libraries for building complex robotic systems. However, ROS's distributed
architecture and technical messaging system create barriers for understanding
robot status and diagnosing errors. This gap can lead to extended maintenance
downtimes, as users with limited ROS knowledge may struggle to quickly diagnose
and resolve system issues. Moreover, this deficit in expertise often delays
proactive maintenance and troubleshooting, further increasing the frequency and
duration of system interruptions. ROS Help Desk provides intuitive error
explanations and debugging support, dynamically customized to users of varying
expertise levels. It features user-centric debugging tools that simplify error
diagnosis, implements proactive error detection capabilities to reduce
downtime, and integrates multimodal data processing for comprehensive system
state understanding across multi-sensor data (e.g., lidar, RGB). Testing
qualitatively and quantitatively with artificially induced errors demonstrates
the system's ability to proactively and accurately diagnose problems,
ultimately reducing maintenance time and fostering more effective human-robot
collaboration.

### [295] [Improving AEBS Validation Through Objective Intervention Classification Leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07872)
*Daniel Betschinske,Steven Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rule-based method using the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to improve the classification of AEBS activations, aiming to reduce reliance on subjective human labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AEBS validation methods often rely on human labeling to differentiate between false positive and true positive activations, raising concerns of bias and inconsistency due to subjective assessments.

Method: The paper proposes a rule-based classification method based on the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to tackle challenges associated with scenario uncertainty and driver interventions in recorded data.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates strengths, limitations, and requirements for effective application, and suggests that combining it with human labeling enhances transparency and consistency in classification.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of rule-based approaches, like PDP, to complement traditional human labeling, contributing to more reliable AEBS validation frameworks and encouraging further refinement and expanded application.

Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires
accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP)
system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by
comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from
open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -
is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and
the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is
frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments
of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing
biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach
leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.
Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,
limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings
suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the
transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall
validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work
adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for
refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the
potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for
more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

*Wanjia Fu,Hongyu Li,Ivy X. He,Stefanie Tellex,Srinath Sridhar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniTac, a method enabling robots to localize touch without additional sensors, using only joint sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most commercial robots lack tactile sensors, making tasks requiring touch interaction difficult. The authors aim to address this limitation.

Method: UniTac adopts a data-driven approach that solely relies on proprioceptive joint sensors to achieve whole-body touch sensing.

Result: UniTac demonstrates effective contact localization on Franka (8.0 cm accuracy) and Spot (7.2 cm accuracy) while operating at high frequency without added sensors.

Conclusion: UniTac democratizes touch sensing for human-robot interaction by providing an accessible method that eliminates the need for specialized tactile hardware.

Abstract: Robots can better interact with humans and unstructured environments through
touch sensing. However, most commercial robots are not equipped with tactile
skins, making it challenging to achieve even basic touch-sensing functions,
such as contact localization. We present UniTac, a data-driven whole-body
touch-sensing approach that uses only proprioceptive joint sensors and does not
require the installation of additional sensors. Our approach enables a robot
equipped solely with joint sensors to localize contacts. Our goal is to
democratize touch sensing and provide an off-the-shelf tool for HRI researchers
to provide their robots with touch-sensing capabilities. We validate our
approach on two platforms: the Franka robot arm and the Spot quadruped. On
Franka, we can localize contact to within 8.0 centimeters, and on Spot, we can
localize to within 7.2 centimeters at around 2,000 Hz on an RTX 3090 GPU
without adding any additional sensors to the robot. Project website:

TL;DR: The paper introduces and validates a German-language dataset for sentiment analysis in developer forums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in sentiment analysis tools and datasets tailored for German-language developer communities.

Method: Developed a dataset of 5,949 German developer statements and annotated them with six basic emotions based on Shaver et al.'s emotion model, using a validated process involving multiple annotators.

Result: The annotated dataset demonstrated high interrater agreement and reliability, affirming its robustness for German-language sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: The new dataset addresses a significant gap, supporting sentiment analysis in German-speaking software engineering, with potential for further optimization and expanded use cases.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential technique for investigating the emotional
climate within developer teams, contributing to both team productivity and
project success. Existing sentiment analysis tools in software engineering
primarily rely on English or non-German gold-standard datasets. To address this
gap, our work introduces a German dataset of 5,949 unique developer statements,
extracted from the German developer forum Android-Hilfe.de. Each statement was
annotated with one of six basic emotions, based on the emotion model by Shaver
et al., by four German-speaking computer science students. Evaluation of the
annotation process showed high interrater agreement and reliability. These
results indicate that the dataset is sufficiently valid and robust to support
sentiment analysis in the German-speaking software engineering community.
Evaluation with existing German sentiment analysis tools confirms the lack of
domain-specific solutions for software engineering. We also discuss approaches
to optimize annotation and present further use cases for the dataset.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of deriving structured explainability requirements and generating explanations from user feedback by introducing an automated, tool-supported approach. It also evaluates this method using a curated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability is critical for enhancing transparency, trust, and compliance, but it's difficult to systematically convert user feedback into structured explainability requirements and explanations.

Method: The authors proposed and evaluated a tool-supported automated process using a dataset of 58 user reviews annotated with manually crafted requirements and explanations, created in collaboration with an industrial partner.

Result: The evaluation revealed that while AI-generated requirements often lacked relevance and correctness, the generated explanations were preferred for clarity and style, albeit still requiring human validation due to correctness issues.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a valuable automated approach for deriving explainability requirements and generating explanations, highlights areas for improvement, and shares a dataset to enable further research in this domain.

Abstract: Explainability has become a crucial non-functional requirement to enhance
transparency, build user trust, and ensure regulatory compliance. However,
translating explanation needs expressed in user feedback into structured
requirements and corresponding explanations remains challenging. While existing
methods can identify explanation-related concerns in user reviews, there is no
established approach for systematically deriving requirements and generating
aligned explanations. To contribute toward addressing this gap, we introduce a
tool-supported approach that automates this process. To evaluate its
effectiveness, we collaborated with an industrial automation manufacturer to
create a dataset of 58 user reviews, each annotated with manually crafted
explainability requirements and explanations. Our evaluation shows that while
AI-generated requirements often lack relevance and correctness compared to
human-created ones, the AI-generated explanations are frequently preferred for
their clarity and style. Nonetheless, correctness remains an issue,
highlighting the importance of human validation. This work contributes to the
advancement of explainability requirements in software systems by (1)
introducing an automated approach to derive requirements from user reviews and
generate corresponding explanations, (2) providing empirical insights into the
strengths and limitations of automatically generated artifacts, and (3)
releasing a curated dataset to support future research on the automatic
generation of explainability requirements.

*Jonathan Ullrich,Matthias Koch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores how developers use LLMs for code generation and find that requirements need manual decomposition for effective use in prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how developers currently use requirements when leveraging generative LLMs for code generation.

Method: Interviews with 18 practitioners from 14 companies, followed by proposing a theory about developer processes and artifacts used.

Result: Requirements are too abstract for direct use with LLMs and must be decomposed into tasks enriched with design and architectural details.

Conclusion: LLMs don't replace fundamental requirements engineering work, and their use requires thoughtful preparation of input prompts based on domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: With the advent of generative LLMs and their advanced code generation
capabilities, some people already envision the end of traditional software
engineering, as LLMs may be able to produce high-quality code based solely on
the requirements a domain expert feeds into the system. The feasibility of this
vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate
requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely
unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how
they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed
LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that
explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our
theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract
for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed
into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and
architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights
that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate
code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to
automating requirements-centric SE tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges posed by large language models (LLMs) in their uncertainty and uncontrollability, which hinder their trustworthy use in requirements engineering (RE).

Method: A systematic literature review using Kitchenham's and Petersen's protocols was conducted, involving six databases, 867 records screened, and 35 primary studies analyzed.

Result: A hybrid taxonomy was developed to connect technique-oriented patterns like 'few-shot' and 'Chain-of-Thought' to RE tasks such as elicitation and traceability. Research gaps and limitations were identified through mapping exercises.

Conclusion: The authors provide a step-by-step roadmap to transform ad-hoc PE attempts into reproducible and user-friendly workflows for RE practitioners, offering a structured pathway for future advancements.

Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of prompt
engineering (PE) techniques that can enhance various requirements engineering
(RE) tasks. However, current LLMs are often characterized by significant
uncertainty and a lack of controllability. This absence of clear guidance on
how to effectively prompt LLMs acts as a barrier to their trustworthy
implementation in the RE field. We present the first roadmap-oriented
systematic literature review of Prompt Engineering for RE (PE4RE). Following
Kitchenham's and Petersen's secondary-study protocol, we searched six digital
libraries, screened 867 records, and analyzed 35 primary studies. To bring
order to a fragmented landscape, we propose a hybrid taxonomy that links
technique-oriented patterns (e.g., few-shot, Chain-of-Thought) to task-oriented
RE roles (elicitation, validation, traceability). Two research questions, with
five sub-questions, map the tasks addressed, LLM families used, and prompt
types adopted, and expose current limitations and research gaps. Finally, we
outline a step-by-step roadmap showing how today's ad-hoc PE prototypes can
evolve into reproducible, practitioner-friendly workflows.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to automate requirements engineering (RE) processes in the space industry, showing promise in reducing effort and improving compliance for smaller organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and precision required for requirements engineering in the space industry make it challenging for smaller space organizations to extract actionable requirements from large, unstructured documents.

Method: The authors propose and test an AI-driven modular approach leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and large language models (LLMs) to preprocess mission documents, categorize them semantically, retrieve relevant information, and draft requirements.

Result: Initial tests on a real-world mission document showed that the approach can decrease manual effort, enhance the coverage of relevant requirements, and enable lightweight compliance alignment.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility and outlines a pathway for integrating AI into requirements engineering processes, aiming to lower entry barriers for smaller organizations in large-scale, safety-critical space missions.

Abstract: Requirements engineering (RE) in the space industry is inherently complex,
demanding high precision, alignment with rigorous standards, and adaptability
to mission-specific constraints. Smaller space organisations and new entrants
often struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured
documents such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory
standards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate
requirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven
approach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into
semantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content
from domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language
models (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the
space domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in
collaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our
preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort,
improve coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance
alignment. We outline a roadmap toward broader integration of AI in RE
workflows, intending to lower barriers for smaller organisations to participate
in large-scale, safety-critical missions.

*Gustavo Menesse,Ana P. Millán,Joaquín J. Torres*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model to explore higher-order interactions in the tripartite synapse and the role of astrocytes in modulating synaptic behavior to stabilize and expand stimulus-driven dynamics in simple neural circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to study the role of astrocytes in higher-order dynamics at synapses and reconcile their effects with traditional node-driven changes to better understand how circuits process information under the influence of different plasticity mechanisms.

Method: The authors introduce a higher-order model of the tripartite synapse, combining astrocyte gliotransmission with pre-synaptic facilitation mechanisms, and simulate its effects on a recurrent motif of three excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons under external stimulation.

Result: The study finds that higher-order astrocyte modulation enhances circuit stability and responsiveness to external input by expanding the range of parameters supporting stimulus-driven neural activity.

Conclusion: Higher-order interactions involving astrocytes can effectively reshape connectivity and improve information processing in neural circuits, demonstrating their importance even in minimal models.

Abstract: The dynamics of higher-order topological signals are increasingly recognized
as a key aspect of the activity of complex systems. A paradigmatic example are
synaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different
mechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms,
the role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the
so-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the
competition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have
yet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the
tripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in
short-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and
pre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability
of neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term
plasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a
minimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation
that propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit
is highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to
external input. By introducing higher-order interactions among different
synapses through astrocyte modulation, we show that higher-order modulation
robustly stabilizes circuit dynamics and expands the parameter space that
supports stimulus-driven activity. Our findings highlight a plausible mechanism
by which astrocytes can reshape effective connectivity and enhance information
processing through higher-order structural interactions -- even in the simplest
recurrent circuits.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online MicroStimulation Optimization (OMiSO), a framework for enhancing brain stimulation efficacy by optimizing stimulation parameters using pre-stimulation brain state information and adaptive updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision and efficacy of brain stimulation techniques for both scientific exploration and clinical treatments by incorporating neural state information into stimulation protocols.

Method: OMiSO uses pre-stimulation brain state data to select and refine stimulation parameters adaptively, ensuring they drive neural populations toward desired activity states. It involves intracortical electrical microstimulation experiments in a monkey.

Result: OMiSO outperformed existing methods that bypass pre-stimulation state information and do not adaptively refine stimulation, demonstrating superior accuracy in achieving targeted brain activity.

Conclusion: OMiSO represents a significant step forward for neuromodulation techniques, enhancing the ability to causally manipulate brain function, with applications in neuroscience research and brain disorder treatment.

Abstract: The coordinated activity of neural populations underlies myriad brain
functions. Manipulating this activity using brain stimulation techniques has
great potential for scientific and clinical applications, as it provides a tool
to causally influence brain function. The state of the brain affects how neural
populations respond to incoming sensory stimuli. Thus, taking into account
pre-stimulation neural population activity may be crucial to achieve a desired
causal manipulation using stimulation. In this work, we propose Online
MicroStimulation Optimization (OMiSO), a brain stimulation framework that
leverages brain state information to find stimulation parameters that can drive
neural population activity toward specified states. OMiSO includes two key
advances: i) it leverages the pre-stimulation brain state to choose optimal
stimulation parameters, and ii) it adaptively refines the choice of those
parameters by considering newly-observed stimulation responses. We tested OMiSO
by applying intracortical electrical microstimulation in a monkey and found
that it outperformed competing methods that do not incorporate these advances.
Taken together, OMiSO provides greater accuracy in achieving specified activity
states, thereby advancing neuromodulation technologies for understanding the
brain and for treating brain disorders.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper refines conformal prediction for classification tasks by incorporating information from multiple observations of a single instance, ensuring reduced-label sets and maintained coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance classification in citizen science contexts where multiple observations of the same instance, such as plant or animal images, are available.

Method: Developed an aggregation framework using conformal p-values from multiple inputs, leveraging their exact distribution with flexible scoring functions and refining classical strategies like majority voting.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated effective performance in reducing label set size and preserving coverage guarantees on simulated datasets and Pl@ntNet real-world data.

Conclusion: The framework provides efficient, statistically sound predictions for multi-input classification, with practical applications in areas like citizen science.

Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify
uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage
probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods
for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple
observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction
time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen
science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by
individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into
conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label
set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The
approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each
observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these
p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring
function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this
distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as
majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a
particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that
facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through
user-submitted images.

TL;DR: This paper explores using topological feature vectors derived from unreduced boundaries for machine learning pipelines and finds that models using unreduced persistence diagrams can rival or outperform those using reduced diagrams in certain tasks, with computational advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational cost and information loss concerns in deriving machine learning features from persistence diagrams, a typical task in topological data analysis.

Method: They introduce methods to generate topological feature vectors from unreduced boundary matrices and compare their performance on multiple datasets and tasks against reduced diagrams.

Result: Models trained on vectorizations of unreduced diagrams perform comparably or surpass pipelines based on fully-reduced diagrams for some tasks.

Conclusion: Utilizing features derived from unreduced boundary matrices can enhance computational efficiency and potentially improve task performance in machine learning pipelines leveraging topology-based features.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning pipelines trained on features derived from
persistent homology have been experimentally observed to ignore much of the
information contained in a persistence diagram. Computing persistence diagrams
is often the most computationally demanding step in such a pipeline, however.
To explore this, we introduce several methods to generate topological feature
vectors from unreduced boundary matrices. We compared the performance of
pipelines trained on vectorizations of unreduced PDs to vectorizations of
fully-reduced PDs across several data and task types. Our results indicate that
models trained on PDs built from unreduced diagrams can perform on par and even
outperform those trained on fully-reduced diagrams on some tasks. This
observation suggests that machine learning pipelines which incorporate
topology-based features may benefit in terms of computational cost and
performance by utilizing information contained in unreduced boundary matrices.

Motivation: To understand the double descent phenomenon in over-parameterized models using a Bayesian framework and reconcile it with traditional principles like Occam's razor.

Method: The authors analyze the risk characteristics of over-parameterized models and provide a Bayesian perspective on double descent, including its compatibility with Occam's razor. They use Bayesian model selection in neural networks as an illustrative example.

Result: The study demonstrates that double descent can naturally align with Bayesian principles and is not contradictory to the simplified model preference suggested by Occam's razor.

Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our
goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized
models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property
in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning
and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model
increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional
bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number
of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become
infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the
double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation.
Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor
that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when
possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model
selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.

*Joshua Murphy,Conor Rosato,Andrew Millard,Lee Devlin,Paul Horridge,Simon Maskell*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of second-order information, specifically the Hessian, to improve the Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance both accuracy in posterior approximation and computational efficiency when using Bayesian inference in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

Method: The paper integrates second-order proposals, incorporating gradient and curvature information (Hessian of the log-target), into the SMC$^2$ framework to improve posterior exploration and step-size selection.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic models demonstrate enhanced step-size selection and improved posterior approximation accuracy with second-order proposals compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The incorporation of second-order information within the SMC$^2$ framework provides better computational efficiency and improved posterior approximation accuracy, setting a novel direction for proposal design in Bayesian inference.

Abstract: When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation
and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential
Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing
(HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can
improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to
high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The
Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that
particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper,
we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the
Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored
previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the
first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals
not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature
(second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on
synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size
selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other
proposals.

*Haojie Liu,Zihan Lin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes a new Galerkin-ARIMA model replacing the AR part of ARIMA with spline-based functions to handle nonlinearity and improve forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARIMA models have limitations in handling nonlinear dependencies and struggle with high computational costs on large datasets, motivating the need for a flexible and efficient alternative.

Method: Replaces the AR component of ARIMA with a spline-based function using Galerkin projection and derives a closed-form OLS estimator for its coefficients.

Result: The resulting model is shown to be asymptotically unbiased, consistent, and offers better forecasting performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Galerkin-ARIMA bridges classical ARIMA with nonparametric regression, making it a powerful tool for modern time-series forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited
to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex
datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA
and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin
projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged
values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a
closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is
asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method
bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which
offering improved forecasting performance and computational efficiency.

### [310] [A Unified Empirical Risk Minimization Framework for Flexible N-Tuples Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07771)
*Shuying Huang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a general framework for N-tuples learning using pointwise unlabeled data to improve weakly-supervised learning, accompanied by theoretical foundations and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for N-tuples learning lack a unified theoretical foundation and often use task-specific designs. This paper aims to provide a general and theoretically-backed framework to improve learning performance.

Method: The paper unifies data generation processes under a shared probabilistic formulation, derives a generalized unbiased risk estimator, addresses overfitting using correction functions, and validates the framework with experiments.

Result: The framework consistently enhances generalization by integrating pointwise unlabeled data across diverse N-tuples learning scenarios, supported by experimental results and a generalization error bound.

Conclusion: Leveraging pointwise unlabeled data in N-tuples learning improves performance, offering a theoretically supported and flexible framework suitable for multiple weakly-supervised tasks.

Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning
has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing
N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order
comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on
task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,
we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk
minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to
enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation
processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic
formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk
estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We
further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To
demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four
representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case
of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from
negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical
risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data
consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.

*Yang Li,Yuchao Ma,Qi Qi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper introduces BundleNet, a neural network approach for optimizing joint online advertising mechanisms to enhance platform revenue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve allocation efficiency and revenue in online advertising by addressing the limitations of existing joint advertising mechanisms.

Method: They designed BundleNet, a bundle-based neural network tailored for optimizing joint advertising in single-slot and multi-slot settings.

Result: BundleNet approximates optimal mechanisms for the single-slot case and achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-slot settings, demonstrating increased platform revenue.

Conclusion: BundleNet offers a robust approach to joint advertising, balancing theoretical optimality and practical performance to benefit both platforms and advertisers.

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.
Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad
slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective
method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing
mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend
to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper
identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.
For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel
bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint
advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms
generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in
the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while
ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual
rationality.

*Nils Mandischer,Larissa Füller,Torsten Alles,Frank Flemisch,Lars Mikelsons*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses the concept of 'conjugated capabilities,' showing how interdependent abilities between humans and machines can be leveraged for task allocation, using evidence from post-rehabilitation data and an example application in manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance human-autonomy interaction by leveraging interrelated human and machine capabilities, addressing human limitations by redistributing efforts across conjugated capabilities.

Method: The researchers analyze interrelations among elementary human capabilities using IMBA standards, construct a network of these interrelations, and use examples from post-rehabilitation patient data to experiment with task optimization.

Result: A graph of conjugated capabilities was developed to demonstrate its potential in optimizing IMBA test design and task allocation between humans and autonomous systems.

Conclusion: Understanding and applying conjugated capabilities can improve human-autonomy collaboration by compensating for human limitations and optimizing task allocation.

Abstract: Human and automation capabilities are the foundation of every human-autonomy
interaction and interaction pattern. Therefore, machines need to understand the
capacity and performance of human doing, and adapt their own behavior,
accordingly. In this work, we address the concept of conjugated capabilities,
i.e. capabilities that are dependent or interrelated and between which effort
can be distributed. These may be used to overcome human limitations, by
shifting effort from a deficient to a conjugated capability with performative
resources. For example: A limited arm's reach may be compensated by tilting the
torso forward. We analyze the interrelation between elementary capabilities
within the IMBA standard to uncover potential conjugation, and show evidence in
data of post-rehabilitation patients. From the conjugated capabilities, within
the example application of stationary manufacturing, we create a network of
interrelations. With this graph, a manifold of potential uses is enabled. We
showcase the graph's usage in optimizing IMBA test design to accelerate data
recordings, and discuss implications of conjugated capabilities on task
allocation between the human and an autonomy.

*Line Abele,Gerrit Anders,Tolgahan Aydın,Jürgen Buder,Helen Fischer,Dominik Kimmel,Markus Huff*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of vision-language models (VLMs) to automate cataloguing in archives and museums, highlighting the need for human verification to ensure quality and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from the rapid growth of photographic collections, which manual cataloguing cannot keep up with, necessitating automated solutions like VLMs.

Method: The study evaluated AI-generated catalogue descriptions for archaeological photographs using the InternVL2 model, with assessments by experts and non-experts in a structured, experimental framework.

Result: Participants could classify AI versus human-generated descriptions better than chance, although OCR errors and hallucinations affected perceived quality. Descriptions rated as more accurate were harder to distinguish, underlining the need for human quality control.

Conclusion: AI can assist in cataloguing through draft generation but requires human oversight for specialized fields. Technical improvements and building professional trust will determine successful adoption.

Abstract: The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual
cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate
metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue
descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might
integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM
(InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on
labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and
archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental
framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or
expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI
tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups
underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors
and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in
accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review
is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions
generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like
archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools,
emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance.
These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft
generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment
with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful
integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such
as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among
professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and
explainable AI pipeline.

design of commercial AI-based public speaking training tools and to propose
guidelines for their improvement.
  Methods: The research involved 16 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus
groups with public speaking experts. Participants discussed their views on
current commercial tools, their potential integration into traditional
coaching, and suggestions for enhancing these systems.
  Results and Conclusions: Experts acknowledged the value of AI tools in
handling repetitive, technical aspects of training, allowing coaches to focus
on higher-level skills. However they found key issues in current tools,
emphasising the need for personalised, understandable, carefully selected
feedback and clear instructional design. Overall, they supported a hybrid model
combining traditional coaching with AI-supported exercises.

### [316] [Robust signal decompositions on the circle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07007)
*Aral Kose,Daniel Liberzon*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of breaking down piecewise constant functions on a circle into indicator functions of circular disks, enabling tasks like motion planning or obstacle avoidance. It focuses on robust, data-aligned decompositions and characterizes and computes them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid agents in tasks like motion planning and obstacle avoidance by estimating unknown landmarks based on proximity sensed on a circle.

Method: Introduces concepts of robustness and degrees of freedom to favor suitable decompositions. Characterizes robust decompositions and provides a procedure for identifying all possible solutions.

Result: Determines the existence of robust decompositions, computes their count, and derives bounds on decompositions with maximum degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: The paper provides a systematic framework to decompose functions into robust components, enabling landmark estimation and enhancing control tasks for agents.

Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing a piecewise constant function on the
circle into a sum of indicator functions of closed circular disks in the plane,
whose number and location are not a priori known. This represents a situation
where an agent moving on the circle is able to sense its proximity to some
landmarks, and the goal is to estimate the number of these landmarks and their
possible locations -- which can in turn enable control tasks such as motion
planning and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the exact values of the function at
its discontinuities (which correspond to disk boundaries for the individual
indicator functions) are not assumed to be known to the agent. We introduce
suitable notions of robustness and degrees of freedom to single out those
decompositions that are more desirable, or more likely, given this non-precise
data collected by the agent. We provide a characterization of robust
decompositions and give a procedure for generating all such decompositions.
When the given function admits a robust decomposition, we compute the number of
possible robust decompositions and derive bounds for the number of
decompositions maximizing the degrees of freedom.

TL;DR: This study analyzes the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic heavy ball (SHB) algorithms in convex and non-convex settings, offering refined results using discrete Gronwall's inequality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence rate of optimization algorithms (SGD and SHB) under different objective functions.

Method: The paper leverages discrete Gronwall's inequality to derive convergence results, avoiding traditional approaches like Robbins-Siegmund or martingale convergence theory.

Result: The study establishes various convergence rates for SGD and SHB under convex and non-convex objective conditions, offering probabilistic bounds and almost sure convergence results.

Conclusion: The results improve understanding of the theoretical guarantees for SGD and SHB, especially under specific parameter settings for step size and momentum.

Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence rate for the last iterate of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic heavy ball (SHB) in the parametric
setting when the objective function $F$ is globally convex or non-convex whose
gradient is $\gamma$-H\"{o}lder. Using only discrete Gronwall's inequality
without Robbins-Siegmund theorem nor martingale convergence theory, we recover
results for both SGD and SHB: $\min_{s\leq t} \|\nabla F(w_s)\|^2 = o(t^{p-1})$
for non-convex objectives and $F(w_t) - F_* = o(t^{2\gamma/(1+\gamma) \cdot
\max(p-1,-2p+1)-\epsilon})$ for $\beta \in (0, 1)$ and $\min_{s \leq t} F(w_s)
- F_* = o(t^{p-1})$ almost surely for convex objectives. In addition, we proved
that SHB with constant momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ attains a
convergence rate of $F(w_t) - F_* = O(t^{\max(p-1,-2p+1)} \log^2
\frac{t}{\delta})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ when $F$ is convex and
$\gamma = 1$ and step size $\alpha_t = \Theta(t^{-p})$ with $p \in
(\frac{1}{2}, 1)$.

Motivation: The study aims to identify the optimal RAG agent configuration for autonomous scientific discovery in astrophysics and create a scalable evaluation system for cosmology QA tasks.

Method: Nine RAG configurations were tested on 105 cosmology QA pairs, assessed manually by a human expert. Insights from this were used to calibrate an LLM-as-a-Judge system.

Result: The OpenAI embedding and generative model-based RAG configuration achieved the highest accuracy at 91.4%, and an LLMaaJ system was calibrated for scalable QA evaluation.

Conclusion: The findings facilitate choosing the best RAG setup for scientific discovery in astrophysics, provide tools for scalable QA system evaluation, and make new resources available to the astrophysics community.

Abstract: We evaluate 9 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent configurations on

purpose.The RAG configurations are manually evaluated by a human expert, that
is, a total of 945 generated answers were assessed. We find that currently the
best RAG agent configuration is with OpenAI embedding and generative model,
yielding 91.4\% accuracy. Using our human evaluation results we calibrate

evaluation. These results allow us to systematically select the best RAG agent
configuration for multi-agent system for autonomous scientific discovery in

with an LLMaaJ system that can be scaled to thousands of cosmology QA pairs. We

TL;DR: This study benchmarks machine learning models using longitudinal waitlist data to predict waitlist mortality for heart transplant patients, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current process for managing heart transplant waitlists is ad-hoc despite the availability of extensive data since 2018, creating a need for data-driven analytical tools to aid decision-making.

Method: The study trains time-dependent survival models using longitudinal data from 23,807 patients with 77 variables and evaluates 1-year survival prediction using metrics like C-Index and AUROC.

Result: The best model achieves a high performance, with a C-Index of 0.94 and an AUROC of 0.89, significantly surpassing previous models.

Conclusion: This research highlights the potential of machine learning to enhance urgency assessments and refine policies for heart transplant decision-making while identifying both established and novel risk factors.

Abstract: Decisions about managing patients on the heart transplant waitlist are
currently made by committees of doctors who consider multiple factors, but the
process remains largely ad-hoc. With the growing volume of longitudinal
patient, donor, and organ data collected by the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS) since 2018, there is increasing interest in analytical
approaches to support clinical decision-making at the time of organ
availability. In this study, we benchmark machine learning models that leverage
longitudinal waitlist history data for time-dependent, time-to-event modeling
of waitlist mortality. We train on 23,807 patient records with 77 variables and
evaluate both survival prediction and discrimination at a 1-year horizon. Our
best model achieves a C-Index of 0.94 and AUROC of 0.89, significantly
outperforming previous models. Key predictors align with known risk factors
while also revealing novel associations. Our findings can support urgency
assessment and policy refinement in heart transplant decision making.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces IML-Spikeformer, a novel spiking Transformer designed for energy-efficient large-scale speech processing, addressing challenges like training overhead and lack of tailored architectures, achieving competitive performance with reduced energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in large-scale speech tasks caused by computational overhead during training and the absence of specialized architectures.

Method: The authors propose IML-Spikeformer, which includes an Input-aware Multi-Level Spike mechanism for efficient simulation of spike firing and incorporates the HD-RepSSA module to enhance attention precision and model multi-scale temporal dependencies.

Result: The IML-Spikeformer achieves competitive word error rates (6.0% on AiShell-1 and 3.4% on Librispeech-960) compared to traditional ANN transformers, while significantly reducing energy consumption by 4.64× and 4.32×.

Conclusion: IML-Spikeformer represents a significant step forward in scalable SNN architectures for speech processing, providing both high task performance and superior energy efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms,
represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers
energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve
competitive performance on large-scale speech processing task. Two key
challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training
caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN
architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we
introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking
Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech
processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS)
mechanism, which simulate multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep
using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further
integrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a
Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module
enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale
temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that
IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on
Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing
theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$
respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures
for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how effectively target polytopes, particularly simplices, can be approximated using specific computational methods involving Minkowski sums and convex hulls.

Method: The authors analyze polytopes generated through Minkowski sums and convex hulls, focusing on their depth and the ability to approximate simplices.

Result: The study finds that simplices cannot be approximated beyond trivial cases and classifies them as the only 'outer additive' convex bodies.

Conclusion: Simplices are fundamentally resistant to meaningful approximation by the described methods, offering key insights into their computational representation and unique properties.

Abstract: We study approximations of polytopes in the standard model for computing
polytopes using Minkowski sums and (convex hulls of) unions. Specifically, we
study the ability to approximate a target polytope by polytopes of a given
depth. Our main results imply that simplices can only be ``trivially
approximated''. On the way, we obtain a characterization of simplices as the
only ``outer additive'' convex bodies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked structural complexity and emergent organization in multicomponent systems, which contrasts with simpler statistical mixtures.

Method: The authors compared multicomponent systems with statistical mixtures, analyzing their structural complexities and emergent hierarchical properties.

Result: It was demonstrated that multicomponent systems possess unique structural complexities and hierarchical organization, contrasting statistical mixture approaches.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a new perspective on structural complexity in multicomponent systems, suggesting broad implications for understanding system ergodicity.

Abstract: We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much
more structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely
more complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical
mixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent
hierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural
complexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad
consequences for system ergodicity.

Method: The study combines a fixed-bed reactor model, hybrid ANN surrogate modeling, NSGA-II optimization, and MCDM methods like TOPSIS and sPROBID.

Result: Achieved reduced simulation time (93.8%) with accurate predictions and optimized methane reforming outputs under three scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable and effectively balances conflicting objectives in catalytic reactor optimization.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated modeling and optimization framework for a
steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor, combining a mathematical model,
artificial neural network (ANN)-based hybrid modeling, advanced multi-objective
optimization (MOO) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A
one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model accounting for internal mass transfer
resistance was employed to simulate reactor performance. To reduce the high
computational cost of the mathematical model, a hybrid ANN surrogate was
constructed, achieving a 93.8% reduction in average simulation time while
maintaining high predictive accuracy. The hybrid model was then embedded into
three MOO scenarios using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
(NSGA-II) solver: 1) maximizing methane conversion and hydrogen output; 2)
maximizing hydrogen output while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions; and 3) a
combined three-objective case. The optimal trade-off solutions were further
ranked and selected using two MCDM methods: technique for order of preference
by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simplified preference ranking on
the basis of ideal-average distance (sPROBID). Optimal results include a
methane conversion of 0.863 with 4.556 mol/s hydrogen output in the first case,
and 0.988 methane conversion with 3.335 mol/s hydrogen and 0.781 mol/s carbon
dioxide in the third. This comprehensive methodology offers a scalable and
effective strategy for optimizing complex catalytic reactor systems with
multiple, often conflicting, objectives.

*Zelin Zhu,Kai Yang,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the integration of wireless localization and sensing technologies through a novel optimization algorithm, improving performance by leveraging high-dimensional CSI in MIMO-OFDM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization and sensing are pivotal for modern networks and intelligent applications, but joint modeling using high-dimensional CSI characteristics in MIMO-OFDM systems has been underexplored.

Method: The authors formulated localization and sensing as a mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and introduced a stochastic proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO) algorithm.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated SPG-MIBO’s computational efficiency and effectiveness in improving joint localization and sensing tasks.

Conclusion: Joint modeling and optimization through SPG-MIBO unlock significant performance improvements and computational efficiencies for localization and sensing tasks.

Abstract: Wireless localization and sensing technologies are essential in modern
wireless networks, supporting applications in smart cities, the Internet of
Things (IoT), and autonomous systems. High-performance localization and sensing
systems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent
applications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning
has recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the
spatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the
frequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of
localization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of
MIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to
jointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their
potential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a
mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic
proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO)
algorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale
datasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and
memory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence
guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its
effectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and
sensing optimization.

*Renyuan Liu,Yuyang Leng,Kaiyan Liu,Shaohan Hu,Chun-Fu,Chen,Peijun Zhao,Heechul Yun,Shuochao Yao*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: DAF introduces advanced system-level optimizations for on-device dynamic activation quantization, achieving significant memory savings and speedup without compromising training accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory constraints on mobile and edge devices hinder on-device training effectiveness, especially due to activation memory requirements in deep neural networks.

Method: DAF employs hybrid reduction operations, collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing, and importance-aware memory paging to optimize dynamic activation quantization for embedded/edge systems.

Result: Experimental evaluations achieve up to 22.9x memory reduction and 3.2x training speedup on deep learning models tested on mobile and embedded platforms.

Conclusion: DAF provides a scalable and practical solution for efficient on-device deep neural network training in memory-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in on-device training for deep neural networks have
underscored the critical need for efficient activation compression to overcome
the memory constraints of mobile and edge devices. As activations dominate
memory usage during training and are essential for gradient computation,
compressing them without compromising accuracy remains a key research
challenge. While existing methods for dynamic activation quantization promise
theoretical memory savings, their practical deployment is impeded by
system-level challenges such as computational overhead and memory
fragmentation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce DAF, a Dynamic Activation Framework
that enables scalable and efficient on-device training through system-level
optimizations. DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic
quantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid
reduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge
SoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic
quantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management
scheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.
  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory
savings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy. Evaluations
on various deep learning models across embedded and mobile platforms
demonstrate up to a $22.9\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $3.2\times$
speedup, making DAF a scalable and practical solution for resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Analyzes the impact of distributed and decentralized AI training on compute governance, emphasizing risks and benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the often misunderstood and conflated aspects of distributed and decentralized training in AI and their implications for policy and governance.

Method: Differentiates distributed and decentralized AI setups and discusses their implications for AI governance and policy levers.

Result: Highlights risks such as capability proliferation and reduction in detectability, alongside benefits like privacy-preservation and reduced power concentration.

Conclusion: Supports clearer policymaking to address challenges and opportunities in compute governance amid distributed/decentralized AI advancements.

Abstract: Advances in low-communication training algorithms are enabling a shift from
centralised model training to compute setups that are either distributed across
multiple clusters or decentralised via community-driven contributions. This
paper distinguishes these two scenarios - distributed and decentralised
training - which are little understood and often conflated in policy discourse.
We discuss how they could impact technical AI governance through an increased
risk of compute structuring, capability proliferation, and the erosion of
detectability and shutdownability. While these trends foreshadow a possible new
paradigm that could challenge key assumptions of compute governance, we
emphasise that certain policy levers, like export controls, remain relevant. We
also acknowledge potential benefits of decentralised AI, including
privacy-preserving training runs that could unlock access to more data, and
mitigating harmful power concentration. Our goal is to support more precise
policymaking around compute, capability proliferation, and decentralised AI
development.

Conclusion: Integrated machine learning approaches, combining LLMs and trained algorithms, can revolutionize research efficiency in complex scientific domains such as material chemistry and predictive modeling.

Abstract: New discoveries in chemistry and materials science, with increasingly
expanding volume of requisite knowledge and experimental workload, provide
unique opportunities for machine learning (ML) to take critical roles in
accelerating research efficiency. Here, we demonstrate (1) the use of large
language models (LLMs) for automated literature reviews, and (2) the training
of an ML model to predict chemical knowledge (thermodynamic parameters). Our
LLM-based literature review tool (LMExt) successfully extracted chemical
information and beyond into a machine-readable structure, including stability
constants for metal cation-ligand interactions, thermodynamic properties, and
other broader data types (medical research papers, and financial reports),
effectively overcoming the challenges inherent in each domain. Using the
autonomous acquisition of thermodynamic data, an ML model was trained using the
CatBoost algorithm for accurately predicting thermodynamic parameters (e.g.,
enthalpy of formation) of minerals. This work highlights the transformative
potential of integrated ML approaches to reshape chemistry and materials
science research.

*Muhammad Kazim,Harun Pirim,Chau Le,Trung Le,Om Prakash Yadav*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to improve predictive maintenance (PdM) and resilience-based clustering for power grid substations, demonstrating higher prediction accuracy and effective risk grouping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unplanned power outages cost the US economy approximately $150 billion annually, partly due to the limitations of existing PdM models that ignore spatial, temporal, and causal dependencies in grid system failures.

Method: The researchers developed a multilayer GNN framework combining Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks (temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), integrating them with attention-weighted embeddings. They analyzed seven years of data from Oklahoma Gas & Electric, comprising 292,830 records across 347 substations.

Result: The proposed model achieved a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935 ± 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost, Random Forest, and single-layer GNNs with notable margins. Removing the causal layer significantly reduced performance. For resilience purposes, HDBSCAN led to effective clustering, dividing substations into eight risk-based groups, with significant inter-cluster variation confirmed by ANOVA.

Conclusion: The proposed multilayer GNN framework not only enhances failure prediction accuracy but also provides robust tools for risk-aware substation clustering, outperforming both traditional machine learning models and alternative clustering methods using key metrics.

Abstract: Unplanned power outages cost the US economy over $150 billion annually,
partly due to predictive maintenance (PdM) models that overlook spatial,
temporal, and causal dependencies in grid failures. This study introduces a
multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to enhance PdM and enable
resilience-based substation clustering. Using seven years of incident data from
Oklahoma Gas & Electric (292,830 records across 347 substations), the framework
integrates Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks
(temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), fused through
attention-weighted embeddings. Our model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935
+/- 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest by 3.2% and 2.7%, and
single-layer GNNs by 10 to 15 percent. Removing the causal layer drops
performance to 0.7354 +/- 0.0418. For resilience analysis, HDBSCAN clustering
on HierarchicalRiskGNN embeddings identifies eight operational risk groups. The
highest-risk cluster (Cluster 5, 44 substations) shows 388.4 incidents/year and
602.6-minute recovery time, while low-risk groups report fewer than 62
incidents/year. ANOVA (p < 0.0001) confirms significant inter-cluster
separation. Our clustering outperforms K-Means and Spectral Clustering with a
Silhouette Score of 0.626 and Davies-Bouldin index of 0.527. This work supports
proactive grid management through improved failure prediction and risk-aware
substation clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expand FOA generative AI models to enable dynamic sound source generation in 3D spatial audio scenes.

Method: Developed an end-to-end AI model called SonicMotion in two variations, supported by a simulated spatial audio-caption dataset.

Result: SonicMotion models achieve state-of-the-art semantic alignment and audio quality while accurately capturing spatial attributes.

Conclusion: SonicMotion advances dynamic 3D spatial audio generation, offering precise sound localization and enhancing immersive experiences.

Abstract: Spatial audio is an integral part of immersive entertainment, such as VR/AR,
and has seen increasing popularity in cinema and music as well. The most common
format of spatial audio is described as first-order Ambisonics (FOA). We seek
to extend recent advancements in FOA generative AI models to enable the

TL;DR: This paper introduces an input-driven layer-dropping technique for speech and audio models, optimizing computational efficiency while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of adapting foundation speech models to edge and IoT settings with variable computational resources.

Method: Developed an input-driven layer-dropping strategy using input features and a lightweight layer-selection network to dynamically adjust processing layers.

Result: Validated the method on four public speech and audio benchmarks, showing significant improvements over random dropping and competitive results compared to early exit approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed input-driven layer-dropping approach effectively balances computational demands and performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Curating foundation speech models for edge and IoT settings, where
computational resources vary over time, requires dynamic architectures
featuring adaptable reduction strategies. One emerging approach is layer
dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone
network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows
transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches
exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly
modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven
$\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight
layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing
layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks,
using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach, thoroughly outperforming random dropping and
producing on-par (or better) results to early exit.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a "Re-Bottleneck" framework for modifying pre-trained neural audio autoencoders to optimize latent space structure for downstream tasks without sacrificing reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most neural audio codecs and autoencoders prioritize reconstruction fidelity, often ignoring the latent structure needed for downstream applications. This paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The authors introduce a "Re-Bottleneck," an inner bottleneck added to a pre-trained autoencoder and trained exclusively using latent space losses to define user-specific latent structures.

Result: Three experiments showcase the framework's effectiveness: (1) ordering latent channels while maintaining reconstruction quality, (2) aligning latents with semantic embeddings to optimize for diffusion models, and (3) enforcing equivariance between input transformations and latent space behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed Re-Bottleneck framework is a flexible, efficient post-hoc method for tailoring neural audio model representations for diverse applications with minimal retraining.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for
audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space
generation. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize
reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure
necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We
propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the
bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a
"Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space
losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent
channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents
with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion
modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation
on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the
latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and
efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them
to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal
additional training.

Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying high-performing ASR models on resource-constrained edge devices, where memory, compute, and power are limited.

Method: The paper evaluates 8 advanced PTQ methods on Whisper and Moonshine ASR models across 7 datasets, measuring accuracy, memory I/O, and bit operations.

Result: The study shows trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating successful 3-bit quantization with advanced PTQ techniques on high-capacity models.

Conclusion: Insights from the benchmark indicate effective strategies for optimizing ASR models for low-power, always-on edge devices, advancing the field of efficient speech recognition.

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have demonstrated
remarkable accuracy and robustness in diverse audio applications, such as live
transcription and voice command processing. However, deploying these models on
resource constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT device, wearables) still presents
substantial challenges due to strict limits on memory, compute and power.
Quantization, particularly Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), offers an
effective way to reduce model size and inference cost without retraining.
Despite its importance, the performance implications of various advanced
quantization methods and bit-width configurations on ASR models remain unclear.
In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark of eight state-of-the-art
(SOTA) PTQ methods applied to two leading edge-ASR model families, Whisper and
Moonshine. We systematically evaluate model performances (i.e., accuracy,
memory I/O and bit operations) across seven diverse datasets from the open ASR
leaderboard, analyzing the impact of quantization and various configurations on
both weights and activations. Built on an extension of the LLM compression
toolkit, our framework integrates edge-ASR models, diverse advanced
quantization algorithms, a unified calibration and evaluation data pipeline,
and detailed analysis tools. Our results characterize the trade-offs between
efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that even 3-bit quantization can succeed
on high capacity models when using advanced PTQ techniques. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing ASR models on low-power, always-on
edge devices.

Conclusion: The proposed solution simplifies quantum software development, lowers barriers for developers, improves execution speed, and increases the potential for working with more complex circuits.

Abstract: Quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically
transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. To realize
this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to
effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant
challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited

potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to
improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of
moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid solvers combining classical and quantum computing face challenges due to the lack of seamless integration frameworks.

Method: ProvideQ toolbox utilizes Meta-Solver strategies for problem decomposition, enabling interactive configuration and integration of classical and quantum techniques.

Result: ProvideQ demonstrates real-world applications and shows that quantum subroutines can be applied today, though current hardware limits competitiveness.

Conclusion: While the ProvideQ toolbox is functional and promising, advancements in quantum hardware are needed for competitive performance in hybrid optimization.

Abstract: Hybrid solvers for combinatorial optimization problems combine the advantages
of classical and quantum computing to overcome difficult computational
challenges. Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their
practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack
that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical
optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ
toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure
hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements
decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum
subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such
decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines
well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that
are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the
technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and
demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof
of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of
quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to
make their performance competitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust and accurate framework for extracting motion patterns and semantic information about crowds using mmWave radar, addressing challenges in noise filtering and complex crowd dynamics.

Method: The method involves creating mmWave flow fields via a hybrid signal processing pipeline, transforming these into directed geometric graphs, and employing Jacobian-related analyses like curl and divergence to identify crowd motion patterns and semantics.

Result: The framework effectively reconstructs flow structures with high fidelity, demonstrating strong spatial alignment, precise flow split characterization, and accurate detection of significant crowd motion semantics through curl and divergence analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows strong potential for crowd analytics by providing accurate, quantitative characterizations of motion and semantic insights into both structured and dispersed crowds using commodity mmWave radar.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd
motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our
proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts
from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to
generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations
of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these
fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow
currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is
quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian
and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd
semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on
crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity
mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the
underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating
strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow
split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key
crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift,
dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework,
underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for generating seamless panoramic images from multiple references, addressing limitations of traditional and generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image stitching methods struggle with parallax, lighting differences, and style variations, leading to flawed results.

Method: The authors fine-tune a diffusion-based inpainting model for panoramic image synthesis, ensuring scene content and layout fidelity across references.

Result: The proposed method generates high-quality panoramas by integrating content from multiple images and outperforms existing approaches on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Their method advances generative image stitching, providing seamless and coherent panoramas that overcome traditional limitations.

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple
reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting,
camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional
image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

*Wei Yao,Shuzhao Xie,Letian Li,Weixiang Zhang,Zhixin Lai,Shiqi Dai,Ke Zhang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SD-GS, a storage-efficient framework for dynamic scene reconstruction, resolving existing trade-offs in storage and motion complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D Gaussian frameworks struggle with balancing storage costs against their ability to handle complex physical motions, limiting their applicability.

Method: The paper proposes a deformable anchor grid for memory-efficient representation, combined with a deformation-aware densification strategy to model complex dynamic scenes effectively.

Result: SD-GS achieves a 60% reduction in model size and a 100% improvement in FPS, offering superior computational efficiency and visual quality.

Conclusion: SD-GS demonstrates its potential to revolutionize dynamic scene reconstruction by achieving high visual fidelity, significant storage reduction, and enhanced computational performance.

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

*Hannah Dröge,Janelle Pfeifer,Saskia Rabich,Markus Plack,Reinhard Klein,Matthias B. Hullin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper examines the challenges of applying image matting algorithms to capture stage content and offers insights, guidelines, and a practical pipeline for improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capture stage content presents unique challenges for image matting, which are not well-addressed by existing algorithms primarily designed for applications like teleconferencing and mobile entertainment.

Method: The authors provide a curated list of challenges in capture stage matting, offer guidelines for practitioners, and propose a custom pipeline adapted to these setups. This approach avoids needing extensive annotations and supports both offline and real-time applications.

Result: An efficient pipeline is demonstrated for adapting existing matting algorithms to address the peculiarities of capture stage setups. The authors use a diffusion model for validation, showcasing the effectiveness of their approach.

Conclusion: The paper offers actionable guidelines and an efficient pipeline to adapt matting algorithms for capture stages, providing measurable improvements in both real-time and offline settings.

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for
downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in
almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces RTR-GS, an inverse rendering framework enhancing relighting and BRDF decomposition, especially for reflective objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing challenges in rendering reflective objects and achieving better inverse rendering and relighting.

Method: They use a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer and deferred rendering for reflections. An additional physically-based deferred rendering branch refines decomposition.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting efficiency.

Conclusion: RTR-GS improves the handling of reflective objects, achieving robust decompositions and efficient processing in inverse rendering tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

### [342] [Learning Pole Structures of Hadronic States using Predictive Uncertainty Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07668)
*Felix Frohnert,Denny Lane B. Sombrillo,Evert van Nieuwenburg,Patrick Emonts*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning method to classify pole structures in $S$-matrix elements, achieving high validation accuracy while accounting for uncertainties, and validates its framework on synthetic and experimental hadronic spectroscopy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in identifying hadronic states are posed by ambiguous signals near thresholds and difficulties in mapping pole configurations to observable line shapes in scattering amplitudes.

Method: The authors employ an uncertainty-aware machine learning model using an ensemble of classifier chains to classify pole structures, with a rejection criterion based on predictive uncertainty.

Result: The presented method achieves nearly 95% validation accuracy while rejecting only high-uncertainty predictions. It generalizes well to experimental data, finding a four-pole structure for the $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and uncertainty-aware tool for analyzing pole structures in scattering amplitudes, with potential applicability to various hadronic spectroscopy problems.

Abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central
challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new
hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a
variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole
structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce
similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is
especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is
limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning
approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is
based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on
predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\%$ while
discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on
synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously
unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the
$P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole
structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the
presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While
evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to
other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure
inference in scattering amplitudes.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASE_Res_UNet, a new deep learning architecture, for segmenting challenging curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy. It outperforms existing models, particularly in noisy or low-contrast conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of segmenting curvilinear structures in noisy and dense biological microscopy images, where traditional methods and existing deep learning models struggle in accuracy and robustness.

Method: Developed two synthetic datasets mimicking real microscopy images with noise and varying intensities. Designed ASE_Res_UNet, which combines residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanisms in the decoder.

Result: ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed standard U-Net, ASE_UNet, Res_UNet, and other state-of-the-art methods in segmenting noisy and low-intensity structures. It also generalized well to real microscopy images and other curvilinear biomedical structures.

Conclusion: The proposed ASE_Res_UNet shows strong potential for biomedical image segmentation tasks, particularly in challenging and low-contrast conditions, enhancing applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a
challenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament
networks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original
datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled
microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely
mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset
presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence
intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning
has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often
declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we
developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation
Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by
integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms
in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and
quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,
namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,
particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,
were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We
further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and
found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.
Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained
microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it
successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or
low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for
applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

*Francesca Mignacco,Francesco Mori*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: This paper presents a theoretical framework combining statistical physics and control theory to determine optimal learning strategies for neural networks, addressing challenges like meta-parameter evolution and high-dimensional learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of theoretical understanding of optimal learning strategies in artificial neural networks and biological learning, particularly in high-dimensional and dynamically changing environments.

Method: The researchers combine statistical physics and control theory to derive low-dimensional representations of learning dynamics using closed-form ordinary differential equations. They frame the design of learning protocols as an optimal control problem aiming to minimize generalization error.

Result: The study identifies interpretable yet nontrivial optimal strategies for scenarios like curricula design, adaptive regularization, and noise scheduling. These strategies mediate trade-offs such as enhancing alignment with informative inputs while reducing noise fitting.

Conclusion: This unified framework provides foundational insights for designing optimal learning protocols and opens avenues for developing a meta-learning theory grounded in statistical physics.

Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected
decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural
networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners
can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal
learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay
between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search
for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the
learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to
interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine
statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to
identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the
high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations
that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order
parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control
problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of
minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework
encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and
control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal
curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising
autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how
optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing
alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.
Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results
establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal
learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded
in statistical physics.

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper introduces Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), a novel method leveraging autoregressive neural networks for solving mixed-integer nonlinear portfolio optimization problems under real-world constraints. VNA exhibits comparable performance to state-of-the-art optimizers and faster convergence on challenging instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mixed-integer optimizers struggle to solve portfolio optimization problems under constraints like turnover limits and transaction costs. The paper aims to address this challenge.

Method: The authors map portfolio optimization onto a classical Ising-like Hamiltonian and solve it using Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), which is based on autoregressive neural networks.

Result: VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios with over 2,000 assets and matches the performance of modern optimizers like Mosek while converging faster on difficult cases.

Conclusion: VNA is an effective algorithm for portfolio optimization, showing universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling, validated through analysis of major indices like S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in
financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints
such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a
mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often
struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like
Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its
classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We
demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios
comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence
on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis
applied to the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing
universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm
on portfolio optimization problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA) to optimize large-scale spin-glass problems faster, outperforming current quantum-inspired methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework that extends optimization capabilities in probabilistic and Ising machines, overcoming limitations of prior work in solving complex optimization problems.

Method: The authors propose PAOA, which iteratively modifies couplings in a network of binary stochastic units via parameterized updates. They implement it on FPGA hardware for annealing, demonstrating its foundation in a gradient-based variational formulation.

Result: PAOA outperforms QAOA in solving the 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and improves simulated annealing (SA) by optimizing multiple temperature profiles.

Conclusion: PAOA provides a robust extension of simulated annealing, achieving superior results in heavy-tailed problems and advancing the utility of Ising machines for complex optimization tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends
and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling
parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic
computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of
binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples.
We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the
gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a
principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting
case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an
FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D
spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior
performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing
by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance
over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.

Motivation: To improve the sensitivity and specificity of biomolecule detection without requiring probes or labels, particularly for neurotransmitters relevant to biomedical diagnostics and neuroscience.

Method: The study combines aluminum concave nanocubes (AlCNCs) to enhance fluorescence signals with machine learning algorithms, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for analyzing time-dependent data.

Result: Using AlCNCs, fluorescence intensity was enhanced up to 12-fold for specific neurotransmitters, and LSTM achieved classification accuracy exceeding 89%, outperforming k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively demonstrates the potential of combining advanced plasmonic nanomaterials and ML for high-precision biomolecule profiling, with transformative applications in diagnostics and neuroscience.

Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid approach integrating advanced plasmonic
nanomaterials and machine learning (ML) for high-precision biomolecule
detection. We leverage aluminum concave nanocubes (AlCNCs) as an innovative
plasmonic substrate to enhance the native fluorescence of neurotransmitters,
including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid (DOPAC). AlCNCs amplify weak fluorescence signals, enabling probe-free,
label-free detection and differentiation of these molecules with great
sensitivity and specificity. To further improve classification accuracy, we
employ ML algorithms, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks playing a
central role in analyzing time-dependent fluorescence data. Comparative
evaluations with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) demonstrate
the superior performance of LSTM in distinguishing neurotransmitters. The
results reveal that AlCNC substrates provide up to a 12-fold enhancement in
fluorescence intensity for DA, 9-fold for NE, and 7-fold for DOPAC compared to
silicon substrates. At the same time, ML algorithms achieve classification
accuracy exceeding 89%. This interdisciplinary methodology bridges the gap
between nanotechnology and ML, showcasing the synergistic potential of
AlCNC-enhanced native fluorescence and ML in biosensing. The framework paves

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper presents MODA, a diffusion framework unifying multiple 3D molecular design tasks with superior performance across various metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular generation approaches suffer from fragmentation, limited task flexibility, and low stereochemical fidelity, motivating a unified and efficient solution.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-task Bayesian mask scheduler for training a universal diffusion model, enabling shared geometric and chemical learning across tasks.

Result: MODA surpasses existing models in multi-task benchmarks, ensuring better ligand-protein interaction, substructure alignment, and zero-shot design efficacy without additional refinement.

Conclusion: A unified single-stage, multi-task diffusion framework like MODA can streamline and improve structure-based molecular design, outperforming conventional two-stage approaches.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now
reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks.
SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and
one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment,
and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies
fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration
with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment
is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared
geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a
universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training
paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry.
Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while
maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but
trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and
lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high
improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate
that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage
workflows for structure-based molecular design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular embeddings are limited to specific tasks and fail to capture diverse gene functions, motivating the development of a task-agnostic, integrative model.

Method: The researchers used an adjusted Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) to analyze embeddings from multiple data modalities, then developed PRISME, an autoencoder-based model for embedding integration.

Result: Results showed embeddings from different sources had non-overlapping molecular signals, and PRISME outperformed individual approaches in benchmark tasks, such as missing value imputation.

Conclusion: PRISME provides a robust framework for integrating multimodal molecular embeddings, offering improved performance and broader applicability for biomedical machine learning.

Abstract: Existing machine learning methods for molecular (e.g., gene) embeddings are
restricted to specific tasks or data modalities, limiting their effectiveness
within narrow domains. As a result, they fail to capture the full breadth of
gene functions and interactions across diverse biological contexts. In this
study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of
biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner
spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data,
literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To
distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we
devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis
(SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different
data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings
capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of
embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for
Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a
machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these
heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated
this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated
consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in
missing value imputations. This new framework supports comprehensive modeling
of biomolecules, advancing the development of robust, broadly applicable
multimodal embeddings optimized for downstream biomedical machine learning
applications.

### [350] [A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251)
*Aaron Goldstein,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to improve personalized movie recommendations by combining traditional algorithms with user input processed by Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation systems fail to incorporate detailed, textual user preferences effectively. This research seeks to address this gap, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The framework improves recommendations by first generating initial outputs via SVD or SVD++ algorithms, then refining these results using text-based user preferences through LLMs. Evaluations were performed using MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset and various metrics such as hit rates and NDCG.

Result: The LLM-enhanced framework achieved significant performance improvements (e.g., ~6x cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x NDCG) compared to SVD and SVD++, although with slightly higher computational overhead.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into traditional algorithms enables more personalized and effective recommendations, demonstrating new possibilities for movie recommendation systems.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-step late fusion framework for multi-task learning using semiparametric models, focusing on heterogeneous data integration while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve parameter estimation by integrating data from diverse and heterogeneous sources such as electronic health records or clinical trial data.

Method: The framework involves two steps: initial double machine-learning estimators for each task and adaptive aggregation of these estimators to leverage task similarities without sharing individual-level data.

Result: The proposed framework achieves faster convergence rates in theoretical guarantees, demonstrates robust performance in simulations, and works effectively in real data applications with moderate sample sizes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates information across heterogeneous data sets, maintains privacy, and enhances parameter estimation, making it reliable for multi-task learning with shared similarities.

Abstract: In the age of large and heterogeneous datasets, the integration of
information from diverse sources is essential to improve parameter estimation.
Multi-task learning offers a powerful approach by enabling simultaneous
learning across related tasks. In this work, we introduce a late fusion
framework for multi-task learning with semiparametric models that involve
infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, focusing on applications such as
heterogeneous treatment effect estimation across multiple data sources,
including electronic health records from different hospitals or clinical trial
data. Our framework is two-step: first, initial double machine-learning
estimators are obtained through individual task learning; second, these
estimators are adaptively aggregated to exploit task similarities while
remaining robust to task-specific differences. In particular, the framework
avoids individual level data sharing, preserving privacy. Additionally, we
propose a novel multi-task learning method for nuisance parameter estimation,
which further enhances parameter estimation when nuisance parameters exhibit
similarity across tasks. We establish theoretical guarantees for the method,
demonstrating faster convergence rates compared to individual task learning
when tasks share similar parametric components. Extensive simulations and real
data applications complement the theoretical findings of our work while
highlight the effectiveness of our framework even in moderate sample sizes.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) like Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) for financial forecasting and finds significant improvements in sample efficiency, but traditional models remain competitive in some tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial forecasting is challenging due to nonlinearities, temporal dependencies, and limited data, especially for low-frequency or emerging assets. The study aims to assess the viability of TSFMs in overcoming these issues.

Method: The study evaluates two TSFMs, TTM and Chronos, across three forecasting tasks, comparing pretrained and untrained versions while analyzing performance improvements, fine-tuning efficiency, and zero-shot capabilities.

Result: TTM showed strong transferability, yielding up to 50% better performance on limited data and improved zero-shot benchmarks. However, traditional models outperformed in two of the three tasks, showing TSFMs' limitations in task-specific optimisation.

Conclusion: TSFMs like TTM demonstrate promise in improving efficiency and handling data-constrained tasks, but domain-specific refinements are essential to match or surpass traditional models for financial forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to
complex nonlinear relationships, temporal dependencies, variable
interdependencies and limited data availability, particularly for tasks
involving low-frequency data, newly listed instruments, or emerging market
assets. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution
through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific
adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos)
across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes,
EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM
exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version
of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained
version achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and
15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's
zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting
and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can
surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model
consistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable
performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant
sample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines,
traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of
three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific
optimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer
substantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy,
data-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires
domain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial
time series characteristics.

### [353] [Feature-free regression kriging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07382)
*Peng Luo,Yilong Wu,Yongze Song*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The study introduces the Feature-Free Regression Kriging (FFRK) method for spatial interpolation, leveraging geospatial features instead of external explanatory variables and surpassing existing techniques in accuracy and generalization when tested on three heavy metals in an Australian mining area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of spatial interpolation of geographic variables, particularly the limitations posed by spatial stationarity and dependency on high-quality external explanatory variables when modeling trends.

Method: The authors propose FFRK, a method that extracts geospatial features like local dependence, local heterogeneity, and geosimilarity to construct a regression-based trend surface without employing external explanatory variables, and compare its effectiveness with 17 interpolation methods through experiments.

Result: The FFRK method consistently outperforms conventional Kriging approaches and machine learning models that rely on explanatory variables, effectively handling spatial nonstationarity and reducing dependence on external datasets.

Conclusion: Accurately extracting geospatial features can significantly improve spatial prediction performance more than simply adopting advanced statistical models, offering practical advantages in scenarios lacking explanatory variables.

Abstract: Spatial interpolation is a crucial task in geography. As perhaps the most
widely used interpolation methods, geostatistical models -- such as Ordinary
Kriging (OK) -- assume spatial stationarity, which makes it difficult to
capture the nonstationary characteristics of geographic variables. A common
solution is trend surface modeling (e.g., Regression Kriging, RK), which relies
on external explanatory variables to model the trend and then applies
geostatistical interpolation to the residuals. However, this approach requires
high-quality and readily available explanatory variables, which are often
lacking in many spatial interpolation scenarios -- such as estimating heavy
metal concentrations underground. This study proposes a Feature-Free Regression
Kriging (FFRK) method, which automatically extracts geospatial features --
including local dependence, local heterogeneity, and geosimilarity -- to
construct a regression-based trend surface without requiring external
explanatory variables. We conducted experiments on the spatial distribution
prediction of three heavy metals in a mining area in Australia. In comparison
with 17 classical interpolation methods, the results indicate that FFRK, which
does not incorporate any explanatory variables and relies solely on extracted
geospatial features, consistently outperforms both conventional Kriging
techniques and machine learning models that depend on explanatory variables.
This approach effectively addresses spatial nonstationarity while reducing the
cost of acquiring explanatory variables, improving both prediction accuracy and
generalization ability. This finding suggests that an accurate characterization
of geospatial features based on domain knowledge can significantly enhance
spatial prediction performance -- potentially yielding greater improvements
than merely adopting more advanced statistical models.

*Xinglong Liang,Jiaju Huang,Luyi Han,Tianyu Zhang,Xin Wang,Yuan Gao,Chunyao Lu,Lishan Cai,Tao Tan,Ritse Mann*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DpDNet, a specialized segmentation network for PET-CT cancer lesions that incorporates both cancer-specific features and shared knowledge, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation approaches for PET-CT lesion detection often treat all cancer types as a single task, ignoring their unique characteristics such as metastasis patterns and FDG uptake variations.

Method: DpDNet leverages Dual-Prompt-Driven mechanisms: specific prompts capture unique cancer characteristics, while common prompts retain shared knowledge. Prompt-aware heads are also implemented after decoding to handle multiple segmentation tasks.

Result: In experiments on a PET-CT dataset with four cancer types, DpDNet outperformed state-of-the-art segmentation models.

Conclusion: DpDNet enhances cancer lesion segmentation accuracy and enables the calculation of prognostic metrics like MTV, TLG, and SUVmax, demonstrating its utility in breast cancer survival analysis for personalized risk stratification and treatment optimization.

Abstract: PET-CT lesion segmentation is challenging due to noise sensitivity, small and
variable lesion morphology, and interference from physiological high-metabolic
signals. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network
solving the segmentation of multiple cancer lesions by treating all cancers as
a single task. However, this overlooks the unique characteristics of different
cancer types. Considering the specificity and similarity of different cancers
in terms of metastatic patterns, organ preferences, and FDG uptake intensity,
we propose DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network that incorporates specific
prompts to capture cancer-specific features and common prompts to retain shared
knowledge. Additionally, to mitigate information forgetting caused by the early
introduction of prompts, prompt-aware heads are employed after the decoder to
adaptively handle multiple segmentation tasks. Experiments on a PET-CT dataset
with four cancer types show that DpDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models.
Finally, based on the segmentation results, we calculated MTV, TLG, and SUVmax
for breast cancer survival analysis. The results suggest that DpDNet has the
potential to serve as a valuable tool for personalized risk stratification,
supporting clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies and improving
outcomes. Code is available at https://github.com/XinglongLiang08/DpDNet.

*Marie-Christine Pali,Christina Schwaiger,Malik Galijasevic,Valentin K. Ladenhauf,Stephanie Mangesius,Elke R. Gizewski*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning method using multi-sequence MRI data for carotid artery and plaque segmentation, addressing challenges related to plaque morphology and limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Carotid artery analysis in MRI is critical for understanding atherosclerosis risk but is hindered by plaque complexity and insufficient labeled datasets.

Method: The approach leverages a two-stage network: a coarse localization model guided by prior knowledge and a fine segmentation model combined with multi-sequence MRI fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning.

Result: The study demonstrated effective carotid artery segmentation and highlighted the significance of fusion strategies through experiments on data from 52 patients.

Conclusion: Fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning enhance segmentation accuracy in data-scarce MRI settings, showcasing their potential for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

*Bardia Hejazi,Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates deep learning-based compression algorithms for industrial XCT data, focusing on quality metrics and image decoding analysis using two different architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of imaging data necessitates efficient storage solutions without compromising recovered data quality.

Method: Two deep learning architectures, D-CNN and VQ-VAE, were applied to compress XCT data of a complex sandstone sample. Data recovery quality was assessed with conventional metrics and a newly introduced edge-preservation-sensitive metric.

Result: Results highlighted that varying architectures and compression rates impact quality differently, and edge preservation is crucial for certain analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into optimizing compression techniques based on specific preservation needs, aiding scientists in managing their data storage and analysis strategies effectively.

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

### [357] [Compressive Imaging Reconstruction via Tensor Decomposed Multi-Resolution Grid Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07707)
*Zhenyu Jin,Yisi Luo,Xile Zhao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GridTD, a novel framework for compressive imaging reconstruction leveraging tensor decomposition and multi-resolution hash grid encoding to achieve efficient and accurate image recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised techniques for compressive imaging reconstruction struggle to balance representation ability and efficiency.

Method: GridTD integrates a lightweight neural network with tensor decomposition, using multi-resolution hash grid encoding to optimize representation and reconstruction of high-dimensional images.

Result: GridTD exhibits theoretical advantages in terms of Lipschitz properties, generalization error bounds, and convergence stability. It outperforms existing methods in experiments across various compressive imaging tasks.

Conclusion: GridTD establishes itself as a versatile and state-of-the-art method for compressive imaging reconstruction, offering enhanced efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

*Haoyu Pan,Hongxin Lin,Zetian Feng,Chuxuan Lin,Junyang Mo,Chu Zhang,Zijian Wu,Yi Wang,Qingqing Zheng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for generating synthetic breast ultrasound images for overcoming limitations due to lack of annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expert-annotated data for breast ultrasound image analysis is limited, which restricts the development of deep learning models.

Method: Clinical descriptions and structural masks are used to synthesize BUS images with controlled tumor characteristics. A semantic-curvature mask generator ensures morphological diversity based on clinical priors.

Result: Generated synthetic images improve diagnostic tasks based on evaluations across six datasets. Visual Turing tests confirm the realism of these images.

Conclusion: The synthetic image generation framework shows promise in improving clinical applications and breast cancer diagnosis processes.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

*Hasaan Maqsood,Saif Ur Rehman Khan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning framework to enhance recurrence prediction in clear cell renal cell carcinoma by integrating multimodal data sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of accurately predicting ccRCC recurrence due to its molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity.

Method: The framework integrates CT, MRI, histopathology, clinical, and genomic data using domain-specific deep learning models and a fusion strategy.

Result: The use of multimodal models improves predictive accuracy and supports inference in cases of missing data modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances clinical decision-making by tackling the limitations of single-modality prognostic models and addressing data completeness issues.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Cerebrovascular pathology is crucial for understanding cognitive decline. Existing tools for analyzing 3D Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) lack precision. The paper introduces ArteryX, a MATLAB-based toolbox, to efficiently quantify arterial features, demonstrating better sensitivity and standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for improved tools to assess cerebral vascular integrity for early detection of neurological disorders and subtle vascular changes, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Method: ArteryX is a MATLAB toolbox utilizing a vessel-fused network landmarking approach to quantify vascular features. It integrates in-vivo artery simulation for feature validations at high accuracy and minimal user intervention.

Result: Validation showed ArteryX's superior sensitivity to subtle vascular changes in subjects with cerebrovascular pathology compared to existing semi-automated methods.

Conclusion: ArteryX offers potential for standardized vascular assessments, early disease detection, and benchmarking across patient cohorts, advancing cerebrovascular pathology understanding and clinical integration.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.

*Youssef ElTantawy,Alexia Karantana,Xin Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses wrist bone segmentation challenges in X-ray images by using simulated X-ray images derived from CT volumes for training a deep learning model, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the difficulty of acquiring annotated datasets for wrist bone segmentation in X-ray images due to the complex anatomy and expertise required.

Method: The authors generated simulated X-ray images from CT volumes with labeled wrist bones and used these to train a deep learning model for segmentation.

Result: The method achieved Dice scores of 0.80 to 0.92 on simulated datasets and demonstrated qualitative superiority on real X-ray images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the annotation challenge, showing reliability in segmentation and making the trained model and simulation tools openly available for further research.

Abstract: Plain X-ray is one of the most common image modalities for clinical diagnosis
(e.g. bone fracture, pneumonia, cancer screening, etc.). X-ray image
segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems,
yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior
performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large
amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an
annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of
expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in
X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image.
To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of
simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with
their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for
wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated
using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores
ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different
view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray
images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The
trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research
purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled medical imaging datasets, due to privacy, cost, and rarity, motivates exploring label-efficient deep learning methods for realistic hospital workflows.

Method: The paper employs partial fine-tuning of the CLIP ViT-B/32 visual encoder and evaluates zero-shot and few-shot learning with 1–16 labeled examples per disease class on the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset.

Result: The adapted CLIP model shows over 20% improvement in mean AUC score compared to the zero-shot baseline, demonstrating effective few-shot learning for common and rare disease classifications.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable label-efficient approach for internal hospital workflows, combining pre-trained vision-language features with few labeled examples for medical image diagnosis.

Abstract: Modern deep learning implementations for medical imaging usually rely on
large labeled datasets. These datasets are often difficult to obtain due to
privacy concerns, high costs, and even scarcity of cases. In this paper, a
label-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks to
reflect real-world hospital scenarios. The experiments use the NIH Chest
X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via
partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot
and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests
demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively
adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\% improvement in
mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this
work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image
archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and
scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this

TL;DR: This study proposes IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO) to address memory, runtime, and optimization challenges in imaging systems, offering a scalable and practical improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies and mismatched objectives in current gradient-based methods for evaluating imaging systems and designing scalable, application-agnostic optical systems.

Method: Introduced IDEAL-IO, which decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating tasks to reduce resource usage and improve optimization.

Result: Compared to traditional IDEAL, IDEAL-IO achieves up to 6x reductions in runtime and memory use while supporting more complex density models, helping design better imaging systems.

Conclusion: IDEAL-IO provides a practical, scalable, and efficient method to optimize imaging systems using information-theoretic principles and achieves better designs than previous approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through
the information content of their measurements alone, enabling
application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding
challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed
to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL
across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage,
long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to
end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with
Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density
estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting
models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed
models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory
usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide
optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive
optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing
information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for
real-world imaging system design.

*Rami Darwish,Mahmoud Abdelsalam,Sajad Khorsandroo,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents FedP3E, a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework designed to address challenges of non-IID data and class imbalance in IoT malware detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The IoT ecosystems are increasingly vulnerable to malware attacks, and there is a need for a detection framework that is both privacy-preserving and adaptable to data heterogeneity.

Method: FedP3E uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to construct class-wise prototypes, perturbs these with Gaussian noise for privacy, shares them across clients, and supports local training with SMOTE-based data augmentation.

Result: FedP3E effectively enhances IoT malware detection under non-IID and imbalanced data conditions, proving its efficacy with evaluations on the N-BaIoT dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed FedP3E framework addresses statistical heterogeneity and class imbalance efficiently, offering an improvement in IoT malware detection without compromising data privacy.

Abstract: As IoT ecosystems continue to expand across critical sectors, they have
become prominent targets for increasingly sophisticated and large-scale malware
attacks. The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of
IoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both
privacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)
offers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without
exposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx
often fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and
non-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint
malware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E
(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports
indirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.
Each client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact
summaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to
clients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based
augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than
relying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables
clients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns
observed across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.
This targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity
with minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset
under realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates ML, DL, and optimized LLMs for phishing detection, noting tradeoffs in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to counter increasingly advanced phishing attacks with detection systems that are both accurate and computationally efficient.

Method: Different models (ML, DL, and quantized LLMs) were benchmarked using a curated phishing dataset, exploring accuracy, efficiency, adversarial robustness, and interpretability. Zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies were also analyzed.

Result: Optimized LLMs, while underperforming in raw accuracy compared to ML/DL, showed potential for detecting context-based phishing. Certain compact models achieved competitive accuracy with minimal VRAM, and LLMs demonstrated promise in real-time, interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: Optimized LLMs can play a significant role in phishing detection systems due to their cost-efficiency, contextual detection capability, and support for explainable AI.

Abstract: Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the
need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized
small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through
experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently
underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they
exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues.
We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies,
revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance
of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models
like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above
80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient
deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and
cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide
concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These
findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence
systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into
modern cybersecurity frameworks.

Motivation: To challenge the robustness of fine-tuning defenses against prompt injection attacks and assess their security claims in a whitebox context.

Method: Developed an attention-based attack algorithm to test the defenses SecAlign and StruQ, analyzing their vulnerability using optimization in a whitebox setting.

Result: The proposed attack achieved up to 70% success rates with modest token budget increases, revealing significant weaknesses in current defenses.

Conclusion: Current fine-tuning defenses against prompt injection attacks do not adequately ensure security in the whitebox setting, necessitating further research.

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release

*Mohammad F. Al-Hammouri,Yazan Otoum,Rasha Atwa,Amiya Nayak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS) combining traditional signature-based methods with GPT-2's semantic analysis capabilities, achieving enhanced detection accuracy and reduced false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, particularly in IoT environments, and traditional IDSs struggle with detecting new and evolving attacks.

Method: The approach integrates GPT-2 for semantic analysis with traditional signature-based methods in a hybrid IDS framework. Experimental tests were conducted on intrusion datasets to assess its effectiveness.

Result: The proposed model improved intrusion detection accuracy by 6.3%, reduced false positives by 9.0%, and operated almost in real-time.

Conclusion: Integrating large language models like GPT-2 with traditional IDS methods can enable more intelligent and adaptive cybersecurity defences for modern environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating
traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding
capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become
increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and
resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of
Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective
for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving
attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and
identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering
subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges
the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of
GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative
intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by
6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time
responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model
integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity
defences suited for modern connected environments.

### [369] [Mitigating Watermark Stealing Attacks in Generative Models via Multi-Key Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07871)
*Toluwani Aremu,Noor Hussein,Munachiso Nwadike,Samuele Poppi,Jie Zhang,Karthik Nandakumar,Neil Gong,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses watermark stealing attacks on GenAI content and proposes a multi-key extension solution to counteract these threats effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to protect GenAI content from watermark stealing attacks, which pose risks to the credibility of content provenance.

Method: The proposed solution introduces a multi-key extension approach that can be applied to watermarking methods post-hoc, treating the watermark as a black-box.

Result: Theoretical guarantees and empirical results confirm that the multi-key extension significantly reduces the effectiveness of watermark forging attacks across various datasets.

Conclusion: Mitigating watermark stealing attacks is crucial for safeguarding GenAI content, and the multi-key extension approach presented in this paper provides a robust solution both theoretically and practically.

Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the
provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded
in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret
watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing}
attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not}
generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to
falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless}
watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected
success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses
on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a
black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to
mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking
method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and
demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less
effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of
watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and
model this threat via security games.

*Youqian Zhang,Xinyu Ji,Zhihao Wang,Qinhong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates electromagnetic signal injection attacks inducing color artifacts on CMOS image sensors, affecting image-based systems' reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify vulnerabilities in image sensors critical to safety and security systems and assess susceptibility to physical-layer attacks.

Method: The researchers induced electromagnetic interference to create color artifacts on CMOS sensors and analyzed the impact on object detection models.

Result: Electromagnetic interference artifacts caused significant mispredictions in object detection models via propagation in image processing pipelines.

Conclusion: The study reveals vulnerabilities in the visual perception stack, emphasizing the need for stronger defenses against physical-layer attacks.

Abstract: Image sensors are integral to a wide range of safety- and security-critical
systems, including surveillance infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and
industrial automation. These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to
make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic
signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors,
allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering
conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented
attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced
in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic
interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on
state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts
propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant
mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored
vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more
robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.
