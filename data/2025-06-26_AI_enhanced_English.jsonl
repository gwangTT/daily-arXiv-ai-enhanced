Existing methods\ntypically aim to find an $\\epsilon$-$expectedly\\ feasible\\ stochastic\\ optimal$\nsolution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality\ngap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\\epsilon$. However, in many\npractical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty,\nrendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial\nviolations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods\nfor finding an $\\epsilon$-$surely\\ feasible\\ stochastic\\ optimal$\n($\\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically\nbounded by $\\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\\epsilon$.\nOur methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified\nvariance-reduced ASG scheme $only\\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty\nsubproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish\nfirst-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an\n$\\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle\ncomplexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an\n$\\epsilon$-SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our\nproposed methods to solve the sample average problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper develops stochastic first-order methods to address constraints in stochastic convex optimization, ensuring deterministic constraint satisfaction and expected optimality gap within a tolerance.", "motivation": "Existing optimization methods focus on solutions with expected (average) feasibility and optimality tolerances, which are inadequate in scenarios requiring near-certainty satisfaction of constraints.", "method": "The authors propose accelerated stochastic gradient schemes on quadratic penalty subproblems, ensuring deterministic bounds on constraint violations and expected optimality gaps.", "result": "They establish theoretical oracle complexity bounds for computing such robustly feasible solutions and extend their methods to sample average approximation problems.", "conclusion": "The methods improve constraint satisfaction in stochastic optimization scenarios while providing rigorous complexity guarantees, addressing practical shortcomings of prior approaches."}}
