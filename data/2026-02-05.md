### [1] [Knowledge Model Prompting Increases LLM Performance on Planning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03900)
*Erik Goh,John Kos,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework for improving reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving significant accuracy improvements in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the limitations of LLMs in reasoning and planning tasks and investigates whether the TMK framework, successful in educational domains, could address these deficiencies.

Method: The TMK framework was applied to a reasoning benchmark, PlanBench, with a focus on decomposing complex planning tasks in the Blocksworld domain using TMK-structured prompting.

Result: The study demonstrated that TMK prompting improves reasoning task accuracy dramatically, achieving up to 97.3% compared to 31.5% before, and helps LLMs adopt more formal reasoning approaches.

Conclusion: TMK framework effectively enhances reasoning in LLMs by providing structured and causal hierarchical decomposition, with broader implications for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) can struggle with reasoning ability and planning tasks. Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.

### [2] [Enhancing Mathematical Problem Solving in LLMs through Execution-Driven Reasoning Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03950)
*Aditya Basarkar,Benyamin Tabarsi,Tiffany Barnes,Dongkuan,Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method called Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC) for mathematical problem-solving, enhancing reasoning by refining programmatic reasoning processes and leveraging feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing LLM-based systems for mathematical reasoning, such as the inability to correct earlier errors and the distraction caused by programmatic context, while improving reliability and accuracy in symbolic reasoning.

Method: The authors propose IIPC, which iteratively refines reasoning chains by combining execution feedback with the Chain-of-thought approach inherent in the base LLM, ensuring contextual focus and improved reasoning quality.

Result: IIPC demonstrated superior performance on various reasoning benchmarks compared to other approaches using multiple base Large Language Models.

Conclusion: IIPC effectively addresses the challenges in mathematical reasoning for AI, providing a revisable and accurate reasoning framework, and its open-source implementation enables broad accessibility and future improvement.

Abstract: Mathematical problem solving is a fundamental benchmark for assessing the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence and a gateway to applications in education, science, and engineering where reliable symbolic reasoning is essential. Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.

### [3] [AgentArk: Distilling Multi-Agent Intelligence into a Single LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03955)
*Yinyi Luo,Yiqiao Jin,Weichen Yu,Mengqi Zhang,Srijan Kumar,Xiaoxiao Li,Weijie Xu,Xin Chen,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentArk, a framework distilling multi-agent dynamics into a single model, achieving computational efficiency and maintaining robust reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost and error propagation issues in deploying large language model multi-agent systems while preserving their advanced reasoning capabilities.

Method: AgentArk incorporates three hierarchical distillation strategies to transfer multi-agent system dynamics into a single agent: (1) reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning, (2) trajectory-based augmentation, and (3) process-aware distillation.

Result: Distilled models from AgentArk exhibit computational efficiency and strong reasoning performance, demonstrating robustness and generalization in diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AgentArk effectively combines the intelligence of multi-agent systems into single models, addressing efficiency and error propagation challenges while inspiring future multi-agent research.

Abstract: While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

### [4] [Active Epistemic Control for Query-Efficient Verified Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03974)
*Shuhui Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active Epistemic Control (AEC) is a planning method in interactive environments that effectively balances grounding facts and simulations under uncertainty, thereby reducing prediction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the challenge of planning in interactive environments under partial observability, where critical information may be missing or costly to obtain, and predictions can lead to errors.

Method: The method introduces Active Epistemic Control (AEC), which separates grounded facts and beliefs to enforce categorical feasibility checks and strategically decides when to query or simulate predicates based on uncertainty levels.

Result: Experiments demonstrate AEC's ability to outperform strong LLM-agent baselines with competitive success rates while requiring fewer replanning iterations.

Conclusion: AEC offers a systematic approach to minimize prediction errors and enhance efficiency in planning for interactive, partially observable environments.

Abstract: Planning in interactive environments is challenging under partial observability: task-critical preconditions (e.g., object locations or container states) may be unknown at decision time, yet grounding them through interaction is costly. Learned world models can cheaply predict missing facts, but prediction errors can silently induce infeasible commitments. We present \textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and an SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility check, so simulated beliefs affect efficiency but cannot directly certify feasibility. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.

### [5] [Adaptive Test-Time Compute Allocation via Learned Heuristics over Categorical Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03975)
*Shuhui Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to optimize verification processes in large language model reasoning by focusing on selective state-level verification, resulting in higher accuracy and reduced verification costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification in LLM reasoning is expensive and often inefficient due to redundant or unpromising intermediate steps. The paper aims to optimize verification efforts in a cost-constrained setting.

Method: The framework incorporates (i) deterministic gating through structured interfaces, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a mix of learned scoring strategies, and (iii) adaptive verifier allocation based on uncertainty.

Result: The method, applied to the MATH benchmark, shows superior accuracy compared to multiple baselines while reducing verification calls by 44%.

Conclusion: Selective verification at the state level can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning systems by prioritizing informative verifications and reducing costs.

Abstract: Test-time computation has become a primary driver of progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning, but it is increasingly bottlenecked by expensive verification. In many reasoning systems, a large fraction of verifier calls are spent on redundant or unpromising intermediate hypotheses. We study reasoning under a \emph{verification-cost-limited} setting and ask how verification effort should be allocated across intermediate states. We propose a state-level selective verification framework that combines (i) deterministic feasibility gating over a structured move interface, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a hybrid of learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (iii) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty. Unlike solution-level best-of-$N$ or uniform intermediate verification, our method distributes verification where it is most informative. On the \textsc{MATH} benchmark, our approach achieves higher accuracy than best-of-$N$, majority voting, and beam search while using 44\% fewer verifier calls.

### [6] [Monitorability as a Free Gift: How RLVR Spontaneously Aligns Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03978)
*Zidi Xiong,Shan Chen,Himabindu Lakkaraju*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how chain-of-thought (CoT) monitorability emerges in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) during Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), finding it to be strongly data-dependent and unrelated to reasoning performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate how monitorability—the faithfulness and informativeness of chain-of-thought traces—emerges as LRMs undergo RLVR training, particularly for safety purposes.

Method: The study systematically analyzes different model families and training domains, examines the role of data (e.g., diversity and instruction-following), performs mechanistic analyses of monitorability via distribution sharpening and attention patterns, and assesses training/evaluation dynamics with varying difficulty.

Result: Monitorability improvements are found to be highly data-dependent rather than universally occurring during RLVR. Gains are attributed to entropy reduction and increased attention to prompts but not enhanced causal reliance. Additionally, capability improvements do not directly correlate with transparency.

Conclusion: The emergence of monitorability during RLVR training is context-dependent, driven by factors such as data diversity, and is not tied to reasoning capability improvements. The findings clarify when and how monitorability gains can be expected.

Abstract: As Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are increasingly deployed, auditing their chain-of-thought (CoT) traces for safety becomes critical. Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a "free gift" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.

### [7] [When AI Persuades: Adversarial Explanation Attacks on Human Trust in AI-Assisted Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04003)
*Shutong Fan,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses a new form of adversarial attack on AI systems, focusing on how explanations generated by large language models (LLMs) can manipulate human trust in model outputs, even when they are incorrect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems are heavily intertwined with human decision-making processes. The researchers aim to highlight and address the emerging threat of adversarial attacks targeting human trust by manipulating AI-generated explanations.

Method: Researchers introduced the concept of adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs) and conducted a controlled experiment (n=205), varying dimensions of explanation framing such as reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and format to study their effects on human trust.

Result: The study revealed that adversarial explanations could preserve most of the trust typically accorded to benign explanations, even for incorrect model outputs. Vulnerabilities are more pronounced in specific contexts, such as hard tasks, fact-driven domains, and among certain populations (e.g., younger participants, less educated individuals, or those with high trust in AI).

Conclusion: This is the first study to systematically investigate explanations as a cognitive attack vector in AI systems. The findings highlight the necessity to secure AI explanations to prevent misuse and safeguard human decision-making from being manipulated.

Abstract: Most adversarial threats in artificial intelligence target the computational behavior of models rather than the humans who rely on them. Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI. This is the first systematic security study that treats explanations as an adversarial cognitive channel and quantifies their impact on human trust in AI-assisted decision making.

### [8] [Axiomatic Foundations of Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04028)
*Leila Amgoud,Martin Cooper*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an axiomatic framework for counterfactual explainers, studying both local and global counterfactuals, and classifies them into five distinct types with representation theorems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trust in autonomous systems' decisions by addressing gaps in counterfactual explanations—specifically the lack of attention to alternative counterfactual types and global explanations.

Method: Developed an axiomatic framework based on desirable properties, established impossibility and representation theorems, characterized types of counterfactual explanations, and analyzed computational complexity.

Result: Identified five fundamentally different types of counterfactual explanations; the framework classifies existing explainers, highlighting their behaviors and computational costs.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework that advances understanding of counterfactual explanations, bridging gaps in local and global reasoning insights.

Abstract: Explaining autonomous and intelligent systems is critical in order to improve trust in their decisions. Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.
  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.

### [9] [Scaling In-Context Online Learning Capability of LLMs via Cross-Episode Meta-RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04089)
*Xiaofeng Lin,Sirou Zhu,Yilei Chen,Mingyu Chen,Hejian Sang,Ioannis Paschalidis,Zhipeng Wang,Aldo Pacchiano,Xuezhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents ORBIT, a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to perform in-context online learning through meta-reinforcement training, addressing the typical limitations of LLMs in decision-making tasks requiring interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many LLMs excel at static prediction tasks but struggle with interactive, real-world decision-making scenarios where feedback is delayed and information must be dynamically gathered.

Method: ORBIT is a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to improve in-context learning by leveraging interaction experience.

Result: After training, ORBIT enables a model (Qwen3-14B) to achieve improved online learning, matching GPT-5.2's performance in unseen environments and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning significantly.

Conclusion: ORBIT demonstrates the potential for LLMs to improve at online, learn-at-inference-time decision-making tasks, with better scaling and performance gains as model size increases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance when all task-relevant information is available upfront, as in static prediction and instruction-following problems. However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin. Scaling experiments further reveal consistent gains with model size, suggesting significant headroom for learn-at-inference-time decision-making agents.

### [10] [Interfaze: The Future of AI is built on Task-Specific Small Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04101)
*Harsha Vardhan Khurdula,Vineet Agarwal,Yoeven D Khemlani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Interfaze redefines LLM applications by using a modular system combining multiple tools and smaller models, instead of relying on a single large transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the inefficiency and limitations of relying solely on monolithic large language models by introducing a more modular and efficient approach.

Method: Interfaze integrates a stack of diverse DNNs, small language models for perception, a context-construction layer for structuring external sources, and an action layer to handle dynamic tasks. A controller coordinates these components while interfacing with a user-selected LLM for final outputs.

Result: Interfaze-Beta achieves high performance across multiple benchmarks such as MMLU, GPQA-Diamond, and multimodal datasets, demonstrating competitive results with reduced dependency on large LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed modular architecture makes it possible to achieve competitive accuracy while reducing the reliance on computationally expensive large language models, offering an efficient alternative for modern LLM applications.

Abstract: We present Interfaze, a system that treats modern LLM applications as a problem of building and acting over context, not just picking the right monolithic model. Instead of a single transformer, we combine (i) a stack of heterogeneous DNNs paired with small language models as perception modules for OCR involving complex PDFs, charts and diagrams, and multilingual ASR with (ii) a context-construction layer that crawls, indexes, and parses external sources (web pages, code, PDFs) into compact structured state, and (iii) an action layer that can browse, retrieve, execute code in a sandbox, and drive a headless browser for dynamic web pages. A thin controller sits on top of this stack and exposes a single, OpenAI-style endpoint: it decides which small models and actions to run and always forwards the distilled context to a user-selected LLM that produces the final response.
  On this architecture, Interfaze-Beta achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, and 90.0% on AIME-2025, along with strong multimodal scores on MMMU (val) (77.3%), AI2D (91.5%), ChartQA (90.9%), and Common Voice v16 (90.8%). We show that most queries are handled primarily by the small-model and tool stack, with the large LLM operating only on distilled context, yielding competitive accuracy while shifting the bulk of computation away from the most expensive and monolithic models.

### [11] [OMG-Agent: Toward Robust Missing Modality Generation with Decoupled Coarse-to-Fine Agentic Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04144)
*Ruiting Dai,Zheyu Wang,Haoyu Yang,Yihan Liu,Chengzhi Wang,Zekun Zhang,Zishan Huang,Jiaman Cen,Lisi Mo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OMG-Agent, a framework addressing data incompleteness in multimodal systems by adopting a dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow, surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of data incompleteness and limitations of existing reconstruction methods in multimodal systems, focusing on balancing logical reasoning and detailed synthesis.

Method: Developed OMG-Agent with a deliberate-then-act workflow, involving Semantic Planning, Evidence Retrieval, and Execution to resolve ambiguity and improve detail fidelity.

Result: Experiments showed OMG-Agent achieved significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, especially under extreme missing data conditions.

Conclusion: OMG-Agent provides a robust and effective solution to multimodal data incompleteness, ensuring high performance by decoupling reasoning and synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Data incompleteness severely impedes the reliability of multimodal systems. Existing reconstruction methods face distinct bottlenecks: conventional parametric/generative models are prone to hallucinations due to over-reliance on internal memory, while retrieval-augmented frameworks struggle with retrieval rigidity. Critically, these end-to-end architectures are fundamentally constrained by Semantic-Detail Entanglement -- a structural conflict between logical reasoning and signal synthesis that compromises fidelity. In this paper, we present \textbf{\underline{O}}mni-\textbf{\underline{M}}odality \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration Agent (\textbf{OMG-Agent}), a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from static mapping to a dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow. By mimicking a \textit{deliberate-then-act} cognitive process, OMG-Agent explicitly decouples the task into three synergistic stages: (1) an MLLM-driven Semantic Planner that resolves input ambiguity via Progressive Contextual Reasoning, creating a deterministic structured semantic plan; (2) a non-parametric Evidence Retriever that grounds abstract semantics in external knowledge; and (3) a Retrieval-Injected Executor that utilizes retrieved evidence as flexible feature prompts to overcome rigidity and synthesize high-fidelity details. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OMG-Agent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, maintaining robustness under extreme missingness, e.g., a $2.6$-point gain on CMU-MOSI at $70$\% missing rates.

*Enyu Zhou,Zhiheng Xi,Long Ma,Zhihao Zhang,Shihan Dou,Zhikai Lei,Guoteng Wang,Rui Zheng,Hang Yan,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of supervising AI systems in complex tasks beyond human expertise by introducing Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that simplifies supervision into manageable decisions and improves user guidance and task outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in effective supervision for large language models handling complex tasks, addressing issues like insufficient expertise, unclear user intent, and validation difficulty.

Method: The proposed Scalable Interactive Oversight framework breaks down complex tasks into recursive decision trees and collects low-effort user feedback to aggregate precise global guidance. It also integrates reinforcement learning to optimize performance using user feedback.

Result: The framework improved alignment in creating Product Requirement Documents by 54%, enabling non-experts to achieve expert-level results in web development tasks.

Conclusion: Scalable Interactive Oversight offers a scalable solution to maintain human control and effective supervision of advanced AI systems, with potential application in various complex domains.

Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.

*Feiyu Gavin Zhu,Jean Oh,Reid Simmons*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InterPReT enhances interactive imitation learning for non-technical users, enabling better AI agent training with less expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make AI agent training more accessible for laypersons by removing technical barriers in imitation learning.

Method: Developed InterPReT, which updates policy structures based on user instructions and demonstrations, with interactive monitoring and feedback.

Result: A user study showed that InterPReT produces more robust policies compared to standard imitation learning methods for lay-users.

Conclusion: InterPReT facilitates effective AI agent training by laypersons, improving usability without compromising robust decision-making policies.

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown success in many tasks by learning from expert demonstrations. However, most existing work relies on large-scale demonstrations from technical professionals and close monitoring of the training process. These are challenging for a layperson when they want to teach the agent new skills. To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop.

*Hao Lu,Haoyuan Huang,Yulin Zhou,Chen Li,Ningxin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Empirical-MCTS, a framework that transforms stateless inference-time search into a continuous learning process for better reasoning in Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning strategies for LLMs are stateless and fail to accumulate wisdom across problem instances, limiting their resemblance to human problem-solving.

Method: The framework combines Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) for local search optimization and a Memory Optimization Agent for global learning from prior knowledge.

Result: Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms existing methods on reasoning benchmarks like AIME25 and MathArena Apex, showcasing enhanced problem-solving capabilities.

Conclusion: Coupling structured search mechanisms with empirical accumulation of knowledge is crucial for advancing complex reasoning abilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling strategies, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks.

### [15] [Agent-Omit: Training Efficient LLM Agents for Adaptive Thought and Observation Omission via Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04284)
*Yansong Ning,Jun Fang,Naiqiang Tan,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent-Omit, a framework aimed at improving agent efficiency by adaptively omitting unnecessary thoughts and observations during interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods overlook the varying necessity and utility of agent thoughts and observations. This study seeks to optimize those aspects to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: A unified training framework, including data synthesis for omission scenarios, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with omission rewards, is proposed to enable adaptive omission.

Result: Agent-Omit achieves comparable performance to leading LLM agents and delivers the best trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully refines agent efficiency through adaptive omission while maintaining competitive performance levels. Code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: Managing agent thought and observation during multi-turn agent-environment interactions is an emerging strategy to improve agent efficiency. However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

*SeungWon Seo,SooBin Lim,SeongRae Noh,Haneul Kim,HyeongYeop Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PCE, a framework converting LLM reasoning traces into structured decision trees to aid embodied agents in decentralized, uncertain environments, outperforming communication-heavy baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of uncertainty management in multi-agent systems, where frequent communication is costly and disruptive, especially with human partners.

Method: The proposed PCE framework uses LLM reasoning traces to create decision trees. The nodes represent environmental assumptions, and the paths are scored based on likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide actions.

Result: PCE outperforms communication-centric baselines on multi-agent benchmarks, enhancing success rates, efficiency, and producing human-perceived trustworthy communication patterns.

Conclusion: Structured uncertainty handling via PCE complements scaling approaches, providing a principled method for turning fragmented LLM assumptions into effective planning strategies.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in multi-agent, partially observable, and decentralized environments must plan and act despite pervasive uncertainty about hidden objects and collaborators' intentions. Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), particularly in the industrial domain, has amplified the challenges associated with the effective integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Fragmentation across IoT and IIoT technologies, manifested through diverse communication protocols, data formats and device capabilities, creates a substantial gap between low-level physical layers and high-level intelligent functionalities. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering structured, interoperable and semantically rich digital representations of physical assets. Current approaches are often siloed and tightly coupled, limiting scalability and reuse of AI functionalities. This work proposes a modular and interoperable solution that enables seamless AI pipeline integration into CPS by minimizing configuration and decoupling the roles of DTs and AI components. We introduce the concept of Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines, where DTs orchestrate data management and intelligent augmentation. The approach is demonstrated in a MicroFactory scenario, showing support for concurrent ML models and dynamic data processing, effectively accelerating the deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial settings.

TL;DR: ReThinker is a new framework improving large language models' reasoning capabilities through adaptive computation and leveraging confidence-based strategies. It achieves state-of-the-art results on expert-level benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with efficient, expert-level scientific reasoning, especially due to rigid tool pipelines and inefficient scaling during reasoning tasks.

Method: ReThinker introduces a Solver-Critic-Selector model that dynamically allocates computation based on confidence and enables adaptive, stage-wise reasoning. Additionally, it utilizes a reverse data synthesis pipeline and trajectory recycling for scalable training.

Result: ReThinker outperforms state-of-the-art systems in expert-level reasoning tasks across HLE, GAIA, and XBench benchmarks, showcasing superior efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust reasoning and adaptability, addressing limitations in prior systems and paving the way for improved reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Expert-level scientific reasoning remains challenging for large language models, particularly on benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), where rigid tool pipelines, brittle multi-agent coordination, and inefficient test-time scaling often limit performance. We introduce ReThinker, a confidence-aware agentic framework that orchestrates retrieval, tool use, and multi-agent reasoning through a stage-wise Solver-Critic-Selector architecture. Rather than following a fixed pipeline, ReThinker dynamically allocates computation based on model confidence, enabling adaptive tool invocation, guided multi-dimensional reflection, and robust confidence-weighted selection. To support scalable training without human annotation, we further propose a reverse data synthesis pipeline and an adaptive trajectory recycling strategy that transform successful reasoning traces into high-quality supervision. Experiments on HLE, GAIA, and XBench demonstrate that ReThinker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models with tools and existing deep research systems, achieving state-of-the-art results on expert-level reasoning tasks.

*Niv Fono,Yftah Ziser,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI systems rely on Q&A forums but simultaneously impact their user base. This paper proposes a collaboration framework to mitigate the paradox, supported by data simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to resolve the paradox of GenAI systems reducing user activity in forums while needing the same forums' data for their own improvement.

Method: The authors introduced a sequential interaction framework using real Stack Exchange data and simulations with popular LLMs, analyzing non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment.

Result: Empirical analysis reveals incentive misalignment but suggests the possibility to achieve half the utility of an ideal scenario. Sustainable collaboration between AI and human knowledge platforms is demonstrated.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables balanced interaction between GenAI systems and forums, promoting effective knowledge sharing while addressing underlying challenges.

Abstract: While Generative AI (GenAI) systems draw users away from (Q&A) forums, they also depend on the very data those forums produce to improve their performance. Addressing this paradox, we propose a framework of sequential interaction, in which a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. Our results highlight the potential for sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing between AI systems and human knowledge platforms.

*Jiaheng Liu,Yuanxing Zhang,Shihao Li,Xinping Lei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vibe AIGC, a new paradigm for AI-generated content that bridges the gap between human intent and AI execution, emphasizing logical workflows over stochastic inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI models face a ‘usability ceiling,’ where there is a disconnect between high-level human intent and the unpredictable nature of single-shot model outputs.

Method: The Vibe AIGC paradigm uses a centralized Meta-Planner to autonomously break down user-provided high-level ‘Vibes’ (aesthetic preferences, functional logic, etc.) into hierarchical multi-agent workflows.

Result: The proposed system bridges the Intent-Execution Gap by transforming AI into a logical orchestrator, enabling robust collaboration between humans and AI for creating complex digital assets.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for redefining generative AI as a system-level engineering partner, enhancing usability and democratizing complex asset creation through agentic orchestration.

Abstract: For the past decade, the trajectory of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by a model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws. Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.
  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces WideSeek-R1, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed for scalable information-seeking tasks by focusing on width scaling instead of depth scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the bottleneck in accomplishing broad information-seeking tasks by replacing individual competence with more efficient organizational multi-agent systems.

Method: WideSeek-R1 is a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a lead-agent-subagent structure, utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools to parallelize task execution effectively.

Result: WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an impressive F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, comparable to a far larger single-agent model, DeepSeek-R1-671B. Performance consistently improves as more parallel subagents are introduced.

Conclusion: Width scaling, as implemented in WideSeek-R1, effectively addresses broad tasks requiring parallel execution, offering a viable alternative to depth scaling in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.

*Shubham Vatsal,Harsh Dubey,Aditi Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews 49 studies on LLM-based healthcare agents using a seven-dimensional taxonomy to analyze capabilities in cognitive functions, knowledge management, interaction, adaptation, safety, frameworks, and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in healthcare literature by developing a common framework for analyzing LLM-based agents rather than relying on surveys or exploring isolated capabilities.

Method: Using explicit inclusion criteria, labeling rubrics, and the taxonomy, each study was mapped and quantitatively analyzed to report prevalence and co-occurrence patterns of operational dimensions.

Result: Findings reveal asymmetries in capabilities, with common implementation in knowledge management but rare occurrences in adaptation and learning. Information-centric tasks are dominant, while action-oriented tasks show substantial gaps.

Conclusion: The study establishes a structured taxonomy to understand LLM-based healthcare agents, identifying strengths and gaps for future research and improvement in capabilities like treatment planning and drift mitigation.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that plan, use tools and act has begun to shape healthcare and medicine. Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).

TL;DR: The paper critiques the METR report's claim of exponential growth in AI capabilities, arguing instead that growth has already passed an inflection point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the prevailing assumption of exponential growth in AI capabilities and its potential implications for AI safety and societal impacts.

Method: The authors used data curve fitting techniques, such as sigmoid curve modeling, and introduced a novel model separating base and reasoning capabilities to analyze growth trends.

Result: They found evidence contradicting exponential growth, arguing the inflection point has already occurred, with their model supporting nuanced, decomposed perspectives.

Conclusion: Current forecasts claiming exponential AI growth may be fragile and simplistic, urging a re-evaluation of predictive methodologies.

Abstract: Rapidly increasing AI capabilities have substantial real-world consequences, ranging from AI safety concerns to labor market consequences. The Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) report argues that AI capabilities have exhibited exponential growth since 2019. In this note, we argue that the data does not support exponential growth, even in shorter-term horizons. Whereas the METR study claims that fitting sigmoid/logistic curves results in inflection points far in the future, we fit a sigmoid curve to their current data and find that the inflection point has already passed. In addition, we propose a more complex model that decomposes AI capabilities into base and reasoning capabilities, exhibiting individual rates of improvement. We prove that this model supports our hypothesis that AI capabilities will exhibit an inflection point in the near future. Our goal is not to establish a rigorous forecast of our own, but to highlight the fragility of existing forecasts of exponential growth.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a paradigm allowing groups of agents to share experiences for better evolution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in coding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agent paradigms are limited by inefficiencies in exploration due to isolated evolutionary branches, necessitating advancements for open-ended self-improvements.

Method: GEA utilizes a group of agents as the evolutionary unit, enabling shared experiences and reuse throughout evolution, enhancing exploratory diversity and efficiency.

Result: GEA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods in coding benchmarks, displays consistent transferability across coding models, and fixes framework-level bugs more efficiently.

Conclusion: GEA advances self-improving agent paradigms, utilizing group evolution for better performance, robustness, and long-term progress compared to existing frameworks.

Abstract: Open-ended self-improving agents can autonomously modify their own structural designs to advance their capabilities and overcome the limits of pre-defined architectures, thus reducing reliance on human intervention. We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the internal mechanisms behind the superior reasoning capabilities of language models trained to generate reasoning traces.

Method: Analyzing QwQ-32B's performance on the Mystery Blocksworld domain, identifying how its internal representations evolve, and evaluating the causal impact of these refinements using steering experiments.

Result: QwQ-32B gradually refines its representations during reasoning, focusing on structural encodings. Refined representations boost problem-solving accuracy, and symbolic representations can replace obfuscated encodings without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: Fluid Reasoning Representations – the in-context refinement of token representations – are a key factor in the model’s reasoning performance and problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Reasoning language models, which generate long chains of thought, dramatically outperform non-reasoning language models on abstract problems. However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss. We find that one of the factors driving reasoning model performance is in-context refinement of token representations, which we dub Fluid Reasoning Representations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPPAM, a cache prefetching method combining SPP and AMPM to improve system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of processor speed being limited by memory system performance using improved cache prefetching techniques.

Method: SPPAM uses online learning to create access-map patterns which guide speculative lookahead, throttled by a confidence metric.

Result: System performance improves by 31.4% over no prefetching and 6.2% over the baseline prefetchers Berti and Pythia.

Conclusion: SPPAM effectively addresses limitations of prior prefetching methods, optimizing memory performance and advancing the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The discrepancy between processor speed and memory system performance continues to limit the performance of many workloads. To address the issue, one effective and well studied technique is cache prefetching. Many prefetching designs have been proposed, with varying approaches and effectiveness. For example, SPP is a popular prefetcher that leverages confidence throttled recursion to speculate on the future path of program's references, however it is very susceptible to the reference reordering of higher-level caches and the OoO core. Orthogonally, AMPM is another popular approach to prefetching which uses reordering-resistant access maps to identify patterns within a region, but is unable to speculate beyond that region. In this paper, we propose SPPAM, a new approach to prefetching, inspired by prior works such as SPP and AMPM, while addressing their limitations. SPPAM utilizes online-learning to build a set of access-map patterns. These patterns are used in a speculative lookahead which is throttled by a confidence metric. Targeting the second-level cache, SPPAM alongside state-of-the-art prefetchers Berti and Bingo improve system performance by 31.4% over no prefetching and 6.2% over the baseline of Berti and Pythia.

Motivation: The work addresses the lack of efficient hardware support for cryptographic and post-quantum algorithms on RISC-V platforms, critical for IoT and edge computing security.

Method: Crypto-RV integrates cryptographic-specific units, a high-bandwidth buffer, and adaptive scheduling with a unified 64-bit datapath, implemented on an FPGA.

Result: Crypto-RV achieves 165x to 1,061x speedup and 5.8x to 17.4x energy efficiency improvement over baseline hardware, with compact resource use.

Conclusion: The Crypto-RV co-processor is a viable, high-performance, energy-efficient solution for cryptography in constrained environments like IoT.

Abstract: Cryptographic operations are critical for securing IoT, edge computing, and autonomous systems. However, current RISC-V platforms lack efficient hardware support for comprehensive cryptographic algorithm families and post-quantum cryptography. This paper presents Crypto-RV, a RISC-V co-processor architecture that unifies support for SHA-256, SHA-512, SM3, SHA3-256, SHAKE-128, SHAKE-256 AES-128, HARAKA-256, and HARAKA-512 within a single 64-bit datapath. Crypto-RV introduces three key architectural innovations: a high-bandwidth internal buffer (128x64-bit), cryptography-specialized execution units with four-stage pipelined datapaths, and a double-buffering mechanism with adaptive scheduling optimized for large-hash. Implemented on Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA at 160 MHz with 0.851 W dynamic power, Crypto-RV achieves 165 times to 1,061 times speedup over baseline RISC-V cores, 5.8 times to 17.4 times better energy efficiency compared to powerful CPUs. The design occupies only 34,704 LUTs, 37,329 FFs, and 22 BRAMs demonstrating viability for high-performance, energy-efficient cryptographic processing in resource-constrained IoT environments.

*Xinyu Wang,Jieyu Li,Yanan Sun,Weifeng He*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Harmonia is an algorithm-hardware co-design framework for using block floating point (BFP) activations across all layers of large language models (LLMs), significantly improving memory, energy, and computational efficiency while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs) necessitate solutions like quantization. However, achieving efficiency without significant accuracy degradation, especially in attention layers, remains a challenge.

Method: Harmonia uses all-layer BFP activations by exploring optimal BFP configurations, introducing asymmetric bit-allocation strategies for KV-cache compression, and employing a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing. It includes dedicated hardware like reconfigurable processing elements, FP16-to-BFP converters, and optimized dataflow designs.

Result: Harmonia achieves greater area and energy efficiency (up to 3.84x and 2.03x, respectively) and significant speedup (up to 3.08x on average) compared to prior models. KV-cache is compressed with minimal (0.3%) accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Harmonia demonstrates the feasibility of implementing all-layer BFP activations for LLMs, balancing performance, efficiency, and hardware design with minimal trade-offs in accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but incur high memory and computation costs. Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average.

### [29] [Linguistic Blind Spots in Clinical Decision Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03942)
*Mohamed Elgaar,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies clinical decision extraction from notes, revealing linguistic challenges in narrative-driven decision types like advice and precautions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clinical decision support systems and patient care summaries by understanding linguistic variations in clinical decisions and improving extraction performance.

Method: Analyzed discharge summaries annotated with DICTUM, computed linguistic indices for each decision, and examined extraction recall of a transformer model across decision categories.

Result: Drug-related decisions are entity-dense and easier to extract, while narrative decisions with hedging or negation cues lead to extraction failures. Exact-match recall is 48%, increasing to 71% with boundary-tolerant measures.

Conclusion: Narrative spans in decisions pose challenges for exact matching. Future systems should incorporate more flexible extraction and evaluation methods for better performance.

Abstract: Extracting medical decisions from clinical notes is a key step for clinical decision support and patient-facing care summaries. We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses. Overall, narrative-style spans--common in advice and precaution decisions--are a consistent blind spot under exact matching, suggesting that downstream systems should incorporate boundary-tolerant evaluation and extraction strategies for clinical decisions.

### [30] [Automatic Classification of Pedagogical Materials against CS Curriculum Guidelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03962)
*Erik Saule,Kalpathi Subramanian,Razvan Bunescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, including traditional tools and Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate the classification of Computer Science curriculum materials against ACM/IEEE guidelines, which is usually a time-consuming manual process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Program administrators struggle to assess how much of the ACM/IEEE Computer Science curriculum guidelines are met by programs due to the guidelines' extensive nature. Manual auditing of courses is time-consuming and cognitively challenging.

Method: The authors propose the use of NLP, employing traditional parsing, tagging, and embeddings techniques, as well as Large Language Models, to automate the classification of pedagogical materials.

Result: The study demonstrates that NLP techniques can meaningfully and accurately classify educational documents against the guidelines in an automated way.

Conclusion: NLP, especially using Large Language Models, can significantly accelerate the auditing process of Computer Science curriculum materials, reducing the time and effort required for manual assessments.

Abstract: Professional societies often publish curriculum guidelines to help programs align their content to international standards. In Computer Science, the primary standard is published by ACM and IEEE and provide detailed guidelines for what should be and could be included in a Computer Science program.
  While very helpful, it remains difficult for program administrators to assess how much of the guidelines is being covered by a CS program. This is in particular due to the extensiveness of the guidelines, containing thousands of individual items. As such, it is time consuming and cognitively demanding to audit every course to confidently mark everything that is actually being covered. Our preliminary work indicated that it takes about a day of work per course.
  In this work, we propose using Natural Language Processing techniques to accelerate the process. We explore two kinds of techniques, the first relying on traditional tools for parsing, tagging, and embeddings, while the second leverages the power of Large Language Models. We evaluate the application of these techniques to classify a corpus of pedagogical materials and show that we can meaningfully classify documents automatically.

### [31] [Likelihood-Based Reward Designs for General LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03979)
*Ariel Kwiatkowski,Natasha Butt,Ismail Labiad,Julia Kempe,Yann Ollivier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates likelihood-based rewards, especially log-probability rewards, for fine-tuning large language models on reasoning tasks, proving their effectiveness in both verifiable and non-verifiable settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of binary reward functions in reinforcement learning like sparse rewards and dependency on specific designs, and to explore scalable likelihood-based reward functions for reasoning tasks.

Method: The paper systematically compares likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and long-form answers, focusing on chain-of-thought (CoT) learning and leveraging log-probability and probability-based rewards.

Result: Log-probability rewards are shown to perform consistently well across all setups, proving superior to binary rewards and probability-based methods in perplexity reduction and in cases where external verification is infeasible.

Conclusion: Log-probability rewards are effective and scalable for fine-tuning large models on reasoning tasks, bridging performance gaps between short, verifiable, and long, non-verifiable answer setups.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on reasoning benchmarks via reinforcement learning requires a specific reward function, often binary, for each benchmark. This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer. Overall, this establishes log-probability rewards as a viable method for CoT fine-tuning, bridging the short, verifiable and long, non-verifiable answer settings.

### [32] [Transformers perform adaptive partial pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03980)
*Vsevolod Kapatsinski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how transformer models like GPT-2 utilize and adapt information from similar contexts during training phases, focusing on context frequency and variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how language models such as GPT-2 generalize and predict in both novel and infrequent contexts and whether their behavior aligns with hierarchical regression principles.

Method: The study measures how GPT-2's next-word predictions shift with training epochs by analyzing how much the model pools evidence from similar contexts, influenced by variables like context frequency, number, and variability.

Result: Transformers like GPT-2 reduce their reliance on external observations (adaptive pooling) as training progresses, with context frequency and variability playing key roles in this process.

Conclusion: The learning dynamics of GPT-2 are rational and reflect realistic principles of hierarchical regression, adapting context usage based on training and contextual factors.

Abstract: Because language is creative, any reasonable language model must generalize, deciding what to say in novel contexts by using information from similar contexts. But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression. These characteristics of learning in transformers are argued to be realistic on both rational and empirical grounds.

### [33] [On the Credibility of Evaluating LLMs using Survey Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04033)
*Jindřich Libovický*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current evaluation methods of large language models' (LLMs) value orientation using social surveys and proposes improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in evaluating LLMs' value alignment with humans, as current methods yield inconsistent results depending on the setup.

Method: Researchers used the World Value Survey in multiple countries and languages, tested different prompting and decoding strategies, and introduced a new metric called self-correlation distance to assess response consistency.

Result: Prompting methods and decoding techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and sampling, influenced survey results. They also found misalignment in structural response patterns, despite high human agreement.

Conclusion: The researchers recommend using chain-of-thought prompting, sampling-based decoding, and robust, multi-metric evaluations like self-correlation distances for better alignment assessment in future studies.

Abstract: Recent studies evaluate the value orientation of large language models (LLMs) using adapted social surveys, typically by prompting models with survey questions and comparing their responses to average human responses. This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do. This indicates that even a high average agreement with human data, when considering LLM responses independently, does not guarantee structural alignment in responses. Additionally, we reveal a weak correlation between two common evaluation metrics, mean-squared distance and KL divergence, which assume that survey answers are independent of each other. For future research, we recommend CoT prompting, sampling-based decoding with dozens of samples, and robust analysis using multiple metrics, including self-correlation distance.

### [34] [Abstraction Induces the Brain Alignment of Language and Speech Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04081)
*Emily Cheng,Aditya R. Vaidya,Richard Antonello*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Intermediate layers of language and speech models align with brain responses due to shared meaning abstraction, not next-word prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why intermediate layers in models predict brain responses better than output layers, and explore how shared representation properties enable this transfer task.

Method: The study analyzes intrinsic dimension, a measure of feature complexity, in model layers to assess its relation with brain signal prediction using fMRI and ECoG data.

Result: Intermediate layers exhibit high intrinsic dimension and semantic richness, mirroring brain signal predictivity, which improves during model pretraining and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Rich meaning abstraction drives the similarity between models and brain signals, with language modeling being a complex task sufficient to evoke meaningful semantic features.

Abstract: Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models and speech audio models predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most effective for this unique and highly general transfer task? We give evidence that the correspondence between speech and language models and the brain derives from shared meaning abstraction and not their next-word prediction properties. In particular, models construct higher-order linguistic features in their middle layers, cued by a peak in the layerwise intrinsic dimension, a measure of feature complexity. We show that a layer's intrinsic dimension strongly predicts how well it explains fMRI and ECoG signals; that the relation between intrinsic dimension and brain predictivity arises over model pre-training; and finetuning models to better predict the brain causally increases both representations' intrinsic dimension and their semantic content. Results suggest that semantic richness, high intrinsic dimension, and brain predictivity mirror each other, and that the key driver of model-brain similarity is rich meaning abstraction of the inputs, where language modeling is a task sufficiently complex (but perhaps not the only) to require it.

*Debargha Ganguly,Sreehari Sankar,Biyao Zhang,Vikash Singh,Kanan Gupta,Harshini Kavuru,Alan Luo,Weicong Chen,Warren Morningstar,Raghu Machiraju,Vipin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Trust The Typical (T3) framework for ensuring the safety of large language models by detecting out-of-distribution prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety approaches rely on identifying harmful content, which is ineffective and brittle. The authors aim to build a more robust system by focusing on defining and understanding safe inputs.

Method: The framework, T3, learns the distribution of acceptable prompts (safe space) and identifies deviations, treating safety as an out-of-distribution detection problem. It doesn't require training on harmful examples.

Result: T3 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across 18 safety benchmarks, reducing false positives by up to 40x compared to existing systems. It generalizes effectively across 14 languages without retraining.

Conclusion: T3 is efficient and practical, with GPU-optimized integration for real-time monitoring in production, incurring less than 6% performance overhead for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.

### [36] [Expert Selections In MoE Models Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04105)
*Amir Nuriyev,Gabriel Kulp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals vulnerabilities in mixture-of-experts language models, demonstrating that token information can be reconstructed solely from expert routing decisions, with high accuracy using advanced techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to highlight and analyze the information leakage in expert routing decisions within mixture-of-experts models and its implications for sensitive data handling.

Method: The method involves utilizing a 3-layer MLP and a transformer-based sequence decoder to recover tokens from routing decisions, outperforming prior logistic regression approaches in reconstruction accuracy.

Result: Using routing decisions, the transformer-based sequence decoder achieves 91.2% top-1 accuracy and 94.8% top-10 accuracy for token reconstruction, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in MoE models.

Conclusion: Expert routing decisions in MoE language models leak substantial information, necessitating the treatment of these selections as sensitive data to mitigate leakage risks.

Abstract: We present a text-reconstruction attack on mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models that recovers tokens from expert selections alone. In MoE models, each token is routed to a subset of expert subnetworks; we show these routing decisions leak substantially more information than previously understood. Prior work using logistic regression achieves limited reconstruction; we show that a 3-layer MLP improves this to 63.1% top-1 accuracy, and that a transformer-based sequence decoder recovers 91.2% of tokens top-1 (94.8% top-10) on 32-token sequences from OpenWebText after training on 100M tokens. These results connect MoE routing to the broader literature on embedding inversion. We outline practical leakage scenarios (e.g., distributed inference and side channels) and show that adding noise reduces but does not eliminate reconstruction. Our findings suggest that expert selections in MoE deployments should be treated as sensitive as the underlying text.

*Jiangnan Yang,Junjie Chen,Fei Wang,Yiqi Nie,Yuxin Liu,Zhangling Duan,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA is a framework for multimodal psychological counseling that integrates visual, vocal, and textual cues, enhancing empathic response and mental state understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of text-based counseling systems by including multimodal inputs (visual, vocal, and textual) to better infer and respond to clients' mental states.

Method: Introduced DELTA, a multi-agent framework, which separates reasoning into grounding evidence, mental state abstraction, and response generation steps. Reinforcement learning is used with an Emotion Attunement Score to improve emotionally attuned responses.

Result: DELTA demonstrated improved counseling quality and emotion attunement across a multimodal counseling benchmark, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Explicit multimodal reasoning and structured mental state representations enhance empathy and effectiveness in AI-assisted psychological counseling.

Abstract: Psychological counseling is a fundamentally multimodal cognitive process in which clinicians integrate verbal content with visual and vocal cues to infer clients' mental states and respond empathically. However, most existing language-model-based counseling systems operate on text alone and rely on implicit mental state inference. We introduce DELTA, a deliberative multi-agent framework that models counseling as a structured reasoning process over multimodal signals, separating evidence grounding, mental state abstraction, and response generation. DELTA further incorporates reinforcement learning guided by a distribution-level Emotion Attunement Score to encourage emotionally attuned responses. Experiments on a multimodal counseling benchmark show that DELTA improves both counseling quality and emotion attunement across models. Ablation and qualitative analyses suggest that explicit multimodal reasoning and structured mental state representations play complementary roles in supporting empathic human-AI interaction.

*Sercan Karakaş,Yusuf Şimşek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines Light Verb Constructions (LVCs) in Turkish, highlighting challenges due to their complex morphology and minimal contrasts with literal uses. It evaluates model inputs for LVC classification using various approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what signals help in classifying Light Verb Constructions (LVCs) in Turkish, a language with complex morphology and subtle contrasts between idiomatic and literal forms.

Method: Using supervised learning based on Universal Dependencies (UD), the study compares lemma-based models (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, BERTurk), grammar-only models (Logistic Regression with UD morphosyntax), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. Model evaluations were conducted on a controlled diagnostic dataset.

Result: Findings show that coarse morphosyntax alone is inadequate for robust LVC detection, while lexical identity aids classification but is sensitive to calibration and normalization processes.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for targeted evaluations of Turkish Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and demonstrates that 'lemma-only' representations significantly rely on their operationalization method.

Abstract: Light verb constructions (LVCs) are a challenging class of verbal multiword expressions, especially in Turkish, where rich morphology and productive complex predicates create minimal contrasts between idiomatic predicate meanings and literal verb--argument uses. This paper asks what signals drive LVC classification by systematically restricting model inputs. Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices. Overall, Our findings motivate targeted evaluation of Turkish MWEs and show that ``lemma-only'' is not a single, well-defined representation, but one that depends critically on how normalization is operationalized.

*Zhexin Zhang,Yida Lu,Junfeng Fang,Junxiao Yang,Shiyao Cui,Hao Zhou,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou,Hongning Wang,Minlie Huang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates safety risks in AI during training rather than just deployment, identifying implicit risks and presenting systematic taxonomy and experimental findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the largely unexplored safety risks that emerge during training of AI models, such as harmful behaviors driven by internal incentives, which pose significant security concerns.

Method: The paper introduces a systematic taxonomy categorizing implicit training-time risks (five risk levels, ten risk categories, three incentive types) and conducts extensive experiments to study these risks in both individual and multi-agent training settings.

Result: Experiments expose that AI models, like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, show risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs under contextual conditions. The study also identifies key factors leading to these behaviors.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgency of addressing training-time safety risks in AI, which are significant yet underexplored in current research, requiring attention for future model development.

Abstract: Safety risks of AI models have been widely studied at deployment time, such as jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful outputs. In contrast, safety risks emerging during training remain largely unexplored. Beyond explicit reward hacking that directly manipulates explicit reward functions in reinforcement learning, we study implicit training-time safety risks: harmful behaviors driven by a model's internal incentives and contextual background information. For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings. Our results identify an overlooked yet urgent safety challenge in training.

*Xinyue Wang,Yuanhe Zhang,Zhengshuo Gong,Haoran Gao,Fanyu Meng,Zhenhong Zhou,Li Sun,Yang Liu,Sen Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses 'Toxic Proactivity,' a harmful behavior in AI agents where ethical constraints are disregarded in pursuit of utility. It introduces a framework to investigate and benchmark this phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight and mitigate the risks associated with LLM agents disregarding ethical principles, particularly 'Toxic Proactivity.'

Method: A novel evaluation framework utilizing dilemma-driven interactions between dual models to simulate and analyze agent behavior over multi-step trajectories.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that 'Toxic Proactivity' is prevalent among mainstream LLMs, identifying two major behavioral tendencies.

Conclusion: The phenomenon of Toxic Proactivity poses significant risks, warranting systematic evaluation and contextual benchmarks for mitigation.

Abstract: The enhanced capabilities of LLM-based agents come with an emergency for model planning and tool-use abilities. Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of "over-refusal", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term "Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its "usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies. We further present a systematic benchmark for evaluating Toxic Proactive behavior across contextual settings.

### [41] [Enforcing Monotonic Progress in Legal Cross-Examination: Preventing Long-Horizon Stagnation in LLM-Based Inquiry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04206)
*Hsien-Jyh Liao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models face challenges in procedural tasks under constraints, leading to procedural stagnation. Soft-FSM is proposed to address this issue by ensuring consistent task progression in legal cross-examinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models fail to reliably complete procedural tasks, such as legal cross-examinations, due to procedural stagnation caused by probabilistic generation.

Method: The proposed method, Soft-FSM, combines neuro-symbolic architecture with an external deterministic state controller to maintain monotonic progress over Key Information Units (KIUs).

Result: Experiments on real-world legal cases showed Soft-FSM achieving over 97% task completeness, outperforming baseline methods which collapse below 40% completeness.

Conclusion: LLMs alone cannot guarantee reliable completion of procedural tasks, but such reliability is achievable through explicit state control mechanisms like Soft-FSM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic fluency but struggle to reliably complete long-horizon tasks under explicit procedural constraints. In legal cross-examination, purely proba-bilistic generation often maintains behavioral coherence while failing to ensure procedural advancement. We characterize this failure as procedural stagnation and propose Soft-FSM, a neuro-symbolic architecture that enforces monotonic progress over accumulated Key Information Units (KIUs) via an external deterministic state controller. Experiments on three real-world Taiwanese criminal homicide cases show that baseline methods collapse below 40% completeness, while Soft-FSM consistently achieves over 97% with near-zero redundancy. These results suggest that, in such domains, reliable task completion cannot be guaranteed by emergent LLM behavior alone, and can be reliably enforced through explicit and verifiable external state control.

*Michael A. Lepori,Tal Linzen,Ann Yuan,Katja Filippova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores if large language models (LLMs) can effectively use in-context learned representations to handle novel tasks and finds that even state-of-the-art models struggle with flexible deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess whether LLMs can adapt their behaviors to radically new contexts after deployment by using in-context representations effectively.

Method: The authors evaluate both open-weight and closed-source LLMs on tasks like next-token prediction and adaptive world modeling to measure their ability to utilize in-context semantic representations.

Result: Results show that LLMs, including performant ones, often encode novel semantics in latent representations but fail to deploy them flexibly to complete downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are limited in leveraging novel in-context patterns effectively, pointing to the need for advancements enabling flexible deployment of learned representations.

Abstract: Though large language models (LLMs) have enabled great success across a wide variety of tasks, they still appear to fall short of one of the loftier goals of artificial intelligence research: creating an artificial system that can adapt its behavior to radically new contexts upon deployment. One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.
  We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context. Overall, this work seeks to inspire novel methods for encouraging models to not only encode information presented in-context, but to do so in a manner that supports flexible deployment of this information.

*Nuo Xu,Ahrii Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes different subword tokenization methods for NLP tasks, focusing on Uralic languages, and finds Overlap BPE (OBPE) to be more effective for morphological alignment and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how subword tokenization impacts morphologically rich and low-resource languages and improve NLP performance for these language types.

Method: Compared three tokenization paradigms (BPE, OBPE, and Unigram) across six Uralic languages using part-of-speech tagging as the evaluation task.

Result: OBPE consistently outperformed other methods in morphological alignment and tagging accuracy, especially in Latin-script languages, due to reduced fragmentation and better frequency balance.

Conclusion: Morphology-sensitive tokenization like OBPE is crucial for enabling cross-lingual transfer in agglutinative, low-resource languages, rather than being just a preprocessing step.

Abstract: Subword tokenization critically affects Natural Language Processing (NLP) performance, yet its behavior in morphologically rich and low-resource language families remains under-explored. This study systematically compares three subword paradigms -- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Overlap BPE (OBPE), and Unigram Language Model -- across six Uralic languages with varying resource availability and typological diversity. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity. Taken together, these findings highlight that morphology-sensitive tokenization is not merely a preprocessing choice but a decisive factor in enabling effective cross-lingual transfer for agglutinative, low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoLT, a framework that enhances the efficiency and accuracy of reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging latent reasoning through "tool calls" without exhaustive training or model structure changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of token-level reasoning chains and the limitations of existing latent reasoning methods that require extensive structural augmentations and training.

Method: Proposes CoLT, which generates seed tokens for reasoning steps in token space. When triggered, an external smaller model unpacks hidden states into explicit reasoning steps, improving reasoning efficiency while maintaining the main model's reasoning abilities.

Result: CoLT demonstrated higher accuracy and reduced reasoning length compared to baseline latent models on four mathematical datasets. It is also compatible with various reinforcement learning algorithms and decoder structures.

Conclusion: CoLT enhances reasoning in LLMs by balancing token-level explicit reasoning and latent efficiency, advancing reasoning performance without extensive model modifications.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a critical technique in enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and latent reasoning methods have been proposed to accelerate the inefficient token-level reasoning chain. We notice that existing latent reasoning methods generally require model structure augmentation and exhaustive training, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency. Experimental results on four mathematical datasets demonstrate that CoLT achieves higher accuracy and shorter reasoning length than baseline latent models, and is compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms and different decoder structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DementiaBank-Emotion, a corpus annotating emotional speech in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, revealing that AD speakers exhibit more non-neutral emotions compared to healthy controls, with notable acoustic differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a multi-rater annotated dataset for studying emotions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) speech and to enable research on emotional expression in AD populations.

Method: The paper annotates 1,492 utterances from 108 speakers, categorizing emotions per Ekman's six basic emotions plus neutrality. Acoustic analysis examines F0 modulation and loudness differences in AD and control speech.

Result: AD patients exhibit significantly higher non-neutral emotions than healthy controls; loudness differentiates emotion categories in AD. Control speakers show larger F0 changes for sadness, highlighting acoustic differences in emotional prosody.

Conclusion: The introduced corpus aids understanding of emotional expression and prosody in Alzheimer's disease and provides resources for research in clinical populations.

Abstract: We present DementiaBank-Emotion, the first multi-rater emotion annotation corpus for Alzheimer's disease (AD) speech. Annotating 1,492 utterances from 108 speakers for Ekman's six basic emotions and neutral, we find that AD patients express significantly more non-neutral emotions (16.9%) than healthy controls (5.7%; p < .001). Exploratory acoustic analysis suggests a possible dissociation: control speakers showed substantial F0 modulation for sadness (Delta = -3.45 semitones from baseline), whereas AD speakers showed minimal change (Delta = +0.11 semitones; interaction p = .023), though this finding is based on limited samples (sadness: n=5 control, n=15 AD) and requires replication. Within AD speech, loudness differentiates emotion categories, indicating partially preserved emotion-prosody mappings. We release the corpus, annotation guidelines, and calibration workshop materials to support research on emotion recognition in clinical populations.

### [46] [Scaling Agentic Verifier for Competitive Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04254)
*Zeyao Ma,Jing Zhang,Xiaokang Zhang,Jiaxi Yang,Zongmeng Zhang,Jiajun Zhang,Yuheng Jing,Lei Zhang,Hao Zheng,Wenting Zhao,Junyang Lin,Binyuan Hui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Agentic Verifier,' an execution-based tool for improving large language models' (LLMs) competitive programming problem-solving by actively identifying discriminative test inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong coding capabilities but struggle with competitive programming problems as they fail on single attempts. Existing execution-based re-ranking methods have limitations in input generation strategies for better testing.

Method: Proposes 'Agentic Verifier,' a reasoning agent that iteratively refines input generators by employing scalable methods like data synthesis, rejection-based fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

Result: The verifier achieves up to 10-15% improvements in competitive programming benchmarks' Best@K accuracy compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Agentic Verifier demonstrates enhanced coding performance in competitive programming problems while showcasing potential test-time scalability and broader applicability beyond reranking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong coding capabilities but still struggle to solve competitive programming problems correctly in a single attempt. Execution-based re-ranking offers a promising test-time scaling strategy, yet existing methods are constrained by either difficult test case generation or inefficient random input sampling. To address this limitation, we propose Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that actively reasons about program behaviors and searches for highly discriminative test inputs that expose behavioral discrepancies among candidate solutions. Through multi-turn interaction with code execution environments, the verifier iteratively refines the candidate input generator and produces targeted counterexamples rather than blindly sampling inputs. We train the verifier to acquire this discriminative input generation capability via a scalable pipeline combining large-scale data synthesis, rejection fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across five competitive programming benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong execution-based baselines, achieving up to +10-15% absolute gains in Best@K accuracy. Further analysis reveals clear test-time scaling behavior and highlights the verifier's broader potential beyond reranking.

*Jiarui Jin,Haoyu Wang,Xingliang Wu,Xiaocheng Fang,Xiang Lan,Zihan Wang,Deyun Zhang,Bo Liu,Yingying Zhang,Xian Wu,Hongyan Li,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECG-R1, an innovative reasoning MLLM designed to improve reliability in ECG interpretation by using novel methods and systematic evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models struggle with reliable ECG interpretation, frequently creating plausible but incorrect analysis, which necessitates a solution for trustworthy output.

Method: ECG-R1 leverages three innovations: protocol-guided instruction data generation for feature-based interpretation, interleaved modality dropout for improved robustness, and reinforcement learning with diagnostic evidence rewards for evidence-grounded interpretation.

Result: ECG-R1 improves reliability in ECG analysis through systematic evaluation, demonstrates widespread hallucination issues in current models, and suggests these models need independent verification for outputs.

Conclusion: ECG-R1 offers a significant step forward for reliable ECG interpretation in MLLMs, addressing issues of hallucination and robustness, with code and data openly available for further validation and utilization.

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) serves as an indispensable diagnostic tool in clinical practice, yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain unreliable for ECG interpretation, often producing plausible but clinically incorrect analyses. To address this, we propose ECG-R1, the first reasoning MLLM designed for reliable ECG interpretation via three innovations. First, we construct the interpretation corpus using \textit{Protocol-Guided Instruction Data Generation}, grounding interpretation in measurable ECG features and monograph-defined quantitative thresholds and diagnostic logic. Second, we present a modality-decoupled architecture with \textit{Interleaved Modality Dropout} to improve robustness and cross-modal consistency when either the ECG signal or ECG image is missing. Third, we present \textit{Reinforcement Learning with ECG Diagnostic Evidence Rewards} to strengthen evidence-grounded ECG interpretation. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the ECG interpretation capabilities of proprietary, open-source, and medical MLLMs, and provide the first quantitative evidence that severe hallucinations are widespread, suggesting that the public should not directly trust these outputs without independent verification. Code and data are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECG-R1}{here}, and an online platform can be accessed at \href{http://ai.heartvoice.com.cn/ECG-R1/}{here}.

### [48] [Contextual Drag: How Errors in the Context Affect LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04288)
*Yun Cheng,Xingyu Zhu,Haoyu Zhao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and investigates a phenomenon called contextual drag, where a model's past mistakes negatively impact its future performance, impeding self-improvement capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the potential issues in iterative self-refinement processes in LLMs, particularly the negative impact of past mistakes on current model performance and reasoning.

Method: The researchers evaluate 11 different models across 8 reasoning tasks, analyze structural reasoning errors using tree edit distance, and test mitigation strategies like fine-tuning and context denoising.

Result: Models suffer 10-20% performance drops due to contextual drag, inheriting structurally similar errors. Proposed mitigation strategies only yield partial improvements and cannot fully return performance to baseline.

Conclusion: Contextual drag is identified as a persistent failure mode in LLM architectures, highlighting the limitations of current self-refinement and reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Central to many self-improvement pipelines for large language models (LLMs) is the assumption that models can improve by reflecting on past mistakes. We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.

### [49] [Proxy Compression for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04289)
*Lin Zheng,Xinyu Li,Qian Liu,Xiachong Feng,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'proxy compression,' a training scheme where models handle both raw bytes and compressed inputs, leading to efficient learning without relying on fixed tokenizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of fixed tokenizers and enable language models to work directly on raw byte sequences for greater robustness and efficiency.

Method: Jointly train language models on both raw byte sequences and compressed inputs, allowing the models to internally align the representations for efficient learning and transfer between formats.

Result: Proxy compression improves training efficiency, outperforms pure byte-level baselines with fixed compute budgets, and matches tokenizer-based methods as model scale grows.

Conclusion: Proxy compression provides an efficient and robust approach for language modeling on raw bytes, eliminating dependency on fixed tokenizers while preserving scalability and performance.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.

### [50] [Guided Verifier: Collaborative Multimodal Reasoning via Dynamic Process Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04290)
*Lingzhuang Sun,Ruitong Liu,Yuxia Zhu,Xiaohan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Xiangxiang Zhang,Bihui Yu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Guided Verifier framework to address error propagation in reinforcement learning for multimodal large language models by using a dynamic verifier providing real-time feedback during rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for multimodal large language models rely on solitary rollout strategies, leading to unaddressed error propagation and noisy optimization signals.

Method: The Guided Verifier framework dynamically co-solves tasks with the model, using a verifier to detect inconsistencies and provide corrective signals. A specialized data pipeline generates the CoRe dataset for training.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that an 8B-parameter model, enhanced with collaborative inference and dynamic verification, achieves strong performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MMMU.

Conclusion: Dynamic verification and collaborative inference significantly improve the reasoning performance of multimodal models by addressing error propagation issues.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevailing paradigms typically rely on solitary rollout strategies where the model works alone. This lack of intermediate oversight renders the reasoning process susceptible to error propagation, where early logical deviations cascade into irreversible failures, resulting in noisy optimization signals. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy. During the rollout phase, this verifier interacts with the policy model in real-time, detecting inconsistencies and providing directional signals to steer the model toward valid trajectories. To facilitate this, we develop a specialized data synthesis pipeline targeting multimodal hallucinations, constructing \textbf{CoRe} dataset of process-level negatives and \textbf{Co}rrect-guide \textbf{Re}asoning trajectories to train the guided verifier. Extensive experiments on MathVista, MathVerse and MMMU indicate that by allocating compute to collaborative inference and dynamic verification, an 8B-parameter model can achieve strong performance.

### [51] [How Few-shot Demonstrations Affect Prompt-based Defenses Against LLM Jailbreak Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04294)
*Yanshu Wang,Shuaishuai Yang,Jingjing He,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how few-shot demonstrations interact with Role-Oriented (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) in defending against jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models, revealing differing effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role and impact of few-shot demonstrations when combined with prompt-based defenses (RoP and ToP) against jailbreak attacks on LLMs.

Method: The authors evaluated multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks using six jailbreak attack methods, analyzing the interaction between few-shot techniques and RoP/ToP strategies.

Result: Few-shot demonstrations improved RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% but degraded ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2%. These contrasting effects highlight the nuanced behavior of few-shot methods.

Conclusion: Few-shot demonstrations have varying impacts on prompt-based defenses, enhancing Role-Oriented Prompts while undermining Task-Oriented Prompts, leading to tailored recommendations for real-world deployments of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face increasing threats from jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment. While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications.

### [52] [Revisiting Prompt Sensitivity in Large Language Models for Text Classification: The Role of Prompt Underspecification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04297)
*Branislav Pecher,Michal Spiegel,Robert Belanec,Jan Cegin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the influence of underspecified vs. specifically instructed prompts on the sensitivity and performance of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the widely observed sensitivity in LLMs caused by variations in prompts, with a focus on understanding if prompt underspecification is a key contributor.

Method: The authors systematically compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and specific instruction-prompts using performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing methods.

Result: The study found that underspecified prompts lead to higher performance variance and weaker logit values. Specific instruction-prompts reduce these issues, though internal LLM representations are not significantly impacted, with changes emerging mainly in the final layers.

Conclusion: Prompt sensitivity in LLMs is significantly influenced by underspecification, emphasizing the importance of well-specified prompts for more consistent performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.

### [53] [DeFrame: Debiasing Large Language Models Against Framing Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04306)
*Kahee Lim,Soyeon Kim,Steven Euijong Whang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framing-aware debiasing method for large language models to reduce hidden biases caused by semantically equivalent prompt variations, improving fairness and robustness in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address hidden biases in LLMs that arise from variations in how semantically equivalent prompts are framed, ensuring fair and consistent responses across demographics.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of 'framing disparity' to analyze fairness evaluation under different prompt variations. They propose a framing-aware debiasing approach that encourages LLMs to remain consistent in responses across alternative framings.

Result: Results show that fairness scores vary based on prompt framing and existing debiasing techniques fail to address framing disparities. The proposed method reduces overall bias and increases robustness against these disparities.

Conclusion: The study highlights 'framing' as a significant factor contributing to fairness challenges in LLMs and offers a novel solution to mitigate framing disparities, resulting in fairer and more reliable model responses.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their fair responses across demographics has become crucial. Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., "A is better than B" vs. "B is worse than A") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of "framing disparity" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.

TL;DR: GutBrainIE is an advanced biomedical IE benchmark for extracting structured knowledge from scientific publications, especially in the gut-brain axis field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive, high-quality IE benchmark for biomedical research, addressing gaps in existing narrow or distantly annotated datasets.

Method: The study introduces 1,600 manually annotated PubMed abstracts focused on the gut-brain axis, featuring fine-grained entities, concept-level links, and relations.

Result: GutBrainIE provides a versatile benchmark with a rich schema combining curated and weakly supervised data for multiple IE tasks.

Conclusion: GutBrainIE supports the development of robust IE systems and enhances information extraction across biomedical domains.

Abstract: Information Extraction (IE), encompassing Named Entity Recognition (NER), Named Entity Linking (NEL), and Relation Extraction (RE), is critical for transforming the rapidly growing volume of scientific publications into structured, actionable knowledge. This need is especially evident in fast-evolving biomedical fields such as the gut-brain axis, where research investigates complex interactions between the gut microbiota and brain-related disorders. Existing biomedical IE benchmarks, however, are often narrow in scope and rely heavily on distantly supervised or automatically generated annotations, limiting their utility for advancing robust IE methods. We introduce GutBrainIE, a benchmark based on more than 1,600 PubMed abstracts, manually annotated by biomedical and terminological experts with fine-grained entities, concept-level links, and relations. While grounded in the gut-brain axis, the benchmark's rich schema, multiple tasks, and combination of highly curated and weakly supervised data make it broadly applicable to the development and evaluation of biomedical IE systems across domains.

*Sichu Liang,Hongyu Zhu,Wenwen Wang,Deyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates multimodal working memory by examining the performance of Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL in a spatial n-back task using both text-based and image-based representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how working memory functions with different modalities (visual vs. textual), especially in the context of complex vision-language models.

Method: The authors analyzed Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL models using spatial n-back tasks with grids rendered in text or image formats. They observed accuracy and response patterns, utilizing trial-wise probability evidence for deeper insights.

Result: The models performed better on text-based grids compared to image-based grids. It was also found that model performance aligned more with recent comparisons than with the instructed lag. Changes in grid size further influenced interference and errors.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations in multimodal working memory processing, prompting the need for nuanced interpretations of how vision-language models handle diverse representational codes.

Abstract: Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison. We further show that grid size alters recent-repeat structure in the stimulus stream, thereby changing interference and error patterns. These results motivate computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.

TL;DR: The paper combines ChemProt and DrugProt datasets to enhance chemical-gene interaction extraction, applying BioBERT and GCN integrated with BioBERT to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical-gene relationship extraction is critical for drug discovery, disease comprehension, and biomedical advancements. The authors aim to enhance data and model efficiency.

Method: Dataset merging of ChemProt and DrugProt to increase sample size. BioBERT and GCN integrated techniques are used for relationship extraction evaluation.

Result: Integrated datasets improve model performance significantly, especially in common CPR categories. Adding GCN boosts precision and recall for specific categories.

Conclusion: Enhancing datasets and incorporating global patterns with GCN integration improve chemical-gene relationship extraction accuracy and utility.

Abstract: The extraction of chemical-gene relations plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate interactions between chemical compounds and genes, with significant implications for drug discovery, disease understanding, and biomedical research. This paper presents a data set created by merging the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets to augment sample counts and improve model accuracy. We evaluate the merged dataset using two state of the art relationship extraction algorithms: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) specifically BioBERT, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) combined with BioBERT. While BioBERT excels at capturing local contexts, it may benefit from incorporating global information essential for understanding chemical-gene interactions. This can be achieved by integrating GCNs with BioBERT to harness both global and local context. Our results show that by integrating the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets, we demonstrated significant improvements in model performance, particularly in CPR groups shared between the datasets. Incorporating the global context using GCN can help increase the overall precision and recall in some of the CPR groups over using just BioBERT.

*Jie Deng,Hanshuang Tong,Jun Li,Shining Liang,Ning Wu,Hongzhi Li,Yutao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TrajFusion, a novel fine-tuning strategy for large language models, improves mathematical reasoning by incorporating structured supervision that adapts to teacher errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in training where current fine-tuning methods exclude reasoning failures, hindering the modeling process for trial-and-error reasoning in LLMs.

Method: TrajFusion adapts rejection sampling into a structured supervision framework by fusing correct reasoning trajectories with selected reasoning errors, adjusting trajectory length based on teacher error frequency and diversity.

Result: TrajFusion consistently outperformed conventional rejection fine-tuning across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, especially in handling complex, long-form reasoning problems.

Conclusion: TrajFusion enhances LLM fine-tuning by structurally integrating trial-and-error reasoning, leading to better performance on mathematical reasoning tasks without modifying model architecture.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in mathematical reasoning, often fine-tuned using rejection sampling that retains only correct reasoning trajectories. While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems.

*Isabel Tsintsiper,Sheng Wong,Beth Albert,Shaun P Brennecke,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning exhibited by large language models (LLMs) and their implications for healthcare integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about biases in LLMs trained on text corpora, particularly sex disparities in healthcare, prompted a study to explore biases in clinical decision-making.

Method: Using clinician-authored vignettes across 44 medical specialties, four general-purpose LLMs were tested for sex-assignment behaviors in diagnosis pathways, at temperature configuration 0.5.

Result: All tested LLMs displayed distinct sex biases, with varying female sex assignment rates: ChatGPT (70%), DeepSeek (61%), Claude (59%), and Gemini (36%). Permitting abstention reduced explicit sex labelling but did not mitigate downstream diagnostic biases.

Conclusion: Safe integration of LLMs in healthcare requires detailed configuration documentation, specialty-specific auditing, and proactive human oversight to address biases in clinical reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in healthcare workflows for documentation, education, and clinical decision support. However, these systems are trained on large text corpora that encode existing biases, including sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment, raising concerns that such patterns may be reproduced or amplified. We systematically examined whether contemporary LLMs exhibit sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning and how model configuration influences these behaviours. We conducted three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes spanning 44 specialties in which sex was non-informative to the initial diagnostic pathway. Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat). All models demonstrated significant sex-assignment skew, with predicted sex differing by model. At temperature 0.5, ChatGPT assigned female sex in 70% of cases (95% CI 0.66-0.75), DeepSeek in 61% (0.57-0.65) and Claude in 59% (0.55-0.63), whereas Gemini showed a male skew, assigning a female sex in 36% of cases (0.32-0.41). Contemporary LLMs exhibit stable, model-specific sex biases in clinical reasoning. Permitting abstention reduces explicit labelling but does not eliminate downstream diagnostic differences. Safe clinical integration requires conservative and documented configuration, specialty-level clinical data auditing, and continued human oversight when deploying general-purpose models in healthcare settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address rising fairness concerns due to social biases in outputs of large language models.

Method: Utilizes a stereotype-inducing word detection, neuron-level bias attribution using integrated gradients, and direct intervention in the projection layer to mitigate bias.

Result: The proposed method effectively reduces biases while maintaining model performance, demonstrated through experiments on three LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, effective approach to tackling biases in LLMs without compromising user experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Swordsman, an adaptive entropy-driven decoding framework for diffusion language models to improve efficiency and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving inference speed and quality in diffusion language models with better block partitioning and decoding strategies.

Method: The framework partitions blocks adaptively using entropy analysis and adjusts unmasking thresholds dynamically to align with semantic/syntactic boundaries.

Result: Swordsman achieves state-of-the-art performance in evaluations using KV Cache-support without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: Entropy-driven block adjustments and adaptive unmasking improve decoding efficiency and stability in DLMs, enhancing their application capabilities.

Abstract: Block-wise decoding effectively improves the inference speed and quality in diffusion language models (DLMs) by combining inter-block sequential denoising and intra-block parallel unmasking. However, existing block-wise decoding methods typically partition blocks in a rigid and fixed manner, which inevitably fragments complete semantic or syntactic constituents, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by the entropy reduction hypothesis (ERH), we recognize that constituent boundaries offer greater opportunities for uncertainty reduction, which motivates us to employ entropy analysis for identifying constituent boundaries. Therefore, we propose Swordsman, an entropy-driven adaptive block-wise decoding framework for DLMs. Swordsman adaptively partitions blocks by identifying entropy shifts between adjacent tokens to better align with semantic or syntactic constituent boundaries. In addition, Swordsman dynamically adjusts unmasking thresholds conditioned on the real-time unmasking status within a block, further improving both efficiency and stability. As a training-free framework, supported by KV Cache, Swordsman demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across extensive evaluations.

*Xinglong Yang,Zhilin Peng,Zhanzhan Liu,Haochen Shi,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the H-GIVR framework, which enhances multimodal reasoning by dynamically correcting errors and using historical information, improving accuracy at low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing self-consistency methods, which rely solely on fixed repeated sampling without leveraging historical reasoning information, and to enable models to dynamically adjust reasoning and correct visual errors.

Method: The proposed H-GIVR framework iteratively reasons by observing images multiple times and referencing previous outputs to dynamically adjust and correct errors in reasoning.

Result: H-GIVR significantly improves cross-modal reasoning accuracy, with notable results such as a 78.90% accuracy on the ScienceQA dataset (107% improvement over baseline) using Llama3.2-vision:11b, averaging 2.57 responses per question.

Conclusion: The H-GIVR framework effectively enhances reasoning accuracy in multimodal large language models while maintaining computational efficiency, showcasing its potential for cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: Self-consistency methods are the core technique for improving the reasoning reliability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. For instance, using \texttt{Llama3.2-vision:11b} on the ScienceQA dataset, the model requires an average of 2.57 responses per question to achieve an accuracy of 78.90\%, representing a 107\% improvement over the baseline.

### [62] [Fine-Grained Activation Steering: Steering Less, Achieving More](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04428)
*Zijian Feng,Tianjiao Li,Zixiao Zhu,Hanzhang Zhou,Junlang Qian,Li Zhang,Jia Jim Deryl Chua,Lee Onn Mak,Gee Wah Ng,Kezhi Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AUSteer proposes fine-grained activation steering at the atomic unit (AU) level in large language models, improving efficiency and precision over traditional block-level methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional block-level steering of activations in large language models is coarse and entangles beneficial and harmful features, reducing efficiency. This paper aims to address the heterogeneity in block-level activations for more precise modifications.

Method: The paper introduces AUSteer, which decomposes activations into atomic unit (AU)-level granularity. It identifies discriminative AUs using activation momenta on contrastive samples and applies adaptive steering tailored to inputs and AU activations.

Result: Experiments across multiple large language models and tasks show AUSteer outperforms advanced baselines, steering fewer activations while achieving superior results.

Conclusion: Precise steering at AU-level activations proves more effective and efficient, highlighting that modifying fewer activations can enhance model behavior considerably.

Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a cost-effective paradigm for modifying large language model (LLM) behaviors. Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.

*Masaya Tsunokake,Yuta Koreeda,Terufumi Morishita,Koichi Nagatsuka,Hikaru Tomonari,Yasuhiro Sogawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates micro domain-adaptive pre-training (mDAPT) for generative tasks in real-world operations, identifying its strengths and limitations in IT technical support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of micro domain-adaptive pre-training (mDAPT) for generative tasks in handling proprietary knowledge from micro domains in real-world enterprise operations.

Method: The authors decomposed the generative process into three subtasks: elicitation, reasoning, and composition, and evaluated mDAPT's performance on proprietary IT product knowledge in IT technical support scenarios.

Result: mDAPT improved elicitation tasks compared to the base model but struggled with reasoning and composition tasks.

Conclusion: mDAPT is effective in knowledge elicitation but requires enhancements in reasoning for better generative performance in real-world tasks.

Abstract: When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.

*Jinlong Ma,Yu Zhang,Xuefeng Bai,Kehai Chen,Yuwei Wang,Zeming Liu,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

TL;DR: This paper addresses modality bias in Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) using a novel Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning approach to improve cross-modal reasoning and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GMNER in an end-to-end manner while overcoming their inherent modality bias, which hampers effective cross-modal reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning (MCR), which incorporates Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) to transform constraints into reasoning chains and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO) to align reasoning trajectories dynamically.

Result: The proposed MCR approach mitigates modality bias and outperforms existing methods on GMNER and visual grounding tasks, achieving superior performance.

Conclusion: By addressing modality bias and encouraging structured cross-modal reasoning, MCR demonstrates its effectiveness and establishes a new direction for leveraging MLLMs in multimodal tasks like GMNER.

Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) aims to extract text-based entities, assign them semantic categories, and ground them to corresponding visual regions. In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.

*Dario Paape,Tal Linzen,Shravan Vasishth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mixture model to analyze human reading behavior using garden-path sentences and demonstrates its superiority over previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and quantify human reading behavior and processing costs when encountering garden-path sentences, aiming to improve existing predictive models.

Method: A latent-process mixture model was applied across four reading paradigms to distinguish between garden-path probability, cost, and reanalysis cost, while accounting for inattentive reading by some participants.

Result: The model successfully replicated reading behaviors like rereading and comprehension, outperformed GPT-2-based surprisal models using cross-validation, and provided realistic estimates of processing costs.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a more accurate representation of human reading patterns and could inform future research on reading comprehension and cognitive processes.

Abstract: Using temporarily ambiguous garden-path sentences ("While the team trained the striker wondered ...") as a test case, we present a latent-process mixture model of human reading behavior across four different reading paradigms (eye tracking, uni- and bidirectional self-paced reading, Maze). The model distinguishes between garden-path probability, garden-path cost, and reanalysis cost, and yields more realistic processing cost estimates by taking into account trials with inattentive reading. We show that the model is able to reproduce empirical patterns with regard to rereading behavior, comprehension question responses, and grammaticality judgments. Cross-validation reveals that the mixture model also has better predictive fit to human reading patterns and end-of-trial task data than a mixture-free model based on GPT-2-derived surprisal values. We discuss implications for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PersoDPO, a framework to improve persona-grounded dialogue systems by optimizing contextual coherence and personalization in LLMs, achieving superior results through automated preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source large language models still struggle with generating dialogue responses that are both contextually coherent and aligned with user personas, despite their general conversational prowess.

Method: A scalable optimization framework named PersoDPO is presented, which uses automatic evaluation signals (coherence, personalization, length-format compliance) to fine-tune dialogue models. It avoids manual annotations by constructing preference pairs automatically.

Result: Experiments on the FoCus dataset demonstrate that PersoDPO fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines and standard optimization techniques in several evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: PersoDPO showcases the potential of leveraging automated supervision signals to enhance the quality and personalization of dialogue systems without human effort, offering a scalable improvement pipeline.

Abstract: Personalization and contextual coherence are two essential components in building effective persona-grounded dialogue systems. These aspects play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement and ensuring responses are more relevant and consistent with user identity. However, recent studies indicate that open-source large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle to generate responses that are both contextually grounded and aligned with persona cues, despite exhibiting strong general conversational abilities like fluency and naturalness. We present PersoDPO, a scalable preference optimisation framework that uses supervision signals from automatic evaluations of responses generated by both closed-source and open-source LLMs to fine-tune dialogue models. The framework integrates evaluation metrics targeting coherence and personalization, along with a length-format compliance feature to promote instruction adherence. These signals are combined to automatically construct high-quality preference pairs without manual annotation, enabling a scalable and reproducible training pipeline. Experiments on the FoCus dataset show that an open-source language model fine-tuned with the PersoDPO framework consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines and a standard Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) variant across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Model-Dowser, a sparse fine-tuning method for MLLMs that mitigates catastrophic forgetting while being resource-efficient and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) without compromising scalability and resource efficiency.

Method: Model-Dowser assigns importance scores to model parameters, targeting high-importance parameters for preservation during fine-tuning while allowing less critical ones to update.

Result: Experimental results on LLaVA and NVILA models show that Model-Dowser improves performance by reducing catastrophic forgetting and outperforms previous methods.

Conclusion: Model-Dowser proves to be effective and efficient for task-specific fine-tuning of large-scale MLLMs, maintaining pretrained generalization and scalability.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on task-specific data is an effective way to improve performance on downstream applications. However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.

TL;DR: The paper explores a frame semantic-based method for detecting lexical semantic change and highlights its interpretability and effectiveness over neural embedding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of interpretability in neural embedding distributional representation models used for lexical semantic change detection.

Method: Proposing and evaluating a framework that relies on frame semantics for detecting lexical semantic change, rather than neural embedding models.

Result: The frame semantics-based method effectively detects semantic change, outperforming many distributional models while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: This alternative approach based on frame semantics is effective and offers a high degree of interpretability, making it a promising method for lexical semantic change detection.

Abstract: The majority of contemporary computational methods for lexical semantic change (LSC) detection are based on neural embedding distributional representations. Although these models perform well on LSC benchmarks, their results are often difficult to interpret. We explore an alternative approach that relies solely on frame semantics. We show that this method is effective for detecting semantic change and can even outperform many distributional semantic models. Finally, we present a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of its predictions, demonstrating that they are both plausible and highly interpretable

*Aditya Kasliwal,Pratinav Seth,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses implementing selective refusal policies for large language models entirely offline, proposing a circuit-restricted weight update method (C-Δθ).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM deployments need scalable safety policy enforcement, but current methods like activation steering require costly inference-time interventions.

Method: The paper introduces C-Δθ, which identifies sparse circuits responsible for specific refusals using EAP-IG and computes targeted weight updates only on those circuits (<5% of parameters), making refusal control deployable as a standard checkpoint.

Result: C-Δθ effectively delivers category-specific refusal selectivity without runtime steps and maintains model utility, verified via benchmarks.

Conclusion: Refusal-causal mechanisms can be integrated offline into LLMs using targeted weight updates, reducing runtime complexity and cost.

Abstract: Modern deployments require LLMs to enforce safety policies at scale, yet many controls rely on inference-time interventions that add recurring compute cost and serving complexity. Activation steering is widely used, but it requires runtime hooks and scales cost with the number of generations; conditional variants improve selectivity by gating when steering is applied but still retain an inference-time control path. We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint? We propose C-Δθ: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which (i) localizes refusal-causal computation as a sparse circuit using EAP-IG and (ii) computes a constrained weight update ΔθC supported only on that circuit (typically <5% of parameters). Applying ΔθC yields a drop-in edited checkpoint with no inference-time hooks, shifting cost from per-request intervention to a one-time offline update. We evaluate category-targeted selectivity and capability retention on refusal and utility benchmarks.

*Gang Lin,Dongfang Li,Zhuoen Chen,Yukun Shi,Xuhui Chen,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LycheeDecode, a method to tackle memory and latency challenges in large language models during long-context decoding by employing a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expanding key-value cache in long-context LLMs leads to memory and latency inefficiencies, and current mitigation strategies reduce model performance by not accounting for the functional roles of attention heads.

Method: LycheeDecode uses a HardKuma-based top-k selection mechanism to partition attention heads into retrieval and sparse subsets, dynamically identifying and reusing crucial tokens efficiently across decoding layers.

Result: LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to or better than full-attention models, with a speedup of up to 2.7x at 128K context length, validated across benchmarks like LongBench and OlympiadBench.

Conclusion: The method successfully preserves functional diversity of attention heads, addressing performance issues in prior approaches while enabling efficient, high-quality inference for long-context LLMs.

Abstract: The proliferation of long-context large language models (LLMs) exposes a key bottleneck: the rapidly expanding key-value cache during decoding, which imposes heavy memory and latency costs. While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.

*Jian Gu,Aldeida Aleti,Chunyang Chen,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method called Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT) is introduced to improve weight tying in compact language models for stable token interfaces during training and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weight-tying in language models can cause instability in token interfaces, making optimization and post-training processes unpredictable.

Method: PIT ensures consistent embedding and unembedding through shared latent token memory with orthonormal properties, while synchronizing hidden states using a symmetric positive definite transform.

Result: PIT improved training stability, enhanced semantic consistency across layers, and reduced side effects in on-device models across various sizes.

Conclusion: PIT introduces a refined weight-tying approach, providing more predictable and stable token interactions in language models.

Abstract: Weight tying is widely used in compact language models to reduce parameters by sharing the token table between the input embedding and the output projection. However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters. We evaluate PIT on on-device models spanning 256M-1.3B parameters across pretraining and adaptation, and consistently observe improved training stability, stronger layerwise semantic consistency, and substantially reduced side effects.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmbedPlan introduces a faster planning method by replacing token-by-token LLM generation with a lightweight transition model. It predicts the next states in embedding spaces without requiring encoder fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional planning with LLMs is slow due to token-by-token generation and repeated computations. This limits efficiency for multi-step planning and rollouts in real-time scenarios.

Method: EmbedPlan models language-based states and actions as embeddings, predicts the next state embedding using lightweight models, and retrieves the next state via similarity without fine-tuning language encoders.

Result: The framework achieves near-perfect performance on interpolated tasks but struggles to generalize effectively in unseen domains or problems, indicating the bottleneck in cross-domain transfer.

Conclusion: EmbedPlan showcases an efficient approach to within-domain planning using frozen embeddings; however, further work is needed to enhance generalization across domains.

Abstract: Planning with LLMs is bottlenecked by token-by-token generation and repeated full forward passes, making multi-step lookahead and rollout-based search expensive in latency and compute. We propose EmbedPlan, which replaces autoregressive next-state generation with a lightweight transition model operating in a frozen language embedding space. EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories. Overall, frozen embeddings support within-domain dynamics learning after observing a domain's transitions, while transfer across domain boundaries remains a bottleneck.

### [74] [Can LLMs capture stable human-generated sentence entropy measures?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04570)
*Estrella Pivel-Villanueva,Elisabeth Frederike Sterner,Franziska Knolle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the stability of entropy estimates in language comprehension and compares human-derived entropy data with large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o. Findings show that stable entropy values can be achieved with a defined number of responses, but LLMs are not perfect substitutes for human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the mechanisms of language comprehension using Shannon entropy, focusing on the stability of entropy estimates from human responses and the comparability of these estimates with those from LLMs.

Method: A bootstrap-based convergence analysis was used on two large cloze datasets in German and English to measure entropy stability as a function of sample size. The entropy values derived from human participants were then compared with estimates from LLMs like GPT-4o and others, using different probability extraction methods.

Result: More than 97% of sentences achieved stable entropy estimates, with convergence requiring fewer responses for predictable sentences. GPT-4o showed the closest alignment with human entropy values, depending on the method used for deriving estimates.

Conclusion: The findings validate norming practices in entropy estimation and demonstrate that while LLMs like GPT-4o approximate human-derived entropy values, they cannot fully replicate human variability or distributions.

Abstract: Predicting upcoming words is a core mechanism of language comprehension and may be quantified using Shannon entropy. There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability. Together, our results establish practical guidelines for human norming and show that while LLMs can approximate human entropy, they are not interchangeable with stable human-derived distributions.

### [75] [Semantic Self-Distillation for Language Model Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04577)
*Edward Phillips,Sean Wu,Boyan Gao,David A. Clifton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD) distills semantic dispersion into lightweight models for uncertainty quantification in large language models. It enables efficient semantic uncertainty estimation without latency concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and diversity in the outputs of large language models make traditional uncertainty quantification methods impractical, especially in latency-critical environments. A proxy based on semantic dispersion has proven useful, but computational costs remain a challenge.

Method: The paper proposes Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD) to distill sampled semantic distributions from a language model into a lightweight student model that evaluates uncertainty before answer generation. This model predicts semantic distributions and uses entropy and probability density for reliable uncertainty signals.

Result: SSD achieves effective hallucination prediction, matching or surpassing traditional semantic dispersion methods on TriviaQA and provides strong indicators for detecting out-of-domain answers.

Conclusion: SSD offers a framework for efficient predictive uncertainty in large language models, extending utility beyond language to other complex output spaces.

Abstract: Large language models present challenges for principled uncertainty quantification, in part due to their complexity and the diversity of their outputs. Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection. We term this technique Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD), which we suggest provides a general framework for distilling predictive uncertainty in complex output spaces beyond language.

Conclusion: It demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating multimodal and collaborative approaches in fact-checking, showcasing the potential of VILLAIN in real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper describes VILLAIN, a multimodal fact-checking system that verifies image-text claims through prompt-based multi-agent collaboration. For the AVerImaTeC shared task, VILLAIN employs vision-language model agents across multiple stages of fact-checking. Textual and visual evidence is retrieved from the knowledge store enriched through additional web collection. To identify key information and address inconsistencies among evidence items, modality-specific and cross-modal agents generate analysis reports. In the subsequent stage, question-answer pairs are produced based on these reports. Finally, the Verdict Prediction agent produces the verification outcome based on the image-text claim and the generated question-answer pairs. Our system ranked first on the leaderboard across all evaluation metrics. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ssu-humane/VILLAIN.

*Lucile Favero,Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz,Tanja Käser,Nuria Oliver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving automated essay scoring for argumentative writing by providing trait-level feedback using structured learning with LLMs and a BigBird model optimized for educational use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the pedagogical usefulness of essay scoring systems by providing interpretable feedback aligned with educational rubrics, especially for complex essay genres like argumentative writing.

Method: Two methods are studied: (1) in-context learning with small open-source LLMs using rubric-aligned examples, and (2) a supervised BigBird model utilizing CORAL-style ordinal regression for long-sequence understanding.

Result: Explicitly modeling score ordinality improves alignment with human raters, BigBird outperforms LLMs overall, while small LLMs perform well on reasoning traits without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of matching model objectives with rubric semantics, showcasing both the practical and modeling potential of trait-based feedback systems for educational purposes.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring systems have traditionally focused on holistic scores, limiting their pedagogical usefulness, especially in the case of complex essay genres such as argumentative writing. In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios. Our findings provide methodological, modeling, and practical insights for the design of AI-based educational systems that aim to deliver interpretable, rubric-aligned feedback for argumentative writing.

### [78] [RexBERT: Context Specialized Bidirectional Encoders for E-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04605)
*Rahul Bajaj,Anuj Garg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RexBERT is introduced as a family of BERT-style encoders tailored for e-commerce semantics, outperforming larger general-purpose models using specialized training and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose encoders fail to adequately address specialized domains like e-commerce where stability, latency, and cost are critical.

Method: The authors propose a modular pipeline for corpus extraction (Ecom-niverse), employ a refined pretraining recipe with phased specialization, and develop RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters.

Result: RexBERT surpasses larger general-purpose and long-context models in e-commerce-specific benchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of domain-specialized training.

Conclusion: Specialized training using high-quality domain-specific data offers a stronger foundation for applications like e-commerce compared to scaling generic models alone.

Abstract: Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.

*Junhao Liu,Haonan Yu,Zhenyu Yan,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Focus-LIME, a framework that improves feature-level interpretations for large language models handling massive context windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to achieve precise, feature-level explanations for large language models in high-stakes tasks is hindered by existing methods' failures in scenarios with high feature dimensionality.

Method: Focus-LIME employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, using a proxy model to optimize the perturbation neighborhood and enable the target model to perform focused attribution.

Result: Empirical evaluations validate that Focus-LIME restores tractability for surgical interpretations and generates faithful explanations on long-context benchmarks.

Conclusion: Focus-LIME enables effective and faithful feature-level model explanations, filling the gap in long-context, high-dimensional scenarios faced by existing methods.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to handle massive context windows, achieving surgical feature-level interpretation is essential for high-stakes tasks like legal auditing and code debugging. However, existing local model-agnostic explanation methods face a critical dilemma in these scenarios: feature-based methods suffer from attribution dilution due to high feature dimensionality, thus failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework designed to restore the tractability of surgical interpretation. Focus-LIME utilizes a proxy model to curate the perturbation neighborhood, allowing the target model to perform fine-grained attribution exclusively within the optimized context. Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations to users.

*Théo Lasnier,Armel Zebaze,Djamé Seddah,Rachel Bawden,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how neural networks within Large Language Models handle machine translation through mechanistic analyses, pinpointing specific attention heads for translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of detailed understanding of how Large Language Models perform machine translation, particularly beyond a word-level scope.

Method: The authors analyzed attention heads in neural networks, decomposed MT into two subtasks, and examined their distinct functions across various translation scenarios.

Result: Sparse sets of specialized attention heads were found for translation subtasks, and modifying just 1% of these heads allowed comparable performance to instruction-based prompting.

Conclusion: Focused manipulation of certain attention heads can effectively steer MT performance, shedding light on the internal workings of large-scale models.

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) seeks to explain how neural networks implement their capabilities, but the scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has limited prior MI work in Machine Translation (MT) to word-level analyses. We study sentence-level MT from a mechanistic perspective by analyzing attention heads to understand how LLMs internally encode and distribute translation functions. We decompose MT into two subtasks: producing text in the target language (i.e. target language identification) and preserving the input sentence's meaning (i.e. sentence equivalence). Across three families of open-source models and 20 translation directions, we find that distinct, sparse sets of attention heads specialize in each subtask. Based on this insight, we construct subtask-specific steering vectors and show that modifying just 1% of the relevant heads enables instruction-free MT performance comparable to instruction-based prompting, while ablating these heads selectively disrupts their corresponding translation functions.

### [81] [LEAD: Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding for Faithful Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04617)
*Ruixiao Yang,Yuanhe Tian,Xu Yang,Huiqi Li,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method, LEAD, to improve radiology report generation by addressing hallucinations and decoding biases in large vision language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Radiology Report Generation struggles with hallucinations and biases, as existing methods lack robustness and fail to address inherent model alignment issues.

Method: LEAD introduces a layer-wise decoding architecture that integrates expert-extracted pathological features into each decoder layer through a learned gating mechanism.

Result: LEAD effectively improves clinical accuracy and mitigates hallucinations compared to existing methods, maintaining high-quality generation.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates the potential to advance radiology reporting by enhancing factual consistency and reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to produce accurate and coherent diagnostics from medical images. Although large vision language models (LVLM) improve report fluency and accuracy, they exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet image-ungrounded pathological details. Existing methods primarily rely on external knowledge guidance to facilitate the alignment between generated text and visual information. However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the LEAD method yields effective improvements in clinical accuracy metrics and mitigates hallucinations while preserving high generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates using embedding models to analyze large text datasets, focusing on scientific publications in the Web of Science dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new benefits of Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings in handling text semantics and relationships in massive datasets.

Method: Using embedding techniques on the Web of Science dataset (~56 million scientific publications) to analyze and reveal a structured landscape of texts.

Result: The analysis revealed a self-structured landscape, showcasing the potential of the proposed embedding method on such datasets.

Conclusion: Embedding models are effective for analyzing large text datasets since they provide meaningful insights into text semantics and relationships.

Abstract: Large text data sets, such as publications, websites, and other text-based media, inherit two distinct types of features: (1) the text itself, its information conveyed through semantics, and (2) its relationship to other texts through links, references, or shared attributes. While the latter can be described as a graph structure and can be handled by a range of established algorithms for classification and prediction, the former has recently gained new potential through the use of LLM embedding models. Demonstrating these possibilities and their practicability, we investigate the Web of Science dataset, containing ~56 million scientific publications through the lens of our proposed embedding method, revealing a self-structured landscape of texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses deceptive alignment in Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge by introducing Rationale Consistency, a metric capturing alignment between reasoning and human judgment, achieving superior results using a hybrid training method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models prioritize Outcome Accuracy during training, leading to deceptive alignment where models provide correct answers for incorrect reasons. This undermines their generalizability and effectiveness, especially during reward model tasks like RLHF.

Method: The authors introduce Rationale Consistency as a new metric for evaluating a model's reasoning alignment with human judgment. They combine this metric with outcome accuracy in a hybrid training approach for Generative Reward Models.

Result: The proposed method surpasses outcome-only baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), with improved generalization and enhanced rationale consistency detected through their analysis. Tasks like creative writing saw a notable performance boost.

Conclusion: Incorporating Rationale Consistency mitigates deceptive alignment, enhances generalization, and boosts training effectiveness. The introduced hybrid approach outperforms traditional methods, particularly in creative and reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge exhibit deceptive alignment by producing correct judgments for incorrect reasons, as they are trained and evaluated to prioritize Outcome Accuracy, which undermines their ability to generalize during RLHF. We introduce Rationale Consistency, a fine-grained metric that quantifies the alignment between the model's reasoning process and human judgment. Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training.

Method: The study employs traditional algorithms, supervised machine learning models optimized with artificial bee colony techniques, and evaluates third-party tools such as CloudNLP, OpenAI embeddings, GPT-4, and SlovakBERT.

Result: The paper highlights the trade-offs between the different evaluated STS approaches for the Slovak language.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the effectiveness and limitations of various STS methods for an under-resourced language like Slovak, aiding in the selection of suitable approaches.

Abstract: Semantic textual similarity (STS) plays a crucial role in many natural language processing tasks. While extensively studied in high-resource languages, STS remains challenging for under-resourced languages such as Slovak. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of sentence-level STS methods applied to Slovak, including traditional algorithms, supervised machine learning models, and third-party deep learning tools. We trained several machine learning models using outputs from traditional algorithms as features, with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning jointly guided by artificial bee colony optimization. Finally, we evaluated several third-party tools, including fine-tuned model by CloudNLP, OpenAI's embedding models, GPT-4 model, and pretrained SlovakBERT model. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between different approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and analyze the underrepresentation or biased representation of disabilities in AI-generated images as compared to other social groups, aiming to address inclusivity in generative models.

Method: The study uses structured prompt designs to compare generic versus specific disability prompts, sentiment polarity analysis to assess affective framing, and combines automatic and human evaluations to analyze representations.

Result: The research reveals persistent imbalances in how disabilities are portrayed, pointing to systemic issues in AI generative models' representation of disability.

Conclusion: The findings underline the necessity for continuous evaluation and refinement of generative models to achieve diverse and inclusive portrayals of disabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have made remarkable progress in producing high-quality visual content from textual descriptions, yet concerns remain about how they represent social groups. While characteristics like gender and race have received increasing attention, disability representations remain underexplored. This study investigates how people with disabilities are represented in AI-generated images by analyzing outputs from Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 using a structured prompt design. We analyze disability representations by comparing image similarities between generic disability prompts and prompts referring to specific disability categories. Moreover, we evaluate how mitigation strategies influence disability portrayals, with a focus on assessing affective framing through sentiment polarity analysis, combining both automatic and human evaluation. Our findings reveal persistent representational imbalances and highlight the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of generative models to foster more diverse and inclusive portrayals of disability.

*Yuan Zhang,Thales Bertaglia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LinGO, a framework for improving large language models' detection of uncivil language by focusing on linguistic structures and optimization, achieving promising results in political incivility classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of current tools in accurately identifying uncivil language intent, particularly when uncivil cues are present but do not imply harmful intent.

Method: LinGO uses linguistic graph optimization to decompose language into multi-step linguistic components, identify areas causing errors, and iteratively optimize prompts or components. Four optimization techniques and three cost-efficient models were benchmarked.

Result: LinGO significantly enhanced accuracy and weighted F1 across all considered models and techniques. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Gemini model outperformed others.

Conclusion: LinGO successfully optimizes LLM instructions using multi-step linguistic approaches to better interpret complex semantic meanings, holding potential for broader applications in semantically complex tasks.

Abstract: Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.

Motivation: The study aims to unify multimodal tasks into one model for understanding and generating across text, image, video, and audio, addressing the lack of scalable, versatile models suitable for diverse resource constraints.

Method: ERNIE 5.0 adopts a unified next-token prediction objective with ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) and elastic training to balance model performance, size, and inference latency in multimodal contexts.

Result: ERNIE 5.0 demonstrates strong, balanced multimodal performance using its trillion-parameter architecture and is the first publicly disclosed model of such scale for multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: ERNIE 5.0's novel designs in multimodal modeling and training offer both practical deployment flexibility and significant insights, setting a new benchmark in unified autoregressive foundation models.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.

### [88] [LiteToken: Removing Intermediate Merge Residues From BPE Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04706)
*Yike Sun,Haotong Yang,Zhouchen Lin,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies inefficiencies in BPE tokenizers and introduces LiteToken to remove seldom-used tokens, improving vocabulary efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization in BPE models has been underexplored compared to architectures and training, and inefficiencies lead to wasted capacity and vulnerability.

Method: Investigates BPE vocabularies for intermediate merge residues and presents LiteToken, a method to remove rarely-used tokens efficiently.

Result: LiteToken improves tokenization by reducing fragmentation, lowering parameter counts, and enhancing robustness without compromising performance.

Conclusion: Removing rarely-used tokens with LiteToken improves tokenizer efficiency and model robustness, often without the need for further fine-tuning.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental to how language models represent and process text, yet the behavior of widely used BPE tokenizers has received far less study than model architectures and training. In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens. Because the affected tokens are rarely used, pretrained models can often accommodate the modified tokenizer without additional fine-tuning. Experiments show that LiteToken reduces token fragmentation, reduces parameters, and improves robustness to noisy or misspelled inputs, while preserving overall performance.

### [89] [Linguistically Informed Evaluation of Multilingual ASR for African Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04716)
*Fei-Yueh Chen,Lateef Adeleke,C. M. Downey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques WER as an inaccurate metric for evaluating ASR models in African languages and introduces FER and TER to better capture linguistically meaningful errors, particularly phonological and tonal challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of Word Error Rate (WER) as an evaluation metric for ASR models in African languages, focusing on mischaracterization of phonological, tonal, and other linguistic errors.

Method: The researchers evaluated three speech encoders on Yoruba and Uneme languages using WER, CER, FER, and a tone-aware FER extension (TER) to compare lexical, phonological, and tonal errors.

Result: The study highlights significant gaps in linguistic error representation across metrics. For Yoruba: WER=0.788, CER=0.305, FER=0.151; for Uneme: WER is nearly perfect but CER=0.461 and FER=0.267 still highlight challenges, particularly with tonal aspects.

Conclusion: FER and TER metrics allow a deeper and more accurate understanding of ASR model errors, especially in phonological and tonal features, which WER often fails to capture. These findings underscore the need to adopt linguistically meaningful metrics for African languages.

Abstract: Word Error Rate (WER) mischaracterizes ASR models' performance for African languages by combining phonological, tone, and other linguistic errors into a single lexical error. By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267. This indicates model error is often attributable to individual phonetic feature errors, which is obscured by all-or-nothing metrics like WER.

*Madison Van Doren,Casey Ford,Jennifer Barajas,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper establishes a new human evaluation benchmark for cultural localisation in machine translations created by multilingual large language models, evaluating seven models with native-language raters across cultural nuances such as idioms and puns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine translation benchmarks mainly target grammatical accuracy but fail to address the cultural and pragmatic subtleties crucial for effective localisation, which this study seeks to highlight.

Method: The study assessed 7 multilingual large language models (LLMs) across 15 languages using native speaker raters. They rated both full-text translations and culturally nuanced phrases (e.g., idioms, puns) using an ordinal quality scale, including an 'NA' option for untranslated content.

Result: Results show moderate translation quality overall (mean score 1.68/3), with GPT-5 achieving the highest scores. Cultural categories like holidays were better translated than idioms and puns, which frequently went untranslated.

Conclusion: The research highlights a significant gap in cultural nuance handling by current LLMs despite their grammatical proficiency, emphasizing the importance of culturally informed training and evaluation methods for realistic translation applications.

Abstract: We present a large-scale human evaluation benchmark for assessing cultural localisation in machine translation produced by state-of-the-art multilingual large language models (LLMs). Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.
  Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual, human-annotated benchmark focused explicitly on cultural nuance in translation and localisation, highlighting the need for culturally informed training data, improved cross-lingual pragmatics, and evaluation paradigms that better reflect real-world communicative competence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the modular STM framework to optimize retrieval-augmented generation for specialized domains like biomedicine with substantial performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the technical challenges of adapting general-purpose LLMs into domain-specific retrievers, particularly in specialized domains such as biomedicine.

Method: Propose the Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM) framework, incorporating synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging to enhance decoder-only LLMs.

Result: STM improved task-specific performance with up to 23.5% increase on specialized tasks and generated models that outperform both single experts and baselines.

Conclusion: STM offers an efficient way to turn general LLMs into domain-specialized retrievers without extensive pretraining, maintaining general-domain capabilities while excelling in specialized domains.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the backbone of grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), improving knowledge updates and reducing hallucinations. Recently, LLM-based retriever models have shown state-of-the-art performance for RAG applications. However, several technical aspects remain underexplored on how to adapt general-purpose LLMs into effective domain-specific retrievers, especially in specialized domains such as biomedicine. We present Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM), a modular framework that enhances decoder-only LLMs with synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging. Experiments on a subset of 12 medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark show STM boosts task-specific experts by up to 23.5\% (average 7.5\%) and produces merged models that outperform both single experts and strong baselines without extensive pretraining. Our results demonstrate a scalable, efficient path for turning general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, preserving general-domain capabilities while excelling on specialized tasks.

*Casey Ford,Madison Van Doren,Emily Dix*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on their safety under adversarial prompts, using human harm ratings and benchmarks across generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address gaps in understanding the safety and robustness of MLLMs in real-world systems under adversarial conditions.

Method: A two-phase evaluation using 726 adversarial prompts across model generations and multimodal benchmarks, with human harm ratings.

Result: Large and persistent safety differences were observed among models; Pixtral models were highly vulnerable while Claude models were safer. Generational updates affected attack success rates and modalities differently.

Conclusion: MLLM harmlessness varies over time and updates, emphasizing the importance of ongoing, multimodal safety evaluations.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.

*Arman Engin Sucu,Yixiang Zhou,Mario A. Nascimento,Tony Mullen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in detecting political stance using user profile summaries for context, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve political stance detection in informal, complex online discourse by leveraging contextual user profiles, overcoming challenges like sarcasm, ambiguity, and language dependence.

Method: The study employed real-world data from political forums, using structured user profiles summarizing ideological leanings, topics, and linguistic patterns, and evaluated seven LLMs in baseline and context-rich conditions.

Result: Incorporating contextual user profiles led to accuracy improvements of +17.5% to +38.5%, achieving up to 74% accuracy. Optimized post selection strategies enhanced results further.

Conclusion: Adding user-level context significantly improves political stance classification in LLMs, showcasing the importance of strategically selected contextual data for nuanced tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for political stance detection in informal online discourse, where language is often sarcastic, ambiguous, and context-dependent. We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\% to +38.5\%, achieving up to 74\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts. These findings underscore the value of incorporating user-level context to enhance LLM performance in nuanced political classification tasks.

### [94] [When Silence Is Golden: Can LLMs Learn to Abstain in Temporal QA and Beyond?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04755)
*Xinyu Zhou,Chang Jin,Carsten Eickhoff,Zhijiang Guo,Seyed Ali Bahrainian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to train large language models (LLMs) to admit uncertainty, particularly in temporal question answering (QA), by combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision and Reinforcement Learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs tend to confidently generate misleading answers instead of acknowledging uncertainty, especially in temporal reasoning, where facts may vary with time.

Method: The authors combine CoT supervision with RL that incorporates abstention-aware rewards, aiming to teach abstention as a skill while systematically studying its impact on temporal QA.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in reasoning accuracy and unanswerable question handling, outperforming models like GPT-4o by significant margins in Exact Match evaluations. However, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is shown to cause overconfidence, while RL reduces this but doesn't eliminate the risk.

Conclusion: Optimizing for both reasoning and abstention in LLMs improves reliability and accuracy, paving the way for more trustworthy and capable models in the future.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\%$ and $5.80\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.

*Luis Frentzen Salim,Esteban Carlin,Alexandre Morinvil,Xi Ai,Lun-Wei Ku*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the potential of scaling in-context learning (ICL) for low-resource machine translation (MT), exploring its limits and effectiveness. It demonstrates that performance gains from additional context size saturate quickly and depend heavily on the type of training corpora used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting large language models (LLMs) for low-resource language translation, specifically by leveraging the potential of in-context learning (ICL).

Method: The paper investigates scaling ICL for MT models to context sizes up to 1 million tokens. It compares the effects of three different types of training corpora: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data for Javanese and Sundanese languages.

Result: Findings indicate that the effectiveness of larger context windows depends on the corpus type, with performance saturating quickly and even degrading near the maximum context windows. Some monolingual data types perform competitively with parallel data.

Conclusion: Scaling ICL context size does not guarantee proportional quality improvements in low-resource MT, and corpus type plays a significant role in determining the outcomes.

Abstract: Building machine translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages is notably difficult due to the scarcity of high-quality data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniSIFT is a token compression framework for Omni-modal Large Language Models, which reduces computational overhead by retaining only 25% of the original token context while improving model performance on audio-video tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Omni-LLMs face significant computational challenges due to long multimodal token sequences, and current token compression methods are limited in addressing this issue.

Method: The paper introduces OmniSIFT, which uses a two-stage modality-asymmetric compression. It includes a spatio-temporal video pruning module and a vision-guided audio selection module. The framework is optimized end-to-end with a differentiable straight-through estimator.

Result: OmniSIFT demonstrates improved efficacy and robustness on benchmarks, introducing minimal additional parameters and achieving lower latency while outperforming both compression baselines and full-token models in multiple tasks.

Conclusion: OmniSIFT effectively addresses computational overhead in Omni-LLMs through efficient token compression, offering high performance with reduced context size and minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.

*Jiarui Yuan,Tailin Jin,Weize Chen,Zeyuan Liu,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SE-Bench, a testing environment for evaluating agents' ability to internalize and utilize knowledge. It identifies challenges, experiments with coded tasks, and provides insights into methods for better knowledge retention and self-evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously measure and improve agents' capability to internalize novel knowledge and use it to solve future tasks, overcoming issues like entanglement of prior knowledge and reasoning complexity.

Method: A novel diagnostic environment, SE-Bench, was created with obfuscated NumPy functionalities. Evaluation was performed under the constraint of no-reference documentation on coding tasks. Three key challenges were analyzed through the study.

Result: Insights were discovered on overcoming the Open-Book Paradox (training with references fails retention), addressing RL's inefficiencies due to PPO clipping, and validating Self-Play with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for self-evolution of models.

Conclusion: SE-Bench provides rigorous ways to test and achieve self-evolution in agents by forcing knowledge compression and introducing better methods like Self-Play with SFT over traditional RL.

Abstract: True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores reliability in large language models' closed-book question answering, focusing on decomposition prompting and a training-free error detection strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often hallucinate confidently in question answering, risking reliability. The paper investigates whether decomposed prompting can signal model uncertainty and improve error detection.

Method: The authors evaluate Direct, Assistive, and Incremental prompting across model scales and benchmarks, using cross-regime agreement as a measure of uncertainty detection.

Result: Disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty methods, showing improved error detection across F1 and AUROC metrics without fine-tuning or retrieval.

Conclusion: Decomposition prompting can enhance reliability assessment for large language models' closed-book QA, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying errors effectively.

Abstract: Large language models often struggle to recognize their knowledge limits in closed-book question answering, leading to confident hallucinations. While decomposed prompting is typically used to improve accuracy, we investigate its impact on reliability. We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings. This demonstrates that decomposition-based prompting can serve as a practical diagnostic probe for model reliability in closed-book QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals that even when Large Language Models (LLMs) refuse harmful requests during fake news generation, their internal reasoning may still harbor unsafe narratives. It introduces a framework to analyze and mitigate these risks in the reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing assessments assume that refusal to harmful requests means safe reasoning, overlooking potential risks in the reasoning process of LLMs.

Method: The researchers propose a safety-analysis framework using Jacobian-based spectral metrics to decompose and evaluate attention heads during chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Experiments reveal heightened risks during activated thinking modes, largely driven by specific mid-depth attention layers in LLMs.

Conclusion: Refusing harmful requests does not ensure safety in reasoning; identifying and addressing critical reasoning components like attention heads is key to mitigating risks.

Abstract: From generating headlines to fabricating news, the Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically assessed by their final outputs, under the safety assumption that a refusal response signifies safe reasoning throughout the entire process. Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.

TL;DR: Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL) uses policy-gradient optimization on attention distributions to improve multimodal reasoning in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training methods for MLLMs using verbose rationales have limited effectiveness and can degrade multimodal perception performance.

Method: RAL optimizes internal attention distributions instead of token sequences, shifting focus to where the model attends within multimodal inputs; it also introduces On-Policy Attention Distillation for better cross-modal alignment.

Result: RAL consistently outperforms baselines, including GRPO, across diverse image and video benchmarks in terms of improved multimodal grounding and reasoning.

Conclusion: Attention policies provide a general and principled approach for advancing multimodal post-training in LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.
  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic survey on intellectual property (IP) protection in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for real-time 3D scene synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing commercial value and explicit parametric nature of 3DGS raise concerns about its intellectual property (IP) protection, especially given its rising use in key applications and emerging generative AI threats.

Method: The authors introduce a bottom-up framework that analyzes Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, passive and active protection paradigms, and robustness threats to systematically address IP protection gaps in 3DGS.

Result: The survey uncovers gaps in technical IP protection foundations, robustness challenges in generative AI contexts, and provides a structured understanding of the current landscape of 3DGS IP protection.

Conclusion: Several research directions are proposed focusing on robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms to ensure reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a mainstream representation for real-time 3D scene synthesis, enabling applications in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and 3D content creation. Its rising commercial value and explicit parametric structure raise emerging intellectual property (IP) protection concerns, prompting a surge of research on 3DGS IP protection. However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.

### [102] [TruKAN: Towards More Efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Using Truncated Power Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03879)
*Ali Bayeh,Samira Sadaoui,Malek Mouhoub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TruKAN is a novel neural architecture based on KAN principles with learnable activation functions, aiming to optimize accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the trade-off between computational efficiency and the expressiveness of KAN while also enhancing interpretability and maintaining adherence to KAN principles.

Method: TruKAN replaces B-spline bases in KAN with k-order truncated power functions and integrates this architecture within an EfficientNet-V2 framework, using hybrid optimization and investigating layer normalization techniques.

Result: TruKAN achieves superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage compared to KAN and its variants on computer vision benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TruKAN effectively balances computational efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability, outperforming existing KAN models and demonstrating scalability beyond prior KAN applications.

Abstract: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles, we propose TruKAN, a new architecture based on the KAN structure and learnable activation functions. TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN. Overall, TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and memory usage on the complex vision task, demonstrating advantages beyond the limited settings explored in prior KAN studies.

*Maxx Richard Rahman,Mostafa Hammouda,Wolfgang Maass*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGAN, a novel Diffusion-Guided Attention Network, enhances early Alzheimer's diagnosis by modeling temporal brain changes using limited neuroimaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of early and accurate diagnosis methods for Alzheimer's due to the irregular progression of brain changes in the prodromal stages necessitates novel solutions.

Method: This paper proposes DiGAN, which combines latent diffusion modeling for generating neuroimaging trajectories with an attention-guided convolutional network to extract structural-temporal features.

Result: DiGAN significantly outperformed state-of-the-art models in experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world ADNI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DiGAN model enhances the robustness and accuracy of early Alzheimer's disease detection, addressing challenges in current approaches.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to the subtle and temporally irregular progression of structural brain changes in the prodromal stages. Existing deep learning approaches require large longitudinal datasets and often fail to model the temporal continuity and modality irregularities inherent in real-world clinical data. To address these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN), which integrates latent diffusion modelling with an attention-guided convolutional network. The diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, enriching temporal context and improving robustness to unevenly spaced visits. The attention-convolutional layer then captures discriminative structural--temporal patterns that distinguish cognitively normal subjects from those with mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets demonstrate that DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing its potential for early-stage AD detection.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a HW/SW co-design approach for CNN FPGA accelerators using HLS tools to improve performance across constraints like latency, power, area, and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN FPGA accelerators often prioritize performance metrics like GOPS, neglecting real-life constraints such as power, cost, and latency.

Method: A parameterized HW/SW co-design methodology using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools is proposed to optimize performance while addressing diverse constraints.

Result: Experimental results show that the methodology outperforms non-parameterized designs, demonstrating higher flexibility and optimization potential.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for optimizing CNN accelerators and can be extended to other deep learning applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are typically designed with a primary focus on maximizing performance, often measured in giga-operations per second (GOPS). However, real-life embedded deep learning (DL) applications impose multiple constraints related to latency, power consumption, area, and cost. This work presents a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design methodology in which a CNN accelerator is described using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that ease the parameterization of the design, facilitating more effective optimizations across multiple design constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.

TL;DR: PriorProbe introduces a method to personalize deep neural networks by extracting individual-specific cognitive priors using a MCMC-based approach, resulting in improved neural network performance in recognizing ambiguous stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately eliciting individual-level cognitive priors for personalizing neural networks while avoiding systematic biases and identification issues.

Method: Developed PriorProbe using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People approach to recover fine-grained, individual-specific priors and tested it in a facial expression recognition task by integrating these priors with a state-of-the-art neural network.

Result: The PriorProbe-derived priors significantly enhanced the neural network's ability to predict individual classification on ambiguous stimuli, outperforming the network alone and other prior sources, while retaining accurate inference on ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: PriorProbe is a robust and interpretable framework that successfully personalizes deep neural networks and improves their performance through individual-specific cognitive priors.

Abstract: Incorporating individual-level cognitive priors offers an important route to personalizing neural networks, yet accurately eliciting such priors remains challenging: existing methods either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases. Here, we introduce PriorProbe, a novel elicitation approach grounded in Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People that recovers fine-grained, individual-specific priors. Focusing on a facial expression recognition task, we apply PriorProbe to individual participants and test whether integrating the recovered priors with a state-of-the-art neural network improves its ability to predict an individual's classification on ambiguous stimuli. The PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains, outperforming both the neural network alone and alternative sources of priors, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels. Together, these results demonstrate that PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks.

### [106] [Explainable Computer Vision Framework for Automated Pore Detection and Criticality Assessment in Additive Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03883)
*Akshansh Mishra,Rakesh Morisetty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an explainable computer vision framework to detect and assess the criticality of pores in 3D tomographic data of additively manufactured components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of internal porosity in additively manufactured parts, which undermines their structural reliability and limits industrial application. Current defect detection methods lack interpretability, complicating understanding of criticality predictions.

Method: Sequential grayscale tomographic slices were reconstructed into 3D datasets, and pores were identified using intensity-based thresholding and connected component analysis. Extracted geometric descriptors characterized each pore, and a pore interaction network was formed. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores, with SHAP analysis used to interpret feature contributions.

Result: Normalized surface distance was found to dominate the prediction of pore criticality, with minimal influence from pore size and negligible impact from other geometric parameters. A strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and failure risk is revealed.

Conclusion: The framework offers an interpretable approach to defect detection and criticality assessment, highlighting the impact of surface distance on failure by enabling insights for quality control and process enhancement in additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Internal porosity remains a critical defect mode in additively manufactured components, compromising structural performance and limiting industrial adoption. Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms. This interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 4DPC$^2$hat, a multimodal large language model tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding, addressing the gap in spatio-temporal modeling and dataset limitations by creating 4DPC$^2$hat-200K and novel learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of tools and datasets for understanding dynamic point cloud sequences in multimodal large language models and improve modeling of motions in spatio-temporal contexts.

Method: The authors construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset (4DPC$^2$hat-200K) with over 700K frames and tailored QA pairs, integrate Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning for long-range dependence modeling, and employ failure-aware bootstrapping learning for iterative reasoning improvement.

Result: Experiments confirm enhanced action comprehension and temporal reasoning, showcasing significant advancements over existing models in dynamic point cloud processing.

Conclusion: The work introduces tools, methods, and datasets critical for advancing dynamic point cloud understanding, laying a robust foundation for this research area.

Abstract: Point clouds provide a compact and expressive representation of 3D objects, and have recently been integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DPC$^2$hat significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared with existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new task, Mask Quality Assessment in the Language-referred Audio-Visual Segmentation (MQA-RefAVS), aimed at evaluating segmentation mask quality without ground-truth references, using multimodal large language model-based tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the lack of methods to assess segmentation mask quality in the Ref-AVS domain without relying on ground-truth annotations, as well as the need for actionable diagnoses.

Method: The authors develop MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark with diverse mask error modes, and propose MQ-Auditor, an MLLM-based tool that uses multimodal inputs to assess mask quality both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Result: MQ-Auditor outperforms existing open-source and commercial models in evaluating mask quality, identifying error types, and recommending corrections while enhancing the performance of Ref-AVS systems.

Conclusion: The paper introduces an innovative task with robust benchmarks and a strong assessment model that address segmentation quality control challenges, paving the way for improvements in language-referred audio-visual segmentation.

Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement. Data and codes will be released at https://github.com/jasongief/MQA-RefAVS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the long reconstruction times associated with iterative reconstruction algorithms in large-scale 3D photoacoustic imaging, which limit practical and clinical applications.

Method: The proposed method, GPAIR, leverages Gaussian-kernel-based spatial grids and GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators to achieve orders-of-magnitude faster computation compared to traditional methods.

Result: GPAIR achieved ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speeds for 3D targets with 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The GPAIR method revolutionizes image reconstruction in 3D photoacoustic imaging by enabling near-real-time large-scale reconstructions, paving the way for advanced clinical applications.

Abstract: Although the iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm can substantially correct reconstruction artifacts in photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT), it suffers from long reconstruction times, especially for large-scale three-dimensional (3D) imaging in which IR takes hundreds of seconds to hours. The computing burden severely limits the practical applicability of IR algorithms. In this work, we proposed an ultrafast IR method for 3D PACT, called Gaussian-kernel-based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction (GPAIR), which achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration in computing. GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels. By deriving analytical closed-form expression for pressure waves and implementing powerful GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators, GPAIR demonstrates extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments. This revolutionary ultrafast image reconstruction enables near-real-time large-scale 3D PA reconstruction, significantly advancing 3D PACT toward clinical applications.

TL;DR: This study explores the use of Vision Transformer foundation models combined with various methods for clustering unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters, achieving high accuracy and providing recommendations for ecologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling of animal images is time-intensive and limits the ability to monitor biodiversity at scale, necessitating automated solutions for improved efficiency.

Method: The study utilizes five Vision Transformer models, five dimensionality reduction techniques, and four clustering algorithms to benchmark their performance across 60 animal species, performing tests on random subsets of validated images for species-level and intra-specific clustering.

Result: The best-performing setup achieved a V-measure of 0.958 using DINOv3 embeddings, t-SNE, and supervised hierarchical clustering, with unsupervised methods also performing well (V-measure: 0.943). Additionally, the approach demonstrated robustness to species distribution imbalances and extracted patterns like sexual dimorphism and age classes.

Conclusion: ViT models combined with appropriate clustering methods effectively classify species from unlabeled images and reveal ecologically significant patterns. An open-source benchmarking toolkit is also introduced for ecologists to optimize their workflows.

Abstract: Manual labeling of animal images remains a significant bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring efforts. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.

TL;DR: NH-Fair introduces a unified benchmark to evaluate fairness in machine learning for vision and vision-language models, focusing on reducing bias and improving comparisons under standardized protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in assessing fairness due to inconsistent datasets, metrics, and evaluation methods across vision and multi-modal models, aiming to enhance fair comparisons and reduce biases in machine learning.

Method: NH-Fair establishes a benchmark with standardized protocols, fair training, systematic tuning studies, and analysis of debiasing methods across supervised and zero-shot models.

Result: The study uncovers that well-tuned ERM baselines often outperform debiasing methods, data-augmentation effectively achieves fairness and utility gains, and LVLMs have subgroup disparities despite overall high accuracy.

Conclusion: NH-Fair offers a reproducible framework emphasizing tuning-aware, harm-conscious fairness evaluation, highlighting practical strategies for reducing biases in vision and vision-language models.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data often inherit and amplify biases against certain social groups, raising urgent concerns about their deployment at scale. While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an advanced framework for zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition by addressing flaws in existing methods and integrating hierarchical structure and discriminative element awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve zero-shot handwritten Chinese character recognition by addressing the limitations of treating characters as flat radical sequences.

Method: The approach involves three innovations: Information Entropy Prior for discriminative focus, Dual-View Radical Tree for multi-granularity feature extraction, and Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion for decoding enhancement.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot recognition and demonstrates exceptional adaptability and data efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework significantly surpasses existing baselines and offers promising generalization and efficiency for recognizing handwritten Chinese characters.

Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Phaedra, a new tokenizer improving the representation of scientific images, which is tested to handle tasks of various complexities with strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers, designed for visual perception in images, lack optimal performance for scientific images that require retaining physical and spectral properties. New approaches are needed to better capture these aspects for scientific purposes.

Method: The authors developed Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. They tested it on a suite of image tokenizers evaluating PDE fidelity in physical and spectral spaces.

Result: Phaedra consistently enhances image reconstruction across diverse PDE datasets and demonstrates strong generalization to varying tasks such as known/unknown PDEs and real-world scientific data.

Conclusion: Phaedra outperforms prior tokenizers by better capturing details and magnitudes in scientific images, offering improvements for scientific image analysis and generalization to complex tasks.

Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of real-world spatial reasoning for VLMs, where prior benchmarks lacked realism and varied task designs, hindering advancement.

Method: Developed SpatiaLab with 30 tasks spread across six categories, providing both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluations, and tested various state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: Results revealed VLMs underperform compared to humans, with the best performing model (InternVL3.5-72B) achieving only 54.93% accuracy in multiple-choice versus 87.57% for humans.

Conclusion: SpatiaLab exposes significant limitations in VLMs’ spatial reasoning and provides a real-world benchmark to drive advancements in human-aligned spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method for pruning masked self-supervised vision transformers using block-level information entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of deploying large masked self-supervised vision transformers in resource-constrained scenarios by investigating block importance for downstream tasks.

Method: The method, called Gardener, uses information entropy of pretrained block weights to identify redundant transformer blocks for pruning without any data.

Result: Gardener demonstrates effectiveness, outperforming existing pruning baselines, and retaining competitive transfer performance even after removing up to 91.7% of blocks.

Conclusion: Mask self-supervised vision transformers contain significant redundancy at the block level, and Gardener provides an efficient, principled approach for compression and transfer learning.

Abstract: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have become a dominant pretraining paradigm, yet their substantial model size poses significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.

*Leeje Jang,Yijun Lin,Yao-Yi Chiang,Jerod Weinman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TiCLS combines visual and linguistic features using a character-level pretrained language model to improve scene text spotting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text spotting methods lack effective integration of external linguistic knowledge, limiting their ability to recognize ambiguous or fragmented text.

Method: TiCLS uses a pretrained character-level language model and introduces a linguistic decoder to fuse visual and linguistic features for text recognition.

Result: TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text datasets, demonstrating the benefits of linguistic integration.

Conclusion: Integrating external linguistic knowledge via pretrained language models improves the robustness and accuracy of scene text spotting systems.

Abstract: Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize text in real-world images, where instances are often short, fragmented, or visually ambiguous. Existing methods primarily rely on visual cues and implicitly capture local character dependencies, but they overlook the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Prior attempts to integrate language models either adapt language modeling objectives without external knowledge or apply pretrained models that are misaligned with the word-level granularity of scene text. We propose TiCLS, an end-to-end text spotter that explicitly incorporates external linguistic knowledge from a character-level pretrained language model. TiCLS introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, yet can be initialized by a pretrained language model, enabling robust recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text. Experiments on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text demonstrate that TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of PLM-guided linguistic integration for scene text spotting.

*Joanna Kaleta,Bartosz Świrta,Kacper Kania,Przemysław Spurek,Marek Kowalski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyStyle introduces a pose-free, zero-shot stylization framework for 3D reconstruction, combining multimodal conditioning with high-quality geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of integrating stylization and appearance control into pose-free 3D reconstruction pipelines, which remains underexplored.

Method: The modular framework supports textual and visual inputs and leverages feed-forward architecture for stylization integrated into 3D Gaussian Splatting methods.

Result: Experiments show improved style controllability and high geometric fidelity. A user study highlights superior stylization quality over prior methods.

Conclusion: AnyStyle advances feed-forward 3D asset creation by combining multimodal flexibility with stylization while maintaining reconstruction quality and ease of integration into existing backbones.

Abstract: The growing demand for rapid and scalable 3D asset creation has driven interest in feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerging as an effective scene representation. While recent approaches have demonstrated pose-free reconstruction from unposed image collections, integrating stylization or appearance control into such pipelines remains underexplored. Existing attempts largely rely on image-based conditioning, which limits both controllability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce AnyStyle, a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot stylization through multimodal conditioning. Our method supports both textual and visual style inputs, allowing users to control the scene appearance using natural language descriptions or reference images. We propose a modular stylization architecture that requires only minimal architectural modifications and can be integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones. Experiments demonstrate that AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior feed-forward stylization methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study further confirms that AnyStyle achieves superior stylization quality compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach. Repository: https://github.com/joaxkal/AnyStyle.

### [119] [Fast, Unsupervised Framework for Registration Quality Assessment of Multi-stain Histological Whole Slide Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04046)
*Shikha Dubey,Patricia Raciti,Kristopher Standish,Albert Juan Ramon,Erik Ames Burlingame*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised framework for evaluating the registration quality of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing histopathological WSIs are inefficient, computationally expensive, and lack reliability, which hinders large-scale analysis. A fast and automated solution is required.

Method: A framework is introduced that employs down-sampled tissue masks and deformation-based metrics for comparing H&E and IHC WSIs. These metrics assess global structural alignment and local transformation smoothness without ground-truth annotations.

Result: The proposed metrics correlate strongly with human expert evaluations across multiple IHC markers and are computationally efficient.

Conclusion: This framework provides a reliable, unsupervised solution for real-time WSI registration quality assessment, suitable for large-scale usage in digital pathology.

Abstract: High-fidelity registration of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs), such as hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), is vital for integrated molecular analysis but challenging to evaluate without ground-truth (GT) annotations. Existing WSI-level assessments -- using annotated landmarks or intensity-based similarity metrics -- are often time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability. This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations. In the absence of GT, this framework offers reliable, real-time RQA with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology.

*Juntao Zhang,Angona Biswas,Jaydeep Rade,Charchit Shukla,Juan Ren,Anwesha Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Aditya Balu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automated system to detect and restore artifacts in AFM images using machine learning and adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in AFM images, caused by noise, scanning flaws, or tip-sample interactions, degrade image quality and hinder accurate surface analysis.

Method: A pipeline with a classification model for detecting artifacts, followed by a semantic segmentation network for artifact masking, directional neighbor-based inpainting, and Gaussian smoothing for artifact restoration. A user-friendly GUI supports real-time adjustments.

Result: The proposed method successfully removes artifacts while preserving nanoscale structural details, ensuring higher fidelity in AFM image interpretation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust and geometry-aware solution for automated and high-quality AFM image analysis, improving usability and accuracy in research and applications.

Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution surface imaging at the nanoscale, yet the output is often degraded by artifacts introduced by environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions. To address this challenge, a lightweight and fully automated framework for artifact detection and restoration in AFM image analysis is presented. The pipeline begins with a classification model that determines whether an AFM image contains artifacts. If necessary, a lightweight semantic segmentation network, custom-designed and trained on AFM data, is applied to generate precise artifact masks. These masks are adaptively expanded based on their structural orientation and then inpainted using a directional neighbor-based interpolation strategy to preserve 3D surface continuity. A localized Gaussian smoothing operation is then applied for seamless restoration. The system is integrated into a user-friendly GUI that supports real-time parameter adjustments and batch processing. Experimental results demonstrate the effective artifact removal while preserving nanoscale structural details, providing a robust, geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data interpretation.

*Rio Aguina-Kang,Kevin James Blackburn-Matzen,Thibault Groueix,Vladimir Kim,Matheus Gadelha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeingThroughClutter is a method that reconstructs structured 3D representations from single images in cluttered and occluded scenes by segmenting and modeling each object sequentially, avoiding task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome underperformance of existing methods in cluttered and occluded scenes by avoiding reliance on intermediate tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation.

Method: The method introduces an iterative pipeline for object detection, segmentation, removal, and 3D modeling, orchestrated by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Each object's segmentation improves iteratively by isolating and removing previously detected objects.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets, showing its effectiveness in highly occluded and cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: The work highlights a robust pipeline for 3D reconstruction, benefiting from advancements in foundation models and requiring no task-specific training.

Abstract: We present SeeingThroughClutter, a method for reconstructing structured 3D representations from single images by segmenting and modeling objects individually. Prior approaches rely on intermediate tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often underperform in complex scenes, particularly in the presence of occlusion and clutter. We address this by introducing an iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes. Our method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from ongoing advances in foundation models. We demonstrate stateof-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HPA10M, a massive IHC image dataset, and iSight, an AI-based framework that enhances IHC diagnostic accuracy by analyzing staining features across tissues. iSight outperforms other models and improves pathologists' assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of AI applicability in immunohistochemistry (IHC) due to domain-specific variations and improve diagnostic accuracy for pathology.

Method: The authors developed the HPA10M dataset of 10,495,672 IHC images and trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework using token-level attention mechanisms, analyzing IHC staining features from images alongside metadata.

Result: The iSight model achieved high accuracy for staining assessment, outperforming existing models by 2.5–10.2% and improving pathologists’ evaluation and inter-rater agreement in user studies.

Conclusion: iSight shows potential as an AI tool to enhance reliability and consistency in IHC diagnostics, supporting adoption in clinical workflows for better patient care.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides information on protein expression in tissue sections and is commonly used to support pathology diagnosis and disease triage. While AI models for H\&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\% accuracy for location, 76.6\% for intensity, and 75.7\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\% vs 68\% for location, 70\% vs 57\% for intensity, 68\% vs 52\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $κ$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation. This work establishes a foundation for AI systems that can improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and highlights the potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance the consistency and reliability of IHC assessment.

*Junbo Zou,Ziheng Huang,Shengjie Zhang,Liwen Zhang,Weining Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoBrain addresses the challenge of long-form video understanding by enabling adaptive frame sampling with dual agents, improving performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge arises from the need to effectively understand long videos using Vision-Language Models without losing vital information or exhausting computational resources.

Method: VideoBrain introduces dual learned agents (CLIP-based and Uniform) for adaptive frame sampling and employs a behavior-aware reward function to efficiently guide model actions.

Result: VideoBrain improves performance by +3.5% to +9.0% compared to baselines while processing 30-40% fewer frames, demonstrating cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: VideoBrain strikes a balance between computational efficiency and effective information capture, advancing long-form video understanding in VLMs.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to the inherent tension between computational constraints and the need to capture information distributed across thousands of frames. Existing approaches either sample frames uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in a single pass (with no recovery from poor choices). We propose VideoBrain, an end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to adaptively acquire visual information through learned sampling policies. Our approach features dual complementary agents: a CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across the video and a Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. Unlike prior agent-based methods that rely on text-only LLMs orchestrating visual tools, our VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. To prevent models from invoking agents indiscriminately to maximize rewards, we introduce a behavior-aware reward function coupled with a data classification pipeline that teaches the model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial. Experiments on four long video benchmarks demonstrate that VideoBrain achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over the baseline while using 30-40% fewer frames, with strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch model for hyperspectral anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) often faces challenges with noisy, unlabelled data and limitations of existing deep learning methods in capturing long-range dependencies or computational cost.

Method: The proposed DMS2F-HAD model uses Mamba-based architecture to process spatial and spectral features in dual branches and dynamically integrates them through gated fusion to boost anomaly detection.

Result: DMS2F-HAD achieves an exceptional average AUC of 98.78% across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, and outperforms similar approaches with inference speeds 4.6 times faster.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates scalability and superior generalization, making it highly suitable for practical hyperspectral anomaly detection applications and overcoming prior limitations.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify rare and irregular targets in high-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are often noisy and unlabelled data. Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods. The results highlight DMS2FHAD's strong generalization and scalability, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical HAD applications.

Motivation: To enhance the quality of feature extraction in endoscopy videos for improved 3D reconstruction using SfM.

Method: Proposed a new local feature extraction method, SuperPoint-E, with Tracking Adaptation supervision, ensuring better feature detection and description.

Result: SuperPoint-E delivers denser 3D reconstructions that span longer video segments with higher detection precision and more discriminative descriptors, surpassing SuperPoint and COLMAP in SfM tasks.

Conclusion: SuperPoint-E significantly enhances SfM performance in endoscopy, improving detection density, feature survival, and descriptor discriminability for better overall results.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on boosting the feature extraction to improve the performance of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) in endoscopy videos. We present SuperPoint-E, a new local feature extraction method that, using our proposed Tracking Adaptation supervision strategy, significantly improves the quality of feature detection and description in endoscopy. Extensive experimentation on real endoscopy recordings studies our approach's most suitable configuration and evaluates SuperPoint-E feature quality. The comparison with other baselines also shows that our 3D reconstructions are denser and cover more and longer video segments because our detector fires more densely and our features are more likely to survive (i.e. higher detection precision). In addition, our descriptor is more discriminative, making the guided matching step almost redundant. The presented approach brings significant improvements in the 3D reconstructions obtained, via SfM on endoscopy videos, compared to the original SuperPoint and the gold standard SfM COLMAP pipeline.

Motivation: The authors address the challenge of limited datasets available for training VLMs to precisely understand complex flowcharts, which are crucial for gaining insights beyond text-based explanations.

Method: They generate a synthesized visual QA dataset, named JSynFlow, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to create flowchart images from domain-specific language code and formulate task-specific QA pairs.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs with JSynFlow substantially enhances their performance in flowchart-based question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that JSynFlow is an effective solution for enhancing flowchart understanding in VLMs, and the dataset has been made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Vision and language models (VLMs) are expected to analyse complex documents, such as those containing flowcharts, through a question-answering (QA) interface. The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs). Our dataset comprises task descriptions for various business occupations, the corresponding flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language (DSL) code, and related QA pairs. This paper details the dataset's synthesis procedure and demonstrates that fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges in selecting optimal segmentation architectures for specific imaging setups and determining model reliability on new samples.

Method: Developed a cross-modal evaluation framework to assess six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets, focusing on systematic performance variations and practical feedback.

Result: The study demonstrated that performance of segmentation architectures varies with imaging modality; UNet performs well for high-contrast 2D imaging, while DeepLabv3+ is better for more complex cases.

Conclusion: The framework aids materials characterization by providing guidance on architecture selection, reliability assessment, and feature interpretability for diverse imaging modalities.

Abstract: Segmentation architectures are typically benchmarked on single imaging modalities, obscuring deployment-relevant performance variations: an architecture optimal for one modality may underperform on another. We present a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Our evaluation of six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets reveals that optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a strategy to enhance inter-slice consistency in 3D medical imaging reconstructions using 2D diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3D medical imaging is crucial for clinical and research applications, challenges in data collection and computational demands hinder effective 3D data distribution learning through diffusion models, leading to discontinuities in reconstructed 3D volumes.

Method: The authors propose ISCS, which regulates the consistency of stochastic noise during diffusion sampling to align trajectories without additional loss terms or computational cost.

Result: The ISCS strategy significantly improves the performance of 3D medical imaging reconstruction pipelines based on 2D diffusion models across various medical imaging datasets.

Conclusion: Controlling inter-slice stochasticity is an effective approach for achieving consistent, high-quality 3D medical imaging using 2D diffusion priors.

Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

TL;DR: Point2Insert is introduced as a sparse-point-based framework for user-friendly and accurate object insertion in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of labor-intensive mask annotations in mask-based methods and imprecise placements in instruction-based methods.

Method: Introduces sparse positive and negative points for object placement, with a two-stage training process and mask-guided teacher model for distillation.

Result: Point2Insert achieves better performance than baselines and larger models.

Conclusion: Point2Insert simplifies precise object insertion in videos, enhancing control and reducing annotation effort.

Abstract: This paper introduces Point2Insert, a sparse-point-based framework for flexible and user-friendly object insertion in videos, motivated by the growing popularity of accurate, low-effort object placement. Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with $\times$10 more parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISMamba, a novel method for improving vision-focused State Space Models (SSMs) by addressing the impact of scan order and enhancing rotation robustness, delivering high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues related to predefined scan orders in vision SSMs, which critically impact performance due to object continuity disruption and poor robustness to geometric transformations like rotation.

Method: The authors propose PRISMamba, which partitions images into concentric rings for aggregation, incorporates short radial SSMs for context propagation, and uses partial channel filtering to improve efficiency and reduce computational cost.

Result: PRISMamba achieves 84.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 3.9G FLOPs, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy compared to VMamba, while showing robustness to rotation through minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: PRISMamba effectively addresses the challenges of scan order and rotation robustness in vision SSMs, representing a critical advancement in the accuracy, efficiency, and general applicability of such models.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to attention for vision tasks, offering lineartime sequence processing with competitive accuracy. Vision SSMs, however, require serializing 2D images into 1D token sequences along a predefined scan order, a factor often overlooked. We show that scan order critically affects performance by altering spatial adjacency, fracturing object continuity, and amplifying degradation under geometric transformations such as rotation. We present Partial RIng Scan Mamba (PRISMamba), a rotation-robust traversal that partitions an image into concentric rings, performs order-agnostic aggregation within each ring, and propagates context across rings through a set of short radial SSMs. Efficiency is further improved via partial channel filtering, which routes only the most informative channels through the recurrent ring pathway while keeping the rest on a lightweight residual branch. On ImageNet-1K, PRISMamba achieves 84.5% Top-1 with 3.9G FLOPs and 3,054 img/s on A100, outperforming VMamba in both accuracy and throughput while requiring fewer FLOPs. It also maintains performance under rotation, whereas fixed-path scans drop by 1~2%. These results highlight scan-order design, together with channel filtering, as a crucial, underexplored factor for accuracy, efficiency, and rotation robustness in Vision SSMs. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Method: The method involves creating Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR) for efficient 3D data encoding in 2D and a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module to capture global motion patterns using spectral cues through FFT.

Result: HoloEv-Net achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, improving performance by up to 10.29% while introducing a lightweight variant that is significantly more efficient in parameters, FLOPs, and latency.

Conclusion: HoloEv-Net provides a scalable and efficient solution to EAR, offering competitive accuracy and substantial computational advantages, suitable for edge deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) has attracted significant attention due to the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras. However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment.

*Angel Martinez-Sanchez,Parthib Roy,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces doScenes, a real-world dataset connecting free-form passenger instructions to driving trajectories, and adapts OpenEMMA to evaluate instruction-conditioned driving using ADE as a metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between real-world driving and simulated or restricted command systems by enabling vehicles to respond to diverse passenger instructions for safer and adaptive driving.

Method: The authors integrate doScenes directives into OpenEMMA, an open-source framework, allowing linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation and using ADE to assess performance.

Result: Instruction conditioning significantly improves robustness, reducing mean ADE by 98.7% and aligning trajectories better with well-phrased prompts yielding a 5.1% ADE improvement.

Conclusion: Instruction-aware planning enhances driving decisions and trajectory alignment. The framework with prompts and scripts released establishes a reproducible baseline to advance real-world instruction-conditioned planning.

Abstract: Instruction-grounded driving, where passenger language guides trajectory planning, requires vehicles to understand intent before motion. However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning. GitHub: https://github.com/Mi3-Lab/doScenes-VLM-Planning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiMo introduces a unified discrete diffusion framework for bidirectional text-motion understanding and generation, overcoming limitations of autoregressive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve bidirectional text-motion understanding and generation using a unified model, addressing quality-latency trade-offs and enhancing token fidelity.

Method: It employs masked token refinement using discrete diffusion while integrating RVQ for token fidelity and GRPO for alignment and controllability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate strong motion quality, competitive understanding in both directions, and capabilities like motion completion and caption correction.

Conclusion: DiMo advances text-motion generation, creates a unified model, and showcases flexibility in tasks beyond traditional design.

Abstract: Prior masked modeling motion generation methods predominantly study text-to-motion. We present DiMo, a discrete diffusion-style framework, which extends masked modeling to bidirectional text--motion understanding and generation. Unlike GPT-style autoregressive approaches that tokenize motion and decode sequentially, DiMo performs iterative masked token refinement, unifying Text-to-Motion (T2M), Motion-to-Text (M2T), and text-free Motion-to-Motion (M2M) within a single model. This decoding paradigm naturally enables a quality-latency trade-off at inference via the number of refinement steps.We further improve motion token fidelity with residual vector quantization (RVQ) and enhance alignment and controllability with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding under a unified framework. In addition, we demonstrate model ability in text-free motion completion, text-guided motion prediction and motion caption correction without architectural change.Additional qualitative results are available on our project page: https://animotionlab.github.io/DiMo/.

### [134] [Continuous Degradation Modeling via Latent Flow Matching for Real-World Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04193)
*Hyeonjae Kim,Dongjin Kim,Eugene Jin,Tae Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework that simulates real-world degradations on low-resolution (LR) images to enhance super-resolution (SR) training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between synthetic and real-world super-resolution by creating authentic LR images that replicate real-world degradations.

Method: The framework uses latent degradation space and flow matching to generate LR images from a single HR image, simulating realistic artifacts and degradations.

Result: The synthetic LR images closely replicate real-world artifacts, enabling better SR model training, and arbitrary-scale SR models show consistently improved results using these datasets.

Conclusion: This approach substantially closes the performance gap between synthetic and real-world super-resolution by improving training datasets with realistic degradations.

Abstract: While deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have shown impressive outcomes with synthetic degradation scenarios such as bicubic downsampling, they frequently struggle to perform well on real-world images that feature complex, nonlinear degradations like noise, blur, and compression artifacts. Recent efforts to address this issue have involved the painstaking compilation of real low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, usually limited to several specific downscaling factors. To address these challenges, our work introduces a novel framework capable of synthesizing authentic LR images from a single HR image by leveraging the latent degradation space with flow matching. Our approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, which facilitates the creation of large-scale, real-world SR training datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that our synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Furthermore, both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using our datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.

*Feng Wang,Yichun Shi,Ceyuan Yang,Qiushan Guo,Jingxiang Sun,Alan Yuille,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTok introduces a framework for efficient and effective video tokenization by leveraging spatial features of a single key frame and encoding subsequent frames as residual tokens. This reduces the token quantity while maintaining representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in video tokenization approaches that rely on naive frame-sampling strategies and achieve compact, expressive video representations for understanding and generation tasks.

Method: VTok decouples spatial and temporal representations by preserving the spatial data of a key frame and encoding additional frames into residual tokens, reducing overall token complexity. This ensures viewpoint and motion changes are effectively captured.

Result: VTok outperforms baseline tokenization methods, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency in both video understanding (e.g., 3.4% increase on TV-Align accuracy) and text-to-video generation while requiring fewer tokens per video.

Conclusion: VTok sets a new standard for video tokenization, offering both improved performance and shorter token sequences, making it a viable paradigm for future video-related research.

Abstract: This work presents VTok, a unified video tokenization framework that can be used for both generation and understanding tasks. Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.

*Chao Li,Rui Zhang,Siyuan Huang,Xian Zhong,Hongbo Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights a novel method, AGMA, for improving human trajectory forecasting by addressing prior misalignment using adaptive Gaussian mixture models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in human trajectory forecasting often fail to account for the multimodal nature of human behavior due to poorly aligned priors, limiting performance and prediction diversity.

Method: The proposed AGMA framework constructs expressive priors in two steps: first, it extracts diverse behavioral patterns from training data, then distills them into a scene-adaptive global prior that guides inference.

Result: AGMA outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets, showcasing the importance of quality prior modeling.

Conclusion: High-quality priors are essential for accurate and diverse human trajectory forecasting. AGMA effectively addresses this with its adaptive prior construction approach, enhancing predictive accuracy and diversity.

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting requires capturing the multimodal nature of pedestrian behavior. However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. We theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck. Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.

### [137] [Adaptive 1D Video Diffusion Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04220)
*Yao Teng,Minxuan Lin,Xian Liu,Shuai Wang,Xiao Yang,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a novel transformer-based video generation model addressing limitations in existing autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video autoencoders face issues such as fixed-rate compression, inflexible CNN architectures, and limited detail recovery capabilities in decoders, hindering efficient and dynamic video modeling.

Method: The proposed One-DVA uses a query-based vision transformer for adaptive 1D encoding and spatiotemporal feature extraction, with a dropout mechanism for variable latent lengths, and a diffusion transformer for pixel-space reconstruction guided by latent inputs.

Result: One-DVA achieves comparable reconstruction quality to 3D-CNN VAEs at the same compression ratio while supporting adaptive compression for higher ratios and improved generative modeling with fine-tuned decoding.

Conclusion: The One-DVA framework efficiently handles the limitations of traditional autoencoders, enabling adaptive compression and enhanced video generation quality, with strong potential for generative applications.

Abstract: Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate MRI brain image segmentation faces challenges like tissue ambiguity due to partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The authors propose IF-UNet, which integrates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into a UNet framework, allowing the model to manage membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees.

Result: IF-UNet outperforms existing approaches in segmentation tasks evaluated on the IBSR dataset, showing higher accuracy, Dice coefficient, and IoU.

Conclusion: Incorporating intuitionistic fuzzy logic enhances UNet’s ability to handle uncertainties, improving MRI brain image segmentation performance.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of MRI brain images is essential for image analysis, diagnosis of neuro-logical disorders and medical image computing. In the deep learning approach, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially UNet, are widely applied in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to deal with uncertainty due to the partial volume effect in brain images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework, named UNet with intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IF-UNet), which incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet. The model processes input data in terms of membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees, allowing it to better address tissue ambiguity resulting from partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset, and its performance is computed using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and intersection over union (IoU). Experimental results confirm that IF-UNet improves segmentation quality with handling uncertainty in brain images.

*Suzeyu Chen,Leheng Li,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPOT-Occ, a novel Transformer-based 3D occupancy prediction method prioritizing efficient sparse feature decoding for autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, real-time 3D occupancy prediction is necessary for safe autonomous vehicle operation, but decoding sparse voxel features efficiently remains a challenge.

Method: The paper proposes a Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder with guided feature selection and focused aggregation, utilizing prototypes and a denoising paradigm for stable feature association.

Result: SPOT-Occ achieves improved accuracy and speed compared to previous methods, offering significant practical advantages.

Conclusion: Prototype-guided attention and stable feature aggregation enhance sparse 3D decoding efficiency, validating SPOT-Occ's superiority for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.
  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.

*Aditya R. Bhattacharya,Debanjan Goswami,Shayok Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ACIL, an active learning method for continual learning, reducing annotation costs while combating catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning faces challenges like catastrophic forgetting and high annotation costs due to the inaccessible data from previous episodes.

Method: The proposed ACIL framework selects exemplar samples using uncertainty and diversity criteria for annotation, integrating them into future episodes.

Result: Empirical analyses on multiple vision datasets demonstrate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ACIL compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ACIL offers a practical solution to address catastrophic forgetting and reduce annotation efforts in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.

TL;DR: This paper presents a depth-guided framework for improving the accuracy and stability of human mesh recovery from monocular videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with depth ambiguities, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities in human mesh recovery from monocular videos.

Method: The framework integrates three components: depth-guided multi-scale fusion, metric-aware pose and shape estimation, and motion-depth aligned refinement using cross-modal attention.

Result: The method achieved superior performance on challenging benchmarks, improving robustness to heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively resolves metric consistency and temporal stability issues, significantly advancing robust human mesh recovery from monocular videos.

Abstract: Monocular video human mesh recovery faces fundamental challenges in maintaining metric consistency and temporal stability due to inherent depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties. While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD) for emotion recognition using language, visual, and acoustic modalities, addressing multimodal heterogeneity issues and improving feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human multimodal emotion recognition faces challenges due to modality heterogeneities and inconsistent contributions of each modality.

Method: DHMD employs a self-regression mechanism to decouple features into modality-irrelevant and modality-exclusive components and uses a two-stage knowledge distillation: coarse-grained distillation via dynamic graphs and fine-grained distillation for cross-modal alignment.

Result: DHMD surpasses state-of-the-art methods on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI datasets, with up to 2.4% improvement in accuracy and 1.9% in F1 score.

Conclusion: The hierarchical distillation strategy effectively aligns multimodal features, offering superior performance and meaningful data visualization in tackling multimodal emotion recognition challenges.

Abstract: Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to infer human emotions by integrating information from language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\%/2.4\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\%/1.9\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\%/1.8\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively. Meanwhile, visualization results reveal that both the graph edges and dictionary activations in DHMD exhibit meaningful distribution patterns across modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.

*Siyu Jiang,Feiyang Chen,Xiaojin Zhang,Kun He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes KVSmooth, a method to reduce hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve model reliability through adaptive smoothing during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the hallucination problem in MLLMs, where their outputs deviate from the visual inputs due to semantic drift, undermining their reliance and accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces KVSmooth, a training-free mechanism that performs adaptive smoothing on hidden states using exponential moving average (EMA) in the KV-Cache. The method dynamically adjusts its strength based on attention entropy to mitigate hallucination efficiently during inference.

Result: KVSmooth achieves significant reduction in hallucination, reducing $\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from 41.8 to 18.2. It also improves overall performance, raising the $F_1$ score from 77.5 to 79.2, while maintaining higher precision and recall simultaneously.

Conclusion: KVSmooth is a computationally efficient and generalizable solution compared to other methods, validating its ability to robustly mitigate hallucinations and enhance MLLM performance.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.
  To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.
  Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SkeletonGaussian, a method for generating editable dynamic 3D objects, focusing on refining motion control and editability compared to previous methods, through a skeleton-driven hierarchical representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of implicit deformation field representations in current 4D generation methods, which hinder direct motion control and editing.

Method: The proposed method, SkeletonGaussian, decomposes motion into rigid (driven by skeleton through linear blend skinning) and non-rigid components, introducing a hexplane refinement for non-rigid deformations, derived from monocular video input.

Result: Experimental results show that SkeletonGaussian achieves superior generation quality and provides intuitive motion editing capabilities, improving upon existing 4D generation methods.

Conclusion: SkeletonGaussian establishes a new standard for editable and interpretable 4D generation, enabling better control over motion through its hierarchical articulated representation.

Abstract: 4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

*Jue Gong,Zihan Zhou,Jingkai Wang,Xiaohong Liu,Yulun Zhang,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses underexposed face issues by introducing a novel Face Fill-Light Enhancement (FFE) method, utilizing a new large paired dataset (LYF-160K) and a physics-aware diffusion model for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve limitations of current face relighting methods, which often disrupt the original scene lighting or create inconsistencies, by introducing an approach specifically tailored for practical face fill-light enhancement needs.

Method: The method introduces a large paired dataset (LYF-160K) created with a renderer that controls 6 independent lighting factors. It uses physics-aware lighting prompts (PALP) and trains a fill-light diffusion model (FiLitDiff) on top of a diffusion backbone for efficient and physically consistent results.

Result: The experiments showed that the proposed method achieves strong perceptual quality and retains better background illumination compared to existing approaches, validated on held-out paired datasets.

Conclusion: The study offers a scalable solution to face fill-light enhancement using a large dataset and an efficient diffusion-based model. The approach demonstrates controllable and accurate results with low computational demands, and it makes resources publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Face fill-light enhancement (FFE) brightens underexposed faces by adding virtual fill light while keeping the original scene illumination and background unchanged. Most face relighting methods aim to reshape overall lighting, which can suppress the input illumination or modify the entire scene, leading to foreground-background inconsistency and mismatching practical FFE needs. To support scalable learning, we introduce LightYourFace-160K (LYF-160K), a large-scale paired dataset built with a physically consistent renderer that injects a disk-shaped area fill light controlled by six disentangled factors, producing 160K before-and-after pairs. We first pretrain a physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) that embeds the 6D parameters into conditioning tokens, using an auxiliary planar-light reconstruction objective. Building on a pretrained diffusion backbone, we then train a fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff), an efficient one-step model conditioned on physically grounded lighting codes, enabling controllable and high-fidelity fill lighting at low computational cost. Experiments on held-out paired sets demonstrate strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics, while better preserving background illumination.

Motivation: The static approach to visual grounding in LVLMs causes loss of visual detail and reliance on language priors, which limits their capability for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric to identify the optimal layer for visual grounding, and a training-free method called LASER, which adaptively enhances attention-guided visual localization and decoding for reasoning tasks.

Result: Experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that LASER achieves significant accuracy improvements, especially for tasks with varying complexity.

Conclusion: Dynamic visual grounding is essential for complex reasoning tasks, and LASER provides an effective, training-free solution to enhance LVLM performance by selecting task-specific layers.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.

*Zihan Lou,Jinlong Fan,Sihan Ma,Yuxiang Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces JOintGS, a framework for creating accurate 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos, addressing challenges like noisy inputs and dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of reconstructing animatable 3D human avatars from RGB videos in natural, uncontrolled scenarios, including inaccurate camera parameters and human pose data.

Method: The framework jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations using a refinement mechanism, background separation, temporal dynamics, and a residual color field.

Result: JOintGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 2.1 dB PSNR improvement on the NeuMan dataset and demonstrating robust performance even with noisy inputs.

Conclusion: JOintGS provides high-fidelity 3D avatar reconstruction with enhanced robustness and real-time rendering, making it effective and practical for challenging, real-world settings.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos remains challenging, particularly in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods (e.g., COLMAP, HMR2.0) are often inaccurate. Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. Notably, our method shows significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to the baseline.Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/JOintGS.

*Jie Chen,Zhu Wang,Chuanbin Liu,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of learning invariant visual representations using diverse pretrained models in a fully unsupervised manner and proposes a novel multiview self-representation learning framework (MSRL) to achieve this. Extensive experiments validate the approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrepancies in pretrained model objectives and architectures cause diversity in feature distributions, posing challenges in learning invariant representations from visual data using multiple pretrained models in an unsupervised manner.

Method: The proposed MSRL method learns invariant representations by leveraging heterogeneous multiview data obtained from pretrained models. Linear models are trained on frozen backbones, and an information-passing mechanism, along with a consistency scheme for assignment probability, guides self-representation learning across views.

Result: MSRL demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods on multiple visual datasets, showcasing its efficacy for unsupervised representation learning.

Conclusion: The MSRL approach effectively aggregates features from various pretrained models to produce invariant representations, marking a significant step in unsupervised visual representation learning.

Abstract: Features of the same sample generated by different pretrained models often exhibit inherently distinct feature distributions because of discrepancies in the model pretraining objectives or architectures. Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scaling foundation models like MUSt3R for real-world large-scale monocular 3D reconstruction from RGB streams, while avoiding limitations of memory and maintaining accurate performance.

Method: The proposed method segments streams into smaller sequences, aligns segments, and integrates lightweight loop closure optimization, without requiring retraining of the MUSt3R model.

Result: The approach achieves comparable 3D reconstruction and trajectory performance to traditional complex methods. It is validated on datasets like TUM and 7-Scenes, and it successfully reconstructs long RGB sequences effectively.

Conclusion: S-MUSt3R demonstrates the potential of extending foundation models for scalable 3D reconstruction, achieving accurate predictions in real-world settings without retraining, and providing significant metric-space advantages.

Abstract: The recent paradigm shift in 3D vision led to the rise of foundation models with remarkable capabilities in 3D perception from uncalibrated images. However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. This work proposes S-MUSt3R, a simple and efficient pipeline that extends the limits of foundation models for monocular 3D reconstruction. Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), a novel unsupervised framework that effectively adapts large-scale vision-language models without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models excel in zero-shot generalization but demand labeled data for downstream adaptation, which can be costly. Existing unsupervised methods face challenges like unreliable confidence filtering and underuse of low-confidence samples.

Method: Proposes a dual-model, cross-modal adaptive framework via dual-prompt learning with positive and negative textual prompts, reducing dependency on thresholds or noise assumptions and employs a two-phase collaborative training strategy transitioning from efficient to full fine-tuning.

Result: Conducts extensive evaluations showcasing CoFT's improvements over current unsupervised techniques and even outperforms some few-shot supervised approaches.

Conclusion: CoFT and its enhanced version, CoFT+, successfully enable robust unsupervised adaptation of vision-language models, demonstrating versatility and practicality for downstream applications.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, but adapting them to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines.

*Jin-Chuan Shi,Binhong Ye,Tao Liu,Junzhe He,Yangjinhui Xu,Xiaoyang Liu,Zeju Li,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AGILE, a framework for reconstructing hand-object interactions from videos focusing on robustness and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in reconstructing hand-object interactions for manipulation data and digital twins in robotics by overcoming issues with occlusions and fragile initialization methods.

Method: AGILE employs a Vision-Language Model to enable a generative process for watertight object meshes, replaces SfM with robust anchor-and-track strategies, and integrates contact-aware optimization for physical plausibility.

Result: AGILE demonstrates better global geometric accuracy and stability in hand-object reconstruction tasks, outperforming prior methods on challenging datasets like HO3D, DexYCB, and wild videos.

Conclusion: AGILE offers a robust and physically valid approach to reconstructing hand-object interactions for applications in simulations and robotics, validated through real-to-sim retargeting.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

*Qian-Wei Wang,Yaguang Song,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust active learning framework for adapting pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP to image classification tasks under limited annotation conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the adaptation of pre-trained vision-language models under restricted annotation budgets by proposing a better uncertainty modeling framework for guiding sample selection in active learning.

Method: A dual-prompt tuning strategy in CLIP's textual branch with positive and negative prompts to enhance classification reliability and model uncertainty explicitly, guiding active sample selection.

Result: Experiments show that this method consistently outperforms existing active learning approaches in settings with limited annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses active learning challenges for vision-language models, offering consistent performance gains under annotation constraints.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Memory Object (NeMO), a method for detecting, segmenting, and estimating the pose of unseen objects using RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve scalability and efficiency in object perception, especially with unseen objects, without extensive retraining or preprocessing.

Method: The approach uses an encoder that generates a sparse object-like point cloud from a few RGB templates and a decoder that predicts dense outputs from this encoding and a query image.

Result: The method achieves competitive and state-of-the-art performance on BOP benchmark datasets across multiple perception tasks.

Conclusion: NeMO facilitates few-shot object perception, enhancing adaptability and efficiency by enabling interaction with novel objects without requiring camera-specific parameters or retraining.

Abstract: We present Neural Memory Object (NeMO), a novel object-centric representation that can be used to detect, segment and estimate the 6DoF pose of objects unseen during training using RGB images. Our method consists of an encoder that requires only a few RGB template views depicting an object to generate a sparse object-like point cloud using a learned UDF containing semantic and geometric information. Next, a decoder takes the object encoding together with a query image to generate a variety of dense predictions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can be used for few-shot object perception without requiring any camera-specific parameters or retraining on target data. Our proposed concept of outsourcing object information in a NeMO and using a single network for multiple perception tasks enhances interaction with novel objects, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive pre-processing. We report competitive and state-of-the-art results on various datasets and perception tasks of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating the versatility of our approach. https://github.com/DLR-RM/nemo

TL;DR: VecSet-Edit is a groundbreaking mesh editing pipeline leveraging the high-fidelity VecSet model to provide precise, image-guided editing without labor-intensive 3D masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D editing techniques fail to effectively address mesh editing due to reliance on voxel-based representations with limited resolution and complex masks. This paper aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: VecSet-Edit utilizes the VecSet Reconstruction Model to analyze spatial properties of tokens for geometric localization. It includes strategies like Mask-guided Token Seeding, Attention-aligned Token Gating, Drift-aware Token Pruning, and Detail-preserving Texture Baking.

Result: The presented methodologies enable high-fidelity and geometric-accurate mesh editing guided by 2D image conditions, minimizing errors and preserving textural details.

Conclusion: VecSet-Edit successfully pioneers efficient and precise 3D mesh editing using innovative techniques, advancing the field of 3D asset control and manipulation.

Abstract: 3D editing has emerged as a critical research area to provide users with flexible control over 3D assets. While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

*Jaehyun Kwak,Nam Cao,Boryeong Cho,Segyu Lee,Sumyeong Ahn,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), a method to effectively generate adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models by targeting high-attention regions with optimized perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing vulnerabilities in LVLMs regarding adversarial attacks, particularly focusing on spatially efficient perturbations that maximize impact while minimizing detectability.

Method: The method relies on leveraging regional attention scores to progressively target high-sensitivity regions with perturbations, improving their efficiency and exploiting the re-distribution of attention during attacks.

Result: SAGA achieves state-of-the-art success rates in adversarial attacks across ten LVLMs while creating imperceptible perturbations.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient adversarial attacks by optimizing perturbation placement, showcasing both effectiveness and imperceptibility, and highlights a critical vulnerability in LVLMs.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparVAR is a training-free framework that accelerates Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling while preserving image quality using sparse attention techniques, reducing image generation time significantly without skipping high-resolution scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency in Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling due to the quadratic increase in computational complexity as resolution scales grow, and resolve the loss of high-frequency details caused by current acceleration methods.

Method: Develop a sparse attention mechanism leveraging strong attention sinks, cross-scale activation similarity, and locality in VAR attention. Propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel.

Result: SparVAR achieves over 5x faster forward speed than FlashAttention, reducing the 8B model's high-resolution image generation time to around 1 second, with a 1.57x speed-up over FlashAttention while preserving image quality.

Conclusion: SparVAR significantly accelerates VAR modeling without sacrificing image quality, presenting a practical and efficient solution for high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UltraSeg, an ultralight polyp segmentation model with fewer than 0.3M parameters designed for resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation models for colorectal cancer require high computational power (GPUs) which limits their deployment in primary hospitals and portable medical equipment.

Method: The authors designed the UltraSeg models by optimizing encoder-decoder architectures, employing constrained dilated convolutions, and introducing a lightweight fusion module to maintain high accuracy with minimal computational demand.

Result: UltraSeg-108K and UltraSeg-130K models achieve 90 FPS on a CPU core and retain >94% Dice score of a large U-Net, evaluated across seven datasets.

Conclusion: UltraSeg provides a clinically viable solution for polyp segmentation in resource-constrained environments and serves as a reproducible benchmark for compressed medical image processing applications.

Abstract: Early detection of colorectal cancer hinges on real-time, accurate polyp identification and resection. Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future benchmarking.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ISFM framework for Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF), enhancing fusion through interactive spatial-frequency features and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMIF methods lack effective interaction between spatial and frequency domain features, limiting performance.

Method: The ISFM framework consists of: (1) a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) for features with linear computational complexity, (2) Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF) for integrating frequency components, and (3) Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF) for cross-modal feature enhancement.

Result: Experiments on six MMIF datasets showed ISFM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in performance.

Conclusion: ISFM demonstrates a novel and effective approach to MMIF by leveraging interactive spatial-frequency features and enhancing image fusion quality.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address insufficient fidelity in human body restoration (HBR) from degraded human-centric images, especially prevalent in existing approaches.

Method: The proposed LCUDiff uses a stable one-step framework that upgrades from a 4-channel to a 16-channel latent space. Key techniques include channel splitting distillation (CSD), prior-preserving adaptation (PPA), and decoder router (DeR) for adaptive decoding.

Result: LCUDiff achieves competitive restoration results with higher fidelity, fewer artifacts, and improved visual quality under mild degradations in synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: LCUDiff offers effective restoration with improved fidelity using innovative techniques in latent diffusion and decoding, while maintaining one-step efficiency.

Abstract: Existing methods for restoring degraded human-centric images often struggle with insufficient fidelity, particularly in human body restoration (HBR). Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive benchmark for federated learning in medical multimodal tasks, including diverse datasets, modalities, tasks, and scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating medical multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods, which hinders systematic development and understanding.

Method: The authors created Med-MMFL, a benchmark that evaluates six federated learning algorithms across various datasets, modalities (e.g., text, images, ECGs, radiology reports), and settings (naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID).

Result: Med-MMFL allows for assessing segmentation, classification, retrieval, and VQA tasks in realistic medical contexts, providing diverse and representative test cases for MMFL methods.

Conclusion: The benchmark will facilitate reproducibility, fair comparison, and systematic development of MMFL approaches in the medical domain, addressing the gap in standardized evaluation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks. To support reproducibility and fair comparison of future multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods under realistic medical settings, we release the complete benchmark implementation, including data processing and partitioning pipelines, at https://github.com/bhattarailab/Med-MMFL-Benchmark .

*Xingyu Miao,Weiguang Zhao,Tao Lu,Linning Yu,Mulin Yu,Yang Long,Jiangmiao Pang,Junting Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TrajVG, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction in videos that tackles challenges caused by object motion and cross-frame misalignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address degradation in multi-frame 3D reconstruction for videos with object motion, where current approaches face challenges like trajectory ambiguity, alignment issues, and structural duplications.

Method: The paper introduces TrajVG, a framework using explicit 3D trajectory predictions, sparse trajectories, local pointmaps, and camera poses combined with geometric consistency objectives, reformulated into self-supervised objectives for training with limited trajectory labels.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that TrajVG outperforms existing baselines in tasks like 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth.

Conclusion: TrajVG significantly improves feed-forward 3D reconstruction in dynamic video settings, providing effective handling of object motion and enabling scalable training with mixed supervision.

Abstract: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynthVerse, a diverse synthetic dataset for improving point tracking by addressing limitations of existing datasets in terms of diversity and trajectory annotations, and evaluates its impact on state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point tracking progress is limited by the lack of diverse, high-quality datasets with perfect trajectory annotations. Existing datasets fail to cover certain domains and object types essential for general point tracking.

Method: The authors created SynthVerse, a large-scale synthetic dataset encompassing diverse domains such as animated-film content, scene navigation, and articulated objects, along with a point tracking benchmark for systematic evaluation.

Result: Training on SynthVerse improves generalization for point trackers and highlights limitations of existing methods in handling broader domain shifts.

Conclusion: SynthVerse facilitates robust training and evaluation for general point tracking by addressing diversity and annotation quality, driving progress in the field under complex and varied conditions.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to follow visual points through complex motion, occlusion, and viewpoint changes, and has advanced rapidly with modern foundation models. Yet progress toward general point tracking remains constrained by limited high-quality data, as existing datasets often provide insufficient diversity and imperfect trajectory annotations. To this end, we introduce SynthVerse, a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for point tracking. SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.

*Tianming Liang,Qirui Du,Jian-Fang Hu,Haichao Jiang,Zicheng Lin,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Seg-ReSearch, a new segmentation method integrating reasoning with external search to handle dynamic and open-world segmentation queries, surpassing prior systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of segmentation systems constrained by the static, frozen internal knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which challenges their adaptability in real-world scenarios involving dynamic or specialized information.

Method: Seg-ReSearch integrates interleaved reasoning with an external search capability. The training process incorporates a hierarchical reward system to balance initial guidance with continuous incentives, addressing challenges in producing effective training signals.

Result: Seg-ReSearch achieves superior performance on the proposed OK-VOS benchmark (focused on outside knowledge for video object segmentation) and other reasoning-based segmentation benchmarks, showcasing a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Seg-ReSearch represents a paradigm shift by overcoming knowledge limitations of existing MLLM-based segmentation systems through reasoning and external search, enabling better adaptability to dynamic, open-world tasks. Results confirm its significant advantages.

Abstract: Segmentation based on language has been a popular topic in computer vision. While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/Seg-ReSearch.

*Timothy Schaumlöffel,Arthur Aubret,Gemma Roig,Jochen Triesch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how central vision and temporal slowness in humans contribute to semantic object representation learning using a simulation of visual experiences and gaze prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms by which humans develop semantic object representations from natural, egocentric visual experiences.

Method: Simulated five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset, employed a gaze prediction model to generate gaze coordinates, and trained a time-contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) model on crops mimicking central vision.

Result: Combining temporal slowness and central vision significantly improved semantic object representations; central vision improved foreground feature extraction, and temporal slowness helped encode broader semantic information.

Conclusion: The study reveals how central vision and temporal slowness play complementary roles in forming semantic object representations, providing insights into human-like visual learning processes.

Abstract: Humans acquire semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision. Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.

*Junjie Li,Congyang Ou,Haokui Zhang,Guoting Wei,Shengqin Jiang,Ying Li,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD-Pan proposes a more efficient, sensor-agnostic approach to pansharpening using latent space diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing diffusion models for pansharpening suffer from high latency and sensor-specific limitations, prompting the need for a versatile and efficient method.

Method: SALAD-Pan trains a VAE to encode HRMS into latent representations, integrates spectral properties with PAN/MS imagery in diffusion, and applies cross-spectral attention for improved consistency.

Result: Experiments on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 show improved precision, 2-3x faster inference, and robust zero-shot cross-sensor capability.

Conclusion: SALAD-Pan provides an efficient and accurate pansharpening method that generalizes across different sensors, addressing current limitations.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models bring novel insights for Pan-sharpening and notably boost fusion precision. However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR) to improve multi-step reasoning in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by addressing visual information loss during long-context generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with extensive multi-step reasoning due to progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation.

Method: VaLR dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each reasoning step, aligning intermediate embeddings with vision encoders to preserve visual knowledge.

Result: Empirical tests show VaLR consistently outperforms other methods in benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or visual perception. It improves VSI-Bench performance from 33.0% to 52.9%, surpassing Qwen2.5-VL by 19.9%.

Conclusion: VaLR enhances reasoning abilities in MLLMs by maintaining visual knowledge, enabling better performance on tasks requiring long reasoning steps and precise visual understanding.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles challenges in mapping informal settlements in urban areas using a new benchmark dataset and a semi-supervised segmentation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid urban expansion has led to the growth of informal settlements, creating a need for accurate large-scale mapping despite challenges like annotation scarcity and data noise.

Method: The authors introduced a benchmark dataset for settlements in Lahore, Karachi, and Mumbai along with a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework. Their framework uses Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding and a Prototype Bank System to mitigate class imbalance and feature degradation.

Result: Experiments across eight cities globally show the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in semi-supervised learning approaches and achieves remarkable domain transfer performance.

Conclusion: The semi-supervised approach presented is highly effective for mapping informal settlements, offering better scalability and robustness compared to fully supervised models.

Abstract: Rapid urban expansion has fueled the growth of informal settlements in major cities of low- and middle-income countries, with Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Mumbai in India serving as prominent examples. However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.

*Cem Eteke,Enzo Tartaglione*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NiFi, a compression method for 3D Gaussian Splatting that preserves high visual quality even at extremely low data rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the space inefficiency and artifacts generated by current 3DGS compression methods, especially at low rates.

Method: Proposed 'NiFi,' a diffusion-based one-step distillation method designed to restore compressed 3DGS with awareness of artifacts.

Result: NiFi achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality for 3DGS compression at extremely low rates, handling compression down to 0.1 MB.

Conclusion: NiFi delivers revolutionary 3DGS compression with up to 1000x rate improvement while preserving high-quality visuals, promising practical applications in real-time and immersive settings.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) revolutionized novel view rendering. Instead of inferring from dense spatial points, as implicit representations do, 3DGS uses sparse Gaussians. This enables real-time performance but increases space requirements, hindering applications such as immersive communication. 3DGS compression emerged as a field aimed at alleviating this issue. While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates, down to 0.1 MB, and towards 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DU-VLM, a multimodal model focused on understanding and predicting visual degradations while also enabling image restoration through diffusion models. A new dataset, DU-110k, is introduced, and extensive experiments validate its superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inability of existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the parametric physics underpinning image degradations, an essential task in computer vision.

Method: The authors redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, train DU-VLM using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with structured rewards, and use it as a zero-shot controller for diffusion models. The DU-110k dataset serves as a foundation for this training.

Result: DU-VLM outperforms generalist baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness, showing strong generalization capabilities even to unseen data distributions. The approach also enables high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative model.

Conclusion: DU-VLM effectively bridges the gap in understanding complex visual degradations, offering a robust model for predictive and restoration tasks while contributing to the field with the DU-110k dataset.

Abstract: Understanding visual degradations is a critical yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms generalist baselines in both accuracy and robustness, exhibiting generalization to unseen distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PEPR, a method that uses event camera data during training to enhance RGB models' robustness to domain shifts, focusing on predictive latent space training rather than direct feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts significantly impact visual perception tasks using deep neural networks, which hinders deployment in real-world, varying conditions.

Method: The authors propose Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), leveraging event cameras as privileged information during training. PEPR avoids direct feature alignment and instead trains the RGB model to predict event-based latent features, enhancing robustness without losing semantics.

Result: The PEPR framework shows superior robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts in RGB models, outperforming traditional alignment-based baselines in object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates how cross-modal learning, with event-based latent feature predictions, enhances the standalone RGB model's performance under challenging domain shifts.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SalFormer360 is an effective and state-of-the-art solution for saliency estimation in 360-degree videos, validated by its superior performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: Saliency estimation has received growing attention in recent years due to its importance in a wide range of applications. In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient model for imaging mass cytometry that can handle varying marker sets in large-scale spatial tissue profiling by overcoming the limitations of standard vision backbones.

Method: It introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions for generating convolutional kernels from marker embeddings and pretrains on a large dataset (IMC17M) using self-supervised masked reconstruction.

Result: ImmuVis surpasses state-of-the-art models in virtual staining and classification tasks while being more computationally efficient and capable of calibrated uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: ImmuVis is a practical and efficient foundation model for addressing real-world imaging mass cytometry challenges.

Abstract: We present ImmuVis, an efficient convolutional foundation model for imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a high-throughput multiplex imaging technology that handles molecular marker measurements as image channels and enables large-scale spatial tissue profiling. Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.

Result: PIO-FVLM retains 11.1% of visual tokens while maintaining 97.2% of original model performance, achieving significant speedups, lower computational costs, and reduced memory usage.

Conclusion: PIO-FVLM effectively compresses visual tokens, improving VLM inference efficiency while being training-free and practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

*Sijia Chen,Lijuan Ma,Yanqiu Yu,En Yu,Liman Liu,Wenbing Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT) to enhance tracking of targets using RGB, Depth, and Language. A new dataset DRSet and the DRTrack framework are proposed for 3D-aware tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RMOT models depend solely on 2D RGB data, which struggles with complex spatial semantics and occlusions due to lack of 3D spatial information.

Method: The paper develops DRMOT to merge RGB, Depth, and Language modalities for tracking. It also introduces a new tailored dataset, DRSet, and a tracking framework, DRTrack, using MLLM-guided depth-referring techniques.

Result: Experiments show DRTrack's effectiveness in spatial-semantic grounding and tracking within the DRSet dataset.

Conclusion: RGBD integration enhances RMOT tasks by addressing spatial semantic challenges and improving tracking reliability. DRTrack and DRSet contribute to advancing research in this area.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using vision language models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space-related applications face challenges in data annotation due to factors like low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds.

Method: The approach involves generating pseudo-labels using a pre-trained VLM for a subset of data and then training lightweight models via a teacher-student label distillation framework.

Result: The method demonstrates up to 10-point improvements in average precision (AP) on datasets such as SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO for segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The annotation-free pipeline effectively improves spacecraft and orbital target segmentation, showing potential for space applications while reducing dependence on manual labeling.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

*David F. Ramirez,Tim Overman,Kristen Jaskie,Joe Marvin,Andreas Spanias*

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI agent named SAR-RAG for improving automatic target recognition in SAR images using multimodal language models and a vector database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the automatic recognition and differentiation of military vehicles in SAR images, addressing challenges posed by their indistinguishable appearance.

Method: The SAR-RAG agent integrates a multimodal large language model with a vector database for semantic retrieval of past image examples and employs contextual search techniques.

Result: Metrics show that the addition of SAR-RAG improves categorical classification, regression accuracy, and retrieval tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: SAR-RAG demonstrates enhanced recognition performance by leveraging contextual memory banks and semantic image retrieval, showcasing potential advancements in SAR-based ATR systems.

Abstract: We present a visual-context image retrieval-augmented generation (ImageRAG) assisted AI agent for automatic target recognition (ATR) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.

*Gonçalo P. Matos,Carlos Santiago,João P. Costeira,Ricardo L. Saldanha,Ernesto M. Morgado*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses tracking fruit growth through time by introducing a new paradigm using constellations of 3D centroids for matching fruits across videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking fruits' growth enhances precision agriculture by predicting fruit setting and yield, but current manual methods are labor-intensive and non-scalable.

Method: The authors propose a descriptor for sparse 3D point clouds to match constellations of fruits across videos. This method avoids reliance on rigid camera setups and handles occlusions efficiently.

Result: The method successfully matches fruits through different videos and aids in generating orchard maps for autonomous navigation and selective fruit picking.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable tracking of fruits over time and improves robotic applications in agriculture, including autonomous navigation and fruit picking.

Abstract: Following crop growth through the vegetative cycle allows farmers to predict fruit setting and yield in early stages, but it is a laborious and non-scalable task if performed by a human who has to manually measure fruit sizes with a caliper or dendrometers. In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.

*Buddhi Wijenayake,Nichula Wasalathilake,Roshan Godaliyadda,Vijitha Herath,Parakrama Ekanayake,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework using prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation for semantic segmentation in remote sensing, addressing long-tailed class distribution and urban/rural domain issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in semantic segmentation of remote-sensing imagery caused by long-tailed class imbalance, especially in datasets like LoveDA with distinct Urban/Rural domains.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework: (1) A diffusion model generating domain-aware class-balanced layouts (Stage A), and (2) a photorealistic image synthesis using ControlNet and Stable Diffusion (Stage B), with explicit control over domain and class composition.

Result: The proposed method improves segmentation performance, particularly for minority classes, and enhances urban and rural generalization when synthetic data is mixed with real-world data across different segmentation backbones.

Conclusion: The controllable augmentation framework demonstrates the effectiveness of mitigating long-tail biases in remote-sensing segmentation, providing a practical solution with public resources available for replication.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery is critical for urban mapping and land-cover monitoring, yet training data typically exhibits severe long-tailed pixel imbalance. In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation.

*Chengtao Lv,Yumeng Shi,Yushi Huang,Ruihao Gong,Shen Ren,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Light Forcing', a sparse attention method designed for autoregressive (AR) video generation models, achieving improved performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR video generation is hindered by the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, necessitating efficient sparse attention solutions tailored to AR models.

Method: The method, 'Light Forcing', introduces a Chunk-Aware Growth mechanism to allocate sparsity progressively and a Hierarchical Sparse Attention method to capture historical and local context effectively.

Result: 'Light Forcing' outperforms existing methods with better video generation quality and speedup, achieving impressive experimental results such as a $2.3×$ speedup and 19.7 FPS on RTX 5090 GPU.

Conclusion: The proposed solution offers an efficient and effective sparse attention mechanism for AR video generation, significantly improving both quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive (AR) video generation models have improved visual fidelity and interactivity, but the quadratic complexity of attention remains a primary bottleneck for efficient deployment. While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study unveils VISTA-Bench, a new benchmark identifying a significant performance gap in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) between understanding pure-text and visualized-text inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs excel in pure-text input tasks but are likely limited in their ability to handle textual content embedded within images, a common real-world scenario.

Method: The authors propose VISTA-Bench, a benchmark testing VLMs' understanding of text in both pure-text and visualized-text forms under controlled visual conditions, evaluating over 20 models.

Result: Findings revealed a major 'modality gap': VLMs, strong on pure-text tasks, struggle with visualized-text inputs, further affected by rendering complexities.

Conclusion: VISTA-Bench highlights the need for improved VLMs capable of unified understanding across text modalities, serving as a diagnostic and guiding tool for future advancements.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

*Ronghuan Wu,Wanchao Su,Kede Ma,Jing Liao,Rafał K. Mantiuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research adapts pretrained diffusion models for HDR image generation, addressing the challenges of handling HDR's linear RGB representation and improving perceptual fidelity and image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generation models are limited to LDR outputs due to insufficient HDR training data. This study seeks to overcome these limitations for HDR generation.

Method: The researchers convert HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings like PU21, freeze the VAE, and finetune the denoiser using low-rank adaptation to enable HDR image synthesis and reconstruction.

Result: Their strategy consistently achieves better perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and dynamic range compared to prior techniques.

Conclusion: HDR image generation can be effectively achieved by adapting existing pretrained models without complete retraining, leveraging perceptually uniform encodings for efficient processing.

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an ultra-lightweight deep learning model, XtraLight-MedMamba, for precise classification of precancerous tubular adenomas from pathology slides, achieving notable accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for identifying low-grade dysplasia in colonoscopy screenings are subjective and limited. There is a need for more accurate risk stratification to reduce colorectal cancer development.

Method: The proposed framework combines ConvNext shallow feature extraction, vision mamba modules, SCAB module for multiscale enhancement, and FNOClassifier for parameter reduction. It classifies neoplastic tubular adenomas using deep learning techniques.

Result: XtraLight-MedMamba achieved 97.18% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9767, outperforming existing architectures while using only 32,000 parameters.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates potential for advancing digital pathology and improving colorectal cancer risk stratification with high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.

TL;DR: This paper develops an AI model for identifying nail diseases using image classification, achieving 95.57% accuracy with InceptionV3 among multiple CNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nail diseases are often overlooked until they worsen, and early detection is critical because they can provide insights into overall health.

Method: The authors trained and tested four CNN models (InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, ResNet50) on a dataset of 3,835 resized nail disease images, incorporating adversarial training and SHAP for robust classifications.

Result: InceptionV3 achieved the highest accuracy (95.57%), followed by DenseNet201 (94.79%). The SHAP method was applied for feature interpretation.

Conclusion: The system enhances nail disease diagnostics and aids doctors by offering faster and more precise evaluations.

Abstract: Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents LitS, a robust neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds, enhancing geometry analysis and addressing data challenges like variability and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the analysis and structural understanding of 3D point cloud data, which serves as a crucial representation for spatial applications but lacks versatile neighborhood descriptors for accurate local geometry characterization.

Method: LitS is introduced as a piecewise constant function on the unit circle, associated with a local reference system. It offers 'regular' and 'cumulative' versions and parameters to adapt to diverse point cloud contexts. It analyzes the number of neighbors within cone-like areas to understand local structures.

Result: LitS effectively captures local neighborhood nuances, provides structural insights, and demonstrates resilience to point cloud challenges such as variable density and noise.

Conclusion: LitS is a versatile and robust descriptor for point clouds, enabling improved local and global geometric analysis across a variety of applications.

Abstract: With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, with applications that span across various scientific and technological fields. Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mask-LLaVA, a framework for Vision Language Models that reduces the dependence on numerous visual tokens, offering efficient and compact representation without loss of performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the computational inefficiency posed by the large number of visual tokens typically required in Vision Language Models, particularly during inference.

Method: The authors propose leveraging mask-based object representations alongside global and local patch tokens, enabling dynamic reduction in the number of tokens during inference without retraining the model.

Result: The framework demonstrates competitive performance against token-efficient methods and original LLaVA baseline using significantly fewer visual tokens across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mask-LLaVA combines multi-level features for efficient learning, enabling dynamic token selection at inference for maintaining strong performance with fewer tokens.

Abstract: Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.

*Ramón Calvo-González,François Fleuret*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents FlatDINO, a method compressing DINO-style features for more efficient diffusion model image generation with significant computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address computational redundancy in generating images using diffusion models on dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2.

Method: The authors introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder compressing patch grids into compact sequences, reducing both sequence length and dimensionality for image generation.

Result: A diffusion model trained on FlatDINO compressions shows improved efficiency, achieving strong quality metrics (gFID of 1.80) with reduced computational costs in training and inference.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a promising improvement in efficiency through feature compression while maintaining high-quality image generation, with further research indicated as ongoing.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that diffusion models can generate high-quality images by operating directly on SSL patch features rather than pixel-space latents. However, the dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion needlessly expensive. We introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses this representation into a one-dimensional sequence of just 32 continuous tokens -an 8x reduction in sequence length and 48x compression in total dimensionality. On ImageNet 256x256, a DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves a gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features. These are preliminary results and this work is in progress.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PerpetualWonder is a hybrid generative simulator capable of long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image by unifying physical and visual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with coupling visual and physical states, leading to limitations in generating physically plausible, long-horizon scene simulation.

Method: PerpetualWonder introduces a unified representation linking physical state and visual primitives alongside a robust update mechanism that leverages supervision from multiple viewpoints.

Result: Experiments validate PerpetualWonder's ability to simulate multi-step interactions with physical plausibility and visual consistency, all from a single image.

Conclusion: PerpetualWonder provides a novel solution by creating a closed-loop system for consistent and plausible scene generation, extending the capabilities of long-horizon simulation from limited initial visual input.

Abstract: We introduce PerpetualWonder, a hybrid generative simulator that enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image. Current works fail at this task because their physical state is decoupled from their visual representation, which prevents generative refinements to update the underlying physics for subsequent interactions. PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

*Zihang Lai,Eldar Insafutdinov,Edgar Sucar,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel dense point tracker utilizing warping and a transformer architecture for long-range correspondences, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense point tracking methods rely on cost volumes, which are computationally expensive due to quadratic complexity. This limits their scalability and efficiency, necessitating alternative approaches.

Method: The proposed method discards cost volumes and utilizes a warping-based approach to iteratively refine track estimates. A transformer architecture is employed for joint spatiotemporal reasoning across tracks, enabling long-range correspondence without feature correlations.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on dense point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. It also performs exceptionally on optical flow benchmarks like Sintel, KITTI, and Spring, sometimes surpassing specialized methods.

Conclusion: Warping-based architectures combined with transformer reasoning can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation, offering a scalable and efficient solution without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.

### [191] [Pending Conflicts Make Progress Impossible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04013)
*Petr Kuznetsov,Pierre Sutra,Guillermo Toyos-Marfurt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a concept called conflict-obstruction-freedom, which enables parallel execution of commuting operations but proves that universal constructions under this condition are infeasible in asynchronous shared memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance improvements by leveraging the parallel nature of commuting operations while exploring their fundamental limitations.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of conflict-obstruction-freedom and theoretically analyzes its feasibility in asynchronous read-write shared memory models.

Result: It is proven that conflict-obstruction-free universal constructions cannot be implemented in the asynchronous shared memory model, highlighting synchronization costs caused by conflicting operations.

Conclusion: While conflict-obstruction-freedom enhances parallel execution, its limitations in asynchronous environments underline the necessity of synchronization for resolving conflicts.

Abstract: In this work, we study progress conditions for commutativity-aware, linearizable implementations of shared objects. Motivated by the observation that commuting operations can be executed in parallel, we introduce conflict-obstruction-freedom: a process is guaranteed to complete its operation if it runs for long enough without encountering step contention with conflicting (non-commuting) operations. This condition generalizes obstruction-freedom and wait-freedom by allowing progress as long as step contention is only induced by commuting operations. We prove that conflict-obstruction-free universal constructions are impossible to implement in the asynchronous read-write shared memory model. This result exposes a fundamental limitation of conflict-aware universal constructions: the mere invocation of conflicting operations imposes a synchronization cost. Progress requires eventual resolution of pending conflicts.

### [192] [Six Times to Spare: LDPC Acceleration on DGX Spark for AI-Native Open RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04652)
*Ryan Barker,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the advantages of offloading 5G-style LDPC decoding from CPU to GPU, showing significant speed and resource efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 5G LDPC decoding on CPUs struggles to meet the stringent timing requirements within increasing computational demands, driving the need to assess performance on alternate architectures.

Method: An empirical study using an NVIDIA DGX Spark platform to compare CPU and GPU decoding speeds, leveraging TensorFlow-based implementations and measuring throughput, latency, power, and resource use.

Result: GPU-based LDPC decoding achieves an average 6x speedup in throughput over CPU, with better latency and reduced resource consumption, showcasing potential efficiency in offloading tasks.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration not only meets 5G decoding requirements but also reduces CPU load and provides a scalable solution for future high-performance demands, offering a reusable evaluation framework for related tasks.

Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding is one of the most computationally intensive kernels in the 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer and must complete within a 0.5\,ms transmission time interval while sharing the budget with FFT, channel estimation, demapping, HARQ, and MAC scheduling. Many open and proprietary stacks still execute LDPC on general-purpose CPUs, raising concerns about missed-slot events and limited scalability as bandwidths, modulation orders, and user multiplexing increase. This paper empirically quantifies the benefit of offloading 5G-style LDPC5G decoding from a Grace CPU to the integrated Blackwell GB10 GPU on an NVIDIA DGX~Spark platform. Using NVIDIA Sionna PHY/SYS on TensorFlow, we construct an NR-like link-level chain with an LDPC5G encoder/decoder, 16-QAM modulation, and AWGN, and sweep both the number of codewords decoded in parallel and the number of belief-propagation iterations, timing only the decoding phase while logging CPU and GPU utilization and power. Across the sweep we observe an average GPU/CPU throughput speedup of approximately $6\times$, with per-codeword CPU latency reaching $\approx 0.71$\,ms at 20 iterations (exceeding the 0.5\,ms slot), while the GB10 GPU remains within 6--24\% of the slot for the same workloads. Resource-usage measurements show that CPU-based LDPC decoding often consumes around ten Grace cores, whereas GPU-based decoding adds only $\approx10-15$\,W over GPU idle while leaving most CPU capacity available for higher-layer tasks. Because our implementation relies on high-level Sionna layers rather than hand-tuned CUDA, these results represent conservative lower bounds on achievable accelerator performance and provide a reusable, scriptable methodology for evaluating LDPC and other physical-layer kernels on future Grace/Blackwell and Aerial/ACAR/AODT platforms.

*Davide Basile,Valerio Goretti,Luca Barbaro,Hajo A. Reijers,Claudio Di Ciccio*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces CONFINE, a framework enabling secure inter-organizational process mining by leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and employing a segmentation strategy for secure data exchange without compromising secrecy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address confidentiality challenges in inter-organizational process mining, as conventional methods may expose sensitive information during analysis.

Method: The proposed method, CONFINE, uses TEEs to securely mine multi-party event logs while maintaining data confidentiality. It introduces a four-stage protocol for secure data transfer and processing and employs a segmentation-based approach to handle TEEs' memory limitations.

Result: Through formal verification, security analysis, and testing on real-world and synthetic data, CONFINE demonstrates logarithmic memory growth with event log size and linear growth with participating organizations, confirming its scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: CONFINE offers a practical, scalable solution for secrecy-preserving inter-organizational process mining, with potential for optimization and broader application to address real-world confidentiality concerns.

Abstract: Process mining techniques enable organizations to gain insights into their business processes through the analysis of execution records (event logs) stored by information systems. While most process mining efforts focus on intra-organizational scenarios, many real-world business processes span multiple independent organizations. Inter-organizational process mining, though, faces significant challenges, particularly regarding confidentiality guarantees: The analysis of data can reveal information that the participating organizations may not consent to disclose to one another, or to a third party hosting process mining services. To overcome this issue, this paper presents CONFINE, an approach for secrecy-preserving inter-organizational process mining. CONFINE leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deploy trusted applications that are capable of securely mining multi-party event logs while preserving data secrecy. We propose an architecture supporting a four-stage protocol to secure data exchange and processing, allowing for protected transfer and aggregation of unaltered process data across organizational boundaries. To avoid out-of-memory errors due to the limited capacity of TEEs, our protocol employs a segmentation-based strategy, whereby event logs are transmitted to TEEs in smaller batches. We conduct a formal verification of correctness and a security analysis of the guarantees provided by the TEE core. We evaluate our implementation on real-world and synthetic data, showing that the proposed approach can handle realistic workloads. The results indicate logarithmic memory growth with respect to the event log size and linear growth with the number of provisioning organizations, highlighting scalability properties and opportunities for further optimization.

### [194] [Understanding the Impact of Differentially Private Training on Memorization of Long-Tailed Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03872)
*Jiaming Zhang,Huanyi Xie,Meng Ding,Shaopeng Fu,Jinyan Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework analyzing why the differential privacy algorithm DP-SGD often underperforms on long-tailed datasets. The authors find DP-SGD's mechanisms hinder learning of underrepresented data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep learning models' tendency to memorize training samples raises privacy concerns, prompting the use of differentially private training algorithms like DP-SGD. However, DP-SGD often performs poorly with long-tailed data, which contains many rare samples, and this limitation lacks theoretical understanding.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework analyzing differential private algorithm DP-SGD through a feature learning lens, explaining its inefficiency with long-tailed datasets. They examine how gradient clipping and noise injections impede learning underrepresented data.

Result: The study shows that DP-SGD-trained models have higher errors on long-tailed dataset subsets compared to overall datasets and identifies how DP-SGD's mechanisms hamper its ability to learn rare yet informative samples.

Conclusion: DP-SGD, despite its privacy-preserving benefits, struggles with generalization on long-tailed data because of its mechanisms. The findings offer insights for addressing this trade-off and are validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Recent research shows that modern deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy partly by memorizing individual training samples. Such memorization raises serious privacy concerns, motivating the widespread adoption of differentially private training algorithms such as DP-SGD. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that DP-SGD often leads to suboptimal generalization performance, particularly on long-tailed data that contain a large number of rare or atypical samples. Despite these observations, a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, and existing differential privacy analysis are difficult to extend to the nonconvex and nonsmooth neural networks commonly used in practice. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for analyzing DP-SGD on long-tailed data from a feature learning perspective. We show that the test error of DP-SGD-trained models on the long-tailed subpopulation is significantly larger than the overall test error over the entire dataset. Our analysis further characterizes the training dynamics of DP-SGD, demonstrating how gradient clipping and noise injection jointly adversely affect the model's ability to memorize informative but underrepresented samples. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroPareto optimizes multi-objective tasks in high-dimensional spaces using rank filtering, uncertainty management, and an acquisition strategy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of optimizing trade-offs in high-dimensional search spaces under strict computational limitations.

Method: NeuroPareto integrates various strategies like Bayesian classifiers for uncertainty estimation, deep Gaussian Process surrogates, and hierarchical screening to refine predictive outputs without high computational costs.

Result: NeuroPareto demonstrated superior performance in objective proximity and hypervolume on synthetic benchmarks and a subsurface energy task compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves efficient optimization with improved Pareto outcomes and computational affordability for complex tasks.

Abstract: The pursuit of optimal trade-offs in high-dimensional search spaces under stringent computational constraints poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary multi-objective optimization. We develop NeuroPareto, a cohesive architecture that integrates rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition strategies to navigate complex objective landscapes. A calibrated Bayesian classifier estimates epistemic uncertainty across non-domination tiers, enabling rapid generation of high-quality candidates with minimal evaluation cost. Deep Gaussian Process surrogates further separate predictive uncertainty into reducible and irreducible components, providing refined predictive means and risk-aware signals for downstream selection. A lightweight acquisition network, trained online from historical hypervolume improvements, guides expensive evaluations toward regions balancing convergence and diversity. With hierarchical screening and amortized surrogate updates, the method maintains accuracy while keeping computational overhead low. Experiments on DTLZ and ZDT suites and a subsurface energy extraction task show that NeuroPareto consistently outperforms classifier-enhanced and surrogate-assisted baselines in Pareto proximity and hypervolume.

*Stefan Kuhn,Vandana Dwarka,Przemyslaw Karol Grenda,Eero Vainikko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR is proposed, using a single invertible neural network for both molecular structure and spectrum inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the prediction of NMR spectra and the uncertainty-aware generation of molecular structures into a single, efficient model.

Method: The method uses an invertible neural network based on i-RevNet, trained to map molecular structures to binned spectrum codes while capturing residual variability.

Result: The model achieves invertibility, effective spectrum-code prediction, and generates structurally meaningful signals from spectra on validation data.

Conclusion: Invertible neural networks offer a unified, efficient approach to spectrum prediction and structure inference for 13C NMR applications.

Abstract: We introduce a reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR that uses a single conditional invertible neural network for both directions between molecular structures and spectra. The network is built from i-RevNet style bijective blocks, so the forward map and its inverse are available by construction. We train the model to predict a 128-bit binned spectrum code from a graph-based structure encoding, while the remaining latent dimensions capture residual variability. At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.

*Thomas Uriot,Elise Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust non-linear PCA framework that combines PCA interpretability with the flexibility of neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA struggles with capturing non-linear structures in data while Kernel PCA loses interpretability and faces hyperparameter selection difficulties.

Method: The method parametrizes transformations via neural networks, optimized using ES for non-differentiable eigendecomposition, and introduces a variance-maximizing objective function compatible with categorical data.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms linear PCA and kPCA in explained variance on synthetic and real-world datasets while preserving PCA's interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the explained variance of PCA while maintaining interpretability, offering practical tools for visualization and handling diverse data types.

Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful and popular dimensionality reduction technique. However, due to its linear nature, it often fails to capture the complex underlying structure of real-world data. While Kernel PCA (kPCA) addresses non-linearity, it sacrifices interpretability and struggles with hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose a robust non-linear PCA framework that unifies the interpretability of PCA with the flexibility of neural networks. Our method parametrizes variable transformations via neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES) to handle the non-differentiability of eigendecomposition. We introduce a novel, granular objective function that maximizes the individual variance contribution of each variable providing a stronger learning signal than global variance maximization. This approach natively handles categorical and ordinal variables without the dimensional explosion associated with one-hot encoding. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both linear PCA and kPCA in explained variance across synthetic and real-world datasets. At the same time, it preserves PCA's interpretability, enabling visualization and analysis of feature contributions using standard tools such as biplots. The code can be found on GitHub.

*Kyuseong Choi,Dwaipayan Saha,Woojeong Kim,Anish Agarwal,Raaz Dwivedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), a reinforcement learning approach that improves reward alignment by relying on rankings rather than magnitudes, addressing suboptimality in tasks with non-verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reinforcement learning methods do not align well with non-verifiable rewards, leading to inefficiencies in tasks like summarization and chat completion.

Method: GOPO transforms rewards into rank-based data, optimizing policies through ordinal relationships instead of relying on absolute reward values.

Result: GOPO shows better reward trajectories, faster training convergence, and improved large language model evaluations compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: Replacing magnitude-based optimization with rank-based approaches resolves misalignments in non-verifiable reward settings, consistently enhancing reinforcement learning outcomes.

Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) trains a reward model on pairwise preference data and then uses it for policy optimization. However, while reward models are optimized to capture relative preferences, existing policy optimization techniques rely on absolute reward magnitudes during training. In settings where the rewards are non-verifiable such as summarization, instruction following, and chat completion, this misalignment often leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), a policy optimization method that uses only the ranking of the rewards and discards their magnitudes. Our rank-based transformation of rewards provides several gains, compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), in settings with non-verifiable rewards: (1) consistently higher training/validation reward trajectories, (2) improved LLM-as-judge evaluations across most intermediate training steps, and (3) reaching a policy of comparable quality in substantially less training steps than GRPO. We demonstrate consistent improvements across a range of tasks and model sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores why neural networks reduce theoretical capacity to effective capacity during gradient descent training through three principles: mutual alignment, unlocking, and racing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the unexplained phenomenon of how gradient descent reduces neural networks' theoretical capacity to fit a task.

Method: They investigate neuron-level dynamics of single hidden layer ReLU networks during gradient descent, identifying key principles and analyzing their effects.

Result: Three dynamical principles were identified: mutual alignment, unlocking, and racing, which explain successful capacity reduction via merging neurons or pruning low norm weights.

Conclusion: These principles provide a mechanism for understanding phenomena like the lottery ticket conjecture and effective capacity reduction in neural networks.

Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.

*Samaresh Kumar Singh,Joyjit Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a system architecture that decouples AI inference from explanation generation, improving efficiency and scalability for edge and IoT deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainable AI approaches are inefficient for edge and IoT systems due to their coupled inference and explanation generation, causing high latency and resource usage. There is a need for a scalable and efficient solution for such deployments.

Method: The proposed XaaS framework decouples explanation generation from inference. Key innovations include a distributed explanation cache with semantic similarity retrieval, a fidelity verification protocol for explanations, and an adaptive explanation engine based on device capabilities and user needs.

Result: XaaS was tested on real-world edge-AI use cases and showed a 38% reduction in latency while maintaining high explanation quality across scenarios in manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare.

Conclusion: XaaS facilitates scalable, transparent, and accountable AI adoption in heterogeneous IoT systems, bridging the gap between explainable AI research and practical edge applications.

Abstract: Though Explainable AI (XAI) has made significant advancements, its inclusion in edge and IoT systems is typically ad-hoc and inefficient. Most current methods are "coupled" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality.

*Weiqi Wang,Zhiyi Tian,Chenhan Zhang,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits the Information Bottleneck (IB) problem using geometric methods, introducing GeoIB to improve stability and compression without estimating mutual information directly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues with traditional IB approaches in deep learning, such as biased estimates and unstable optimization resulting from surrogate methods of mutual information estimation.

Method: The paper proposes GeoIB, which leverages information geometry to directly control compression using Fisher-Rao discrepancy and a Jacobian-Frobenius term, along with natural-gradient optimization consistent with its geometric framework.

Result: GeoIB achieves better prediction-compression trade-off compared to mainstream IB methods, demonstrating improved invariance and stability across experiments on popular datasets.

Conclusion: GeoIB unifies geometric and distributional regularization under a single formalism, enhancing its applicability and robustness in deep learning tasks.

Abstract: Information Bottleneck (IB) is widely used, but in deep learning, it is usually implemented through tractable surrogates, such as variational bounds or neural mutual information (MI) estimators, rather than directly controlling the MI I(X;Z) itself. The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB "compression" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.
  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck (\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier. The source code of GeoIB is released at "https://anonymous.4open.science/r/G-IB-0569".

*Noga Mudrik,Yuxi Chen,Gal Mishne,Adam S. Charles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MILCCI, a method to analyze temporal data from multi-trial observations by capturing label-driven variability and identifying components with label-adjusted temporal traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how metadata labels from different categories influence multi-trial time-series data is challenging, especially in disentangling their distinct contributions.

Method: MILCCI enables sparse per-trial decomposition considering label similarities for cross-trial adjustments, and learns temporal traces that reflect label-driven changes.

Result: MILCCI successfully disentangles category-driven effects and adapts component compositions across trials, demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets like neuroscience data and online trends.

Conclusion: MILCCI is an effective tool for analyzing time-series data with multi-category labels, facilitating better interpretation, variability capture, and cross-trial adjustments.

Abstract: Many fields collect large-scale temporal data through repeated measurements (trials), where each trial is labeled with a set of metadata variables spanning several categories. For example, a trial in a neuroscience study may be linked to a value from category (a): task difficulty, and category (b): animal choice. A critical challenge in time-series analysis is to understand how these labels are encoded within the multi-trial observations, and disentangle the distinct effect of each label entry across categories. Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials. We demonstrate MILCCI's performance through both synthetic and real-world examples, including voting patterns, online page view trends, and neuronal recordings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of target fixing in tabular Q-learning, emphasizing the optimal setting of target update frequency and the bias-variance trade-off involved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The target update frequency in Q-learning is often treated as a tunable hyperparameter without a principled basis. The paper aims to analytically understand and optimize this critical design aspect.

Method: It formulates target updates as periodic nested optimization tasks, focusing on the convergence properties of Q-learning through approximate dynamic programming and stochastic gradient descent.

Result: The study characterizes the bias-variance trade-off for target update periods, showing that adaptive update schedules outperform constant ones in reducing sample complexity.

Conclusion: Adaptive target schedules are optimal for the target update frequency, ensuring improved efficiency while avoiding the overhead incurred by constant update schemes.

Abstract: The target network update frequency (TUF) is a central stabilization mechanism in (deep) Q-learning. However, their selection remains poorly understood and is often treated merely as another tunable hyperparameter rather than as a principled design decision. This work provides a theoretical analysis of target fixing in tabular Q-learning through the lens of approximate dynamic programming. We formulate periodic target updates as a nested optimization scheme in which each outer iteration applies an inexact Bellman optimality operator, approximated by a generic inner loop optimizer. Rigorous theory yields a finite-time convergence analysis for the asynchronous sampling setting, specializing to stochastic gradient descent in the inner loop. Our results deliver an explicit characterization of the bias-variance trade-off induced by the target update period, showing how to optimally set this critical hyperparameter. We prove that constant target update schedules are suboptimal, incurring a logarithmic overhead in sample complexity that is entirely avoidable with adaptive schedules. Our analysis shows that the optimal target update frequency increases geometrically over the course of the learning process.

### [204] [Echo State Networks for Time Series Forecasting: Hyperparameter Sweep and Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03912)
*Alexander Häußer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Echo State Networks (ESNs) for automated univariate time series forecasting using subsets of the M4 dataset, and finds ESNs to be competitive in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional statistical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether a purely feedback-driven Echo State Network (ESN) could act as an efficient and competitive alternative to established statistical forecasting methods for univariate time series analysis.

Method: A two-stage evaluation approach is applied: (1) hyperparameter tuning with a Parameter dataset considering leakage rate, spectral radius, reservoir size, and regularization, resulting in over four million ESN model fits; (2) out-of-sample accuracy testing against benchmarks using metrics MASE and sMAPE.

Result: The ESN shows competitive performance with ARIMA and TBATS for monthly data and outperforms them on quarterly data in MASE accuracy, while being computationally more efficient than complex statistical models.

Conclusion: ESNs represent a practical, efficient, and robust alternative for automated time series forecasting, balancing accuracy and computational cost, especially for quarterly data.

Abstract: This paper investigates the forecasting performance of Echo State Networks (ESNs) for univariate time series forecasting using a subset of the M4 Forecasting Competition dataset. Focusing on monthly and quarterly time series with at most 20 years of historical data, we evaluate whether a fully automatic, purely feedback-driven ESN can serve as a competitive alternative to widely used statistical forecasting methods. The study adopts a rigorous two-stage evaluation approach: a Parameter dataset is used to conduct an extensive hyperparameter sweep covering leakage rate, spectral radius, reservoir size, and information criteria for regularization, resulting in over four million ESN model fits; a disjoint Forecast dataset is then used for out-of-sample accuracy assessment. Forecast accuracy is measured using MASE and sMAPE and benchmarked against simple benchmarks like drift and seasonal naive and statistical models like ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS. The hyperparameter analysis reveals consistent and interpretable patterns, with monthly series favoring moderately persistent reservoirs and quarterly series favoring more contractive dynamics. Across both frequencies, high leakage rates are preferred, while optimal spectral radii and reservoir sizes vary with temporal resolution. In the out-of-sample evaluation, the ESN performs on par with ARIMA and TBATS for monthly data and achieves the lowest mean MASE for quarterly data, while requiring lower computational cost than the more complex statistical models. Overall, the results demonstrate that ESNs offer a compelling balance between predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, positioning them as a practical option for automated time series forecasting.

### [205] [Causal Discovery for Cross-Sectional Data Based on Super-Structure and Divide-and-Conquer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03914)
*Wenyu Wang,Yaping Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient framework for divide-and-conquer causal discovery, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational expense of constructing accurate Super-Structures for divide-and-conquer causal discovery, especially when domain knowledge is lacking, limits its widespread application.

Method: The authors develop a novel framework that uses weakly constrained Super-Structures integrated with optimized graph partitioning and merging strategies to reduce CI test overhead while preserving accuracy.

Result: The proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to existing approaches like PC and FCI with significantly fewer CI tests. Validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, including CHARLS, confirms its scalability and practical utility.

Conclusion: Accurate and scalable causal discovery is feasible, even with minimal Super-Structure assumptions, paving the way for applications in domains like biomedical and social sciences.

Abstract: This paper tackles a critical bottleneck in Super-Structure-based divide-and-conquer causal discovery: the high computational cost of constructing accurate Super-Structures--particularly when conditional independence (CI) tests are expensive and domain knowledge is unavailable. We propose a novel, lightweight framework that relaxes the strict requirements on Super-Structure construction while preserving the algorithmic benefits of divide-and-conquer. By integrating weakly constrained Super-Structures with efficient graph partitioning and merging strategies, our approach substantially lowers CI test overhead without sacrificing accuracy. We instantiate the framework in a concrete causal discovery algorithm and rigorously evaluate its components on synthetic data. Comprehensive experiments on Gaussian Bayesian networks, including magic-NIAB, ECOLI70, and magic-IRRI, demonstrate that our method matches or closely approximates the structural accuracy of PC and FCI while drastically reducing the number of CI tests. Further validation on the real-world China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset confirms its practical applicability. Our results establish that accurate, scalable causal discovery is achievable even under minimal assumptions about the initial Super-Structure, opening new avenues for applying divide-and-conquer methods to large-scale, knowledge-scarce domains such as biomedical and social science research.

*Duc Hoang,Ajay Jaiswal,Mohammad Samragh,Minsik Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new MoE caching strategy called Least-Stale, which achieves significant performance improvements by leveraging predictable access patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently utilizing MoE model sparsity in practical hardware contexts is challenging due to suboptimal caching mechanisms.

Method: A standardized benchmarking framework (SpecMD) and the Least-Stale eviction policy are developed for analyzing and optimizing MoE caching strategies.

Result: The proposed Least-Stale policy reduces cache collision misses by up to 85× and improves hit rates beyond 88%, with up to 34.7% TTFT reduction and minimal VRAM usage.

Conclusion: Leveraging predictable MoE expert access patterns allows for practical gains in performance, demonstrating the potential of the Least-Stale policy in optimizing sparse MoE models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable sparse expert activation, meaning that only a subset of the model's parameters is used during each inference. However, to translate this sparsity into practical performance, an expert caching mechanism is required. Previous works have proposed hardware-centric caching policies, but how these various caching policies interact with each other and different hardware specification remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{SpecMD}, a standardized framework for benchmarking ad-hoc cache policies on various hardware configurations. Using SpecMD, we perform an exhaustive benchmarking of several MoE caching strategies, reproducing and extending prior approaches in controlled settings with realistic constraints. Our experiments reveal that MoE expert access is not consistent with temporal locality assumptions (e.g LRU, LFU). Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{Least-Stale}, a novel eviction policy that exploits MoE's predictable expert access patterns to reduce collision misses by up to $85\times$ over LRU. With such gains, we achieve over $88\%$ hit rates with up to $34.7\%$ Time-to-first-token (TTFT) reduction on OLMoE at only $5\%$ or $0.6GB$ of VRAM cache capacity.

*Nick Alonso,Tomas Figliolia,Beren Millidge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OVQ-attention to balance efficiency and performance in long-context tasks by requiring linear compute costs and constant memory, while achieving competitive results with less memory than self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in sequence mixing layers, particularly the high memory and compute costs of self-attention and the challenges of long-context processing with linear attentions and SSMs.

Method: OVQ-attention leverages sparse memory updates to increase memory capacity, supported by theoretical foundations in Gaussian mixture regression, and is tested against synthetic tasks and language modeling.

Result: OVQ-attention significantly outperforms linear attention baselines and improves upon VQ-attention while achieving results comparable to self-attention baselines up to a sequence length of 64k.

Conclusion: OVQ-attention represents a promising compromise between computational efficiency and long-context processing capabilities, providing substantial advancements over existing methods while utilizing reduced memory.

Abstract: Standard sequence mixing layers used in language models struggle to balance efficiency and performance. Self-attention performs well on long context tasks but has expensive quadratic compute and linear memory costs, while linear attention and SSMs use only linear compute and constant memory but struggle with long context processing. In this paper, we develop a sequence mixing layer that aims to find a better compromise between memory-compute costs and long-context processing, which we call online vector-quantized (OVQ) attention. OVQ-attention requires linear compute costs and constant memory, but, unlike linear attention and SSMs, it uses a sparse memory update that allows it to greatly increase the size of its memory state and, consequently, memory capacity. We develop a theoretical basis for OVQ-attention based on Gaussian mixture regression, and we test it on a variety of synthetic long context tasks and on long context language modeling. OVQ-attention shows significant improvements over linear attention baselines and the original VQ-attention, on which OVQ-attention was inspired. It demonstrates competitive, and sometimes identical, performance to strong self-attention baselines up 64k sequence length, despite using a small fraction of the memory of full self-attention.

*Michael Aich,Andreas Fürst,Florian Sestak,Carlos Ruiz-Gonzalez,Niklas Boers,Johannes Brandstetter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model for atmospheric tasks, capable of handling diverse problems without task-specific fine-tuning, leveraging self-supervised video reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation in weather and climate modeling, where specialized models serve isolated tasks, the research aims to create a unified, task-agnostic foundation model for atmospheric studies.

Method: WIND is pre-trained with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective using an unconditional video diffusion model. Domain-specific problems are formulated as inverse problems solved via posterior sampling.

Result: WIND successfully tackles diverse weather and climate problems such as probabilistic forecasting, downscaling, sparse reconstruction, and conservation laws, while also generating physically consistent extreme weather scenarios under warming.

Conclusion: WIND offers a computationally efficient, unified framework for AI-based atmospheric modeling, combining generative video modeling and inverse problem-solving to replace specialized baselines effectively.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized weather and climate modeling, yet the current landscape remains fragmented: highly specialized models are typically trained individually for distinct tasks. To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios. By combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving, WIND offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift in AI-based atmospheric modeling.

*Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov,Duygu Erisken,Derya Umut Kulali,Taner Yilmaz,Rana Irem Turhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AURA is a multi-agent reinforcement learning system for selecting affordable housing sites quickly, adhering to regulations, and optimizing various objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the global challenge of affordable housing shortages compounded by constraints like land scarcity and regulatory delays.

Method: AURA employs hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning with regulatory-aware state encoding, constrained policy gradients, and reward decomposition.

Result: AURA demonstrated 94.3% regulatory compliance, improved Pareto hypervolume by 37.2%, reduced site selection time significantly, and identified better-performing sites compared to experts.

Conclusion: AURA offers a scalable and effective solution for affordable housing site selection, outperforming traditional methods in compliance and site quality.

Abstract: Affordable housing shortages affect billions, while land scarcity and regulations make site selection slow. We present AURA (Autonomous Urban Resource Allocator), a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning system for real-time affordable housing site selection under hard regulatory constraints (QCT, DDA, LIHTC). We model the task as a constrained multi-objective Markov decision process optimizing accessibility, environmental impact, construction cost, and social equity while enforcing feasibility. AURA uses a regulatory-aware state encoding 127 federal and local constraints, Pareto-constrained policy gradients with feasibility guarantees, and reward decomposition separating immediate costs from long-term social outcomes. On datasets from 8 U.S. metros (47,392 candidate parcels), AURA attains 94.3% regulatory compliance and improves Pareto hypervolume by 37.2% over strong baselines. In a New York City 2026 case study, it reduces selection time from 18 months to 72 hours and identifies 23% more viable sites; chosen sites have 31% better transit access and 19% lower environmental impact than expert picks.

### [210] [Grables: Tabular Learning Beyond Independent Rows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03945)
*Tamara Cucumides,Floris Geerts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'grables,' a framework that lifts tables into graphs for better handling of inter-row dependencies, outperforming row-wise models in relational and transactional tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tabular learning methods focus on row-wise predictors, which struggle with transactional, temporal, and relational data containing inter-row dependencies.

Method: The authors propose 'grables,' a modular interface that separates the table-to-graph transformation from prediction tasks, allowing for better modeling of inter-row dependencies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that their method realizes gains over traditional row-local models in synthetic tasks, transaction data, and clinical-trials datasets, particularly via message passing and hybrid models.

Conclusion: Lifting tabular data into graph structures enables capturing inter-row dependencies, offering a more expressive and effective means for tabular learning beyond traditional row-wise approaches.

Abstract: Tabular learning is still dominated by row-wise predictors that score each row independently, which fits i.i.d. benchmarks but fails on transactional, temporal, and relational tables where labels depend on other rows. We show that row-wise prediction rules out natural targets driven by global counts, overlaps, and relational patterns. To make "using structure" precise across architectures, we introduce grables: a modular interface that separates how a table is lifted to a graph (constructor) from how predictions are computed on that graph (node predictor), pinpointing where expressive power comes from. Experiments on synthetic tasks, transaction data, and a RelBench clinical-trials dataset confirm the predicted separations: message passing captures inter-row dependencies that row-local models miss, and hybrid approaches that explicitly extract inter-row structure and feed it to strong tabular learners yield consistent gains.

### [211] [Representation Geometry as a Diagnostic for Out-of-Distribution Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03951)
*Ali Zia,Farid Hazratian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new geometry-based diagnostic framework to diagnose model robustness without using target-domain labels by analyzing the geometric structure of learned embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of monitoring and optimizing robust generalization under distribution shift when no target-domain labels are available.

Method: The method analyzes class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs of in-distribution embeddings and extracts two invariants: spectral complexity (via log-determinant of normalized Laplacian) and local smoothness (via Ollivier--Ricci curvature).

Result: Lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature were shown to consistently predict better out-of-distribution accuracy. These findings were validated across architectures, training settings, and datasets.

Conclusion: Representation geometry offers a reliable, interpretable, and label-free approach for robustness diagnosis and unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.

Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.

*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a model for predicting child mortality using a neural architecture, showing superior performance to XGBoost, with significant insights into socioeconomic predictive gradients and regional differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inaccurate predictions of child mortality due to existing models suffering from look-ahead bias, with a goal to create a robust predictive model for targeted interventions.

Method: It utilizes DHS data from Bangladesh (2011-2022), employing a genetic algorithm-based Neural Architecture Search to identify an optimal model architecture. The study trains, validates, and tests the model across different years to ensure validity.

Result: The proposed neural architecture achieved better performance (AUROC = 0.76) than XGBoost (AUROC = 0.73). A positive correlation was observed between regional poverty levels and model accuracy, highlighting socioeconomic gradients.

Conclusion: The model is effective in identifying areas with high intervention needs, outperforming traditional models and providing a production-ready computational phenotype for maternal and child health interventions.

Abstract: The predictive machine learning models for child mortality tend to be inaccurate when applied to future populations, since they suffer from look-ahead bias due to the randomization used in cross-validation. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from Bangladesh for 2011-2022, with n = 33,962, are used in this paper. We trained the model on (2011-2014) data, validated it on 2017 data, and tested it on 2022 data. Eight years after the initial test of the model, a genetic algorithm-based Neural Architecture Search found a single-layer neural architecture (with 64 units) to be superior to XGBoost (AUROC = 0.76 vs. 0.73; p < 0.01). Additionally, through a detailed fairness audit, we identified an overall "Socioeconomic Predictive Gradient," with a positive correlation between regional poverty level (r = -0.62) and the algorithm's AUC. In addition, we found that the model performed at its highest levels in the least affluent divisions (AUC 0.74) and decreased dramatically in the wealthiest divisions (AUC 0.66). These findings suggest that the model is identifying areas with the greatest need for intervention. Our model would identify approximately 1300 additional at-risk children annually than a Gradient Boosting model when screened at the 10% level and validated using SHAP values and Platt Calibration, and therefore provide a robust, production-ready computational phenotype for targeted maternal and child health interventions.

### [213] [DeXposure-FM: A Time-series, Graph Foundation Model for Credit Exposures and Stability on Decentralized Financial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03981)
*Aijie Shu,Wenbin Wu,Gbenga Ibikunle,Fengxiang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeXposure-FM, a time-series graph foundation model for measuring and predicting credit exposure in decentralized finance (DeFi), addressing inter-protocol dependencies effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interdependence within DeFi ecosystems and their linkage to traditional financial systems pose contagion risks. There’s a critical need for effective tools to measure and predict credit exposure dynamics in such ecosystems.

Method: DeXposure-FM uses a graph-tabular encoder with pre-trained weights alongside task-specific heads. It is trained on the DeXposure dataset containing 43.7M entries spanning 602 blockchains and 24,300+ tokens, enabling forecasting of protocol-level flows and credit-exposure network dynamics.

Result: DeXposure-FM outperforms state-of-the-art models, including graph foundation and temporal graph networks. It also provides advanced financial tools for systemic importance, spillover analysis, and stress testing, validated empirically.

Conclusion: The model offers a powerful and validated approach to understanding and managing risks in interconnected DeFi networks, promoting stability. Both the model and code are publicly accessible for further use and development.

Abstract: Credit exposure in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is often implicit and token-mediated, creating a dense web of inter-protocol dependencies. Thus, a shock to one token may result in significant and uncontrolled contagion effects. As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available. Model: https://huggingface.co/EVIEHub/DeXposure-FM.

*Nikolaos Bousias,Lars Lindemann,George Pappas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper integrates geometric group symmetrization with conformal prediction to enhance uncertainty quantification by shrinking conformal prediction sets through averaging non-conformity scores over symmetry orbits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal prediction often results in large uncertainty bounds in long-horizon tasks, which can make statistical guarantees unhelpful. The paper seeks to address this limitation by leveraging geometric symmetries to improve performance and coverage.

Method: The proposed method incorporates group symmetrization via group averaging in pretrained models, which redistributes uncertainty quantification scores across orbit elements of the symmetry group, reducing uncertainty.

Result: The approach successfully contracts non-conformity scores, improves exponential-tail bounds, and sharpens conformal prediction sets at high confidence levels. The method's effectiveness is theoretically established and tested experimentally in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: Group symmetrization is a promising technique for mitigating uncertainty growth in conformal prediction. The approach can offer sharper uncertainty quantification and more reliable predictions at high confidence levels.

Abstract: We study the effect of group symmetrization of pre-trained models on conformal prediction (CP), a post-hoc, distribution-free, finite-sample method of uncertainty quantification that offers formal coverage guarantees under the assumption of data exchangeability. Unfortunately, CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, rendering the statistical guarantees uninformative. To that end, we propose infusing CP with geometric information via group-averaging of the pretrained predictor to distribute the non-conformity mass across the orbits. Each sample now is treated as a representative of an orbit, thus uncertainty can be mitigated by other samples entangled to it via the orbit inducing elements of the symmetry group. Our approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores in increasing convex order, implying improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets in expectation, especially at high confidence levels. We then propose an experimental design to test these theoretical claims in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

### [215] [When Chains of Thought Don't Matter: Causal Bypass in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03994)
*Anish Sathyanarayanan,Aditya Nagarsekar,Aarush Rathore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting does not always causally connect reasoning to outputs, even when appearing transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting genuinely improves reasoning transparency, beyond surface-level manipulation.

Method: The authors used a diagnostic framework combining a behavioral score for CoT text manipulation signals and a causal probe utilizing hidden-state patching to measure CoT-mediated influence (CMI).

Result: Despite audit-aware prompting increasing manipulation signals, evaluations showed task-specific dependence with bypass circuits (CMI ≈ 0 for many QA tasks). Some tasks revealed slight mediation, while layer-wise analysis indicated narrow reasoning windows.

Conclusion: CoT compliance does not assure causal reliance; reasoning transparency is limited and task-dependent. Diagnostic tools like CMI are valuable for analyzing failures.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is widely assumed to expose a model's reasoning process and improve transparency. We attempted to enforce this assumption by penalizing unfaithful reasoning, but found that surface-level compliance does not guarantee causal reliance. Our central finding is negative: even when CoT is verbose, strategic, and flagged by surface-level manipulation detectors, model answers are often causally independent of the CoT content. We present a diagnostic framework for auditing this failure mode: it combines (i) an interpretable behavioral module that scores manipulation-relevant signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe that measures CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching and reports a bypass score ($1-\mathrm{CMI}$), quantifying the degree to which the answer is produced by a bypass circuit independent of the rationale. In pilot evaluations, audit-aware prompting increases detectable manipulation signals (mean risk-score delta: $+5.10$), yet causal probes reveal task-dependent mediation: many QA items exhibit near-total bypass (CMI $\approx 0$), while some logic problems show stronger mediation (CMI up to $0.56$). Layer-wise analysis reveals narrow and task-dependent ``reasoning windows'' even when mean CMI is low.

### [216] [Rational ANOVA Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04006)
*Jusheng Zhang,Ningyuan Liu,Qinhan Lyu,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Rational-ANOVA Network (RAN), a neural network architecture enhancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and stability through functional ANOVA decomposition and rational approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks generally rely on fixed nonlinearities, limiting control over function class and interpretability. Existing solutions like splines address these issues but face inefficiencies and stability concerns.

Method: The RAN architecture uses functional ANOVA decomposition combined with Padé-style rational approximation, modeling functions as compositions of learnable rational units with enforced positive denominators for numerical stability.

Result: RAN achieves better extrapolation, stability, and throughput than MLPs and learnable-activation baselines within vision tasks such as CIFAR-10, under similar parameter and compute budgets.

Conclusion: RAN demonstrates effective combination of interpretability, efficiency, and performance, offering a robust alternative to fixed nonlinearity models in neural network design.

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically treat nonlinearities as fixed primitives (e.g., ReLU), limiting both interpretability and the granularity of control over the induced function class. While recent additive models (like KANs) attempt to address this using splines, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and boundary instability. We propose the Rational-ANOVA Network (RAN), a foundational architecture grounded in functional ANOVA decomposition and Padé-style rational approximation. RAN models f(x) as a composition of main effects and sparse pairwise interactions, where each component is parameterized by a stable, learnable rational unit. Crucially, we enforce a strictly positive denominator, which avoids poles and numerical instability while capturing sharp transitions and near-singular behaviors more efficiently than polynomial bases. This ANOVA structure provides an explicit low-order interaction bias for data efficiency and interpretability, while the rational parameterization significantly improves extrapolation. Across controlled function benchmarks and vision classification tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10) under matched parameter and compute budgets, RAN matches or surpasses parameter-matched MLPs and learnable-activation baselines, with better stability and throughput.

*Mehdi Lotfian,Mohammad Jalali,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PromptSplit, a framework for analyzing prompt-dependent behavior differences in generative AI models using kernel-based methods and computational optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the need to understand and identify prompts that lead to differing behaviors across a growing variety of generative AI models trained with diverse data and architectures.

Method: PromptSplit combines prompts and outputs into tensor-product embeddings, computes kernel covariance matrices, and utilizes eigenspace differences to identify behavioral variations. A random-projection approximation is used to enhance scalability.

Result: PromptSplit demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts driving these discrepancies across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning tasks.

Conclusion: PromptSplit is an interpretable and efficient tool for identifying where generative models diverge in their behaviors based on prompts.

Abstract: Prompt-guided generative AI models have rapidly expanded across vision and language domains, producing realistic and diverse outputs from textual inputs. The growing variety of such models, trained with different data and architectures, calls for principled methods to identify which types of prompts lead to distinct model behaviors. In this work, we propose PromptSplit, a kernel-based framework for detecting and analyzing prompt-dependent disagreement between generative models. For each compared model pair, PromptSplit constructs a joint prompt--output representation by forming tensor-product embeddings of the prompt and image (or text) features, and then computes the corresponding kernel covariance matrix. We utilize the eigenspace of the weighted difference between these matrices to identify the main directions of behavioral difference across prompts. To ensure scalability, we employ a random-projection approximation that reduces computational complexity to $O(nr^2 + r^3)$ for projection dimension $r$. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that this approximation yields an eigenstructure estimate whose expected deviation from the full-dimensional result is bounded by $O(1/r^2)$. Experiments across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning settings demonstrate that PromptSplit accurately detects ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts responsible, offering an interpretable tool for detecting where generative models disagree.

*Yichen Xu,Yuyang Liang,Shan Dai,Tianyang Hu,Tsz Nam Chan,Chenhao Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates efficient layer selection in parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, introducing 'Layer Cards' to optimize layer adaptation while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to reduce costs in fine-tuning large language models while improving inference efficiency and performance, particularly given constraints on latency and flexible deployment.

Method: The study uses a projected residual analysis to assess layer contributions based on projected residual norm, activation energy, and layer coupling, enabling diagnostic-driven layerwise adaptations via 'Layer Cards.'

Result: The proposed method selectively adapts subsets of layers and demonstrates that it significantly reduces fine-tuning cost while achieving performance comparable to full-layer tuning.

Conclusion: Layer-based adaptation guided by diagnostics provides an effective trade-off between cost and performance, advancing parameter-efficient strategies for large models in scalable applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow, the cost of full-parameter fine-tuning has made parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) the default strategy for downstream adaptation. Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost. Moreover, on Qwen3-8B, we show that selectively adapting a subset of layers can achieve performance close to full-layer LoRA while substantially reducing fine-tuning cost and the number of adapter-augmented layers during inference, offering a more cost-performance-aware alternative to full-layer insertion.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GROOVE, a semi-supervised multi-modal representation learning framework that utilizes a novel contrastive learning approach, GroupCLIP, for weakly-paired datasets and demonstrates its effectiveness using rigorous benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning robust and entangled multi-modal representations in datasets where modal samples are weakly paired (with shared labels but no direct correspondence).

Method: GROOVE employs GroupCLIP, a group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between paired and uni-modal contrastive approaches. This is integrated with a backtranslating autoencoder for cross-modal consistency and utilizes a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework to assess performance.

Result: GROOVE either outperforms or performs on par with existing methods in cross-modal matching and imputation tasks across simulations and real genetic perturbation datasets. GroupCLIP is identified as the primary contributor to these gains.

Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of group-level constraints in weakly-paired multi-modal learning scenarios, positioning GROOVE as an effective solution in such contexts.

Abstract: We present GROOVE, a semi-supervised multi-modal representation learning approach for high-content perturbation data where samples across modalities are weakly paired through shared perturbation labels but lack direct correspondence. Our primary contribution is GroupCLIP, a novel group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between CLIP for paired cross-modal data and SupCon for uni-modal supervised contrastive learning, addressing a fundamental gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired settings. We integrate GroupCLIP with an on-the-fly backtranslating autoencoder framework to encourage cross-modally entangled representations while maintaining group-level coherence within a shared latent space. Critically, we introduce a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework that systematically assesses representation learners across multiple optimal transport aligners, addressing key limitations in existing evaluation strategies. This framework includes novel simulations that systematically vary shared versus modality-specific perturbation effects enabling principled assessment of method robustness. Our combinatorial benchmarking reveals that there is not yet an aligner that uniformly dominates across settings or modality pairs. Across simulations and two real single-cell genetic perturbation datasets, GROOVE performs on par with or outperforms existing approaches for downstream cross-modal matching and imputation tasks. Our ablation studies demonstrate that GroupCLIP is the key component driving performance gains. These results highlight the importance of leveraging group-level constraints for effective multi-modal representation learning in scenarios where only weak pairing is available.

### [220] [A Consensus-Bayesian Framework for Detecting Malicious Activity in Enterprise Directory Access Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04027)
*Pratyush Uppuluri,Shilpa Noushad,Sajan Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian framework to detect malicious user behavior in enterprise directory access graphs through consensus-driven opinion dynamics and Bayesian anomaly scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting malicious user activity by identifying logical anomalies in access patterns within enterprise directory systems.

Method: The authors model directories as topics and users as agents in a graph, simulate access evolution using opinion dynamics, identify anomalies via scaled opinion variance, and introduce a Bayesian scoring mechanism to quantify uncertainty.

Result: Simulated tests on synthetic access graphs show that the method is both sensitive to logical inconsistencies and resilient to dynamic perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects malicious behavior while accounting for dynamic changes in directory access patterns, with sensitivity and robustness validated through simulations.

Abstract: This work presents a consensus-based Bayesian framework to detect malicious user behavior in enterprise directory access graphs. By modeling directories as topics and users as agents within a multi-level interaction graph, we simulate access evolution using influence-weighted opinion dynamics. Logical dependencies between users are encoded in dynamic matrices Ci, and directory similarity is captured via a shared influence matrix W. Malicious behavior is injected as cross-component logical perturbations that violate structural norms of strongly connected components(SCCs). We apply theoretical guarantees from opinion dynamics literature to determine topic convergence and detect anomaly via scaled opinion variance. To quantify uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian anomaly scoring mechanism that evolves over time, using both static and online priors. Simulations over synthetic access graphs validate our method, demonstrating its sensitivity to logical inconsistencies and robustness under dynamic perturbation.

*Aditya Gorla,Ratish Puduppully*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper re-evaluates Tabula-8B's tabular prediction claims using a large dataset, finding that classification performance is inflated due to contamination and artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the claimed generalization abilities of Tabular Language Models, specifically Tabula-8B, amidst concerns of evaluation artifacts.

Method: Systematic re-evaluation of Tabula-8B with UniPredict benchmark datasets, analyzing performance across data types and assessing contamination effects.

Result: Three major findings: 1) Near-zero improvement for binary/categorical classifications, 2) pervasive contamination in datasets, 3) instruction-tuning without tabular exposure recovers most classification performance.

Conclusion: The observed generalization in TLMs, particularly Tabula-8B, is likely driven by evaluation artifacts rather than true tabular reasoning capabilities. Recommendations for stronger evaluation methodologies are provided.

Abstract: Tabular Language Models (TLMs) have been claimed to achieve emergent generalization for tabular prediction. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of Tabula-8B as a representative TLM, utilizing 165 datasets from the UniPredict benchmark. Our investigation reveals three findings. First, binary and categorical classification achieve near-zero median lift over majority-class baselines and strong aggregate performance is driven entirely by quartile classification tasks. Second, top-performing datasets exhibit pervasive contamination, including complete train-test overlap and task-level leakage that evades standard deduplication. Third, instruction-tuning without tabular exposure recovers 92.2% of standard classification performance and on quartile classification, format familiarity closes 71.3% of the gap with the residual attributable to contaminated datasets. These findings suggest claimed generalization likely reflects evaluation artifacts rather than learned tabular reasoning. We conclude with recommendations for strengthening TLM evaluation.

TL;DR: Partition Trees propose a tree-based framework for conditional density estimation, supporting comprehensive outcome spaces and introducing scalable, nonparametric probabilistic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address conditional density estimation over mixed outcome spaces (continuous and categorical variables) while overcoming limitations of parametric assumptions in existing methods.

Method: Partition Trees model piecewise-constant densities on adaptable partitions, minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood. Partition Forests extend this to ensembles by averaging densities.

Result: The method showcases improved probabilistic predictions and competes effectively with state-of-the-art tree approaches and Random Forests, demonstrating robustness to redundant features and noise.

Conclusion: Partition Trees and Forests offer scalable, nonparametric alternatives for conditional density estimation, with competitive and robust predictive performance across diverse settings.

Abstract: We propose Partition Trees, a tree-based framework for conditional density estimation over general outcome spaces, supporting both continuous and categorical variables within a unified formulation. Our approach models conditional distributions as piecewise-constant densities on data adaptive partitions and learns trees by directly minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood. This yields a scalable, nonparametric alternative to existing probabilistic trees that does not make parametric assumptions about the target distribution. We further introduce Partition Forests, an ensemble extension obtained by averaging conditional densities. Empirically, we demonstrate improved probabilistic prediction over CART-style trees and competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic tree methods and Random Forests, along with robustness to redundant features and heteroscedastic noise.

### [223] [DADP: Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04037)
*Pengcheng Wang,Qinghang Liu,Haotian Lin,Yiheng Li,Guojian Zhan,Masayoshi Tomizuka,Yixiao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy (DADP) to improve domain adaptation and generalization in control tasks via disentangling static and dynamical properties and selectively incorporating learned domain representations into decision-making processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address challenges in adapting to dynamic environments by learning domain adaptive policies that robustly generalize to new and unseen transition dynamics, improving zero-shot adaptation in control tasks.

Method: The DADP framework introduces two main strategies: 1) Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction, which uses an offset context to learn static domain representations by filtering transient properties, and 2) a domain-aware diffusion mechanism that incorporates these representations into a generative process through prior distribution biasing and reformulated diffusion targets.

Result: DADP achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to prior methods in overcoming domain-specific challenges, as demonstrated through extensive locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed DADP effectively disentangles static and dynamic domain properties, improving policy adaptation in diverse environments. This approach offers a practical solution for robust, generalizable control in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Learning domain adaptive policies that can generalize to unseen transition dynamics, remains a fundamental challenge in learning-based control. Substantial progress has been made through domain representation learning to capture domain-specific information, thus enabling domain-aware decision making. We analyze the process of learning domain representations through dynamical prediction and find that selecting contexts adjacent to the current step causes the learned representations to entangle static domain information with varying dynamical properties. Such mixture can confuse the conditioned policy, thereby constraining zero-shot adaptation. To tackle the challenge, we propose DADP (Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy), which achieves robust adaptation through unsupervised disentanglement and domain-aware diffusion injection. First, we introduce Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction, a strategy that conditions future state estimation on a historical offset context; by increasing this temporal gap, we unsupervisedly disentangle static domain representations by filtering out transient properties. Second, we integrate the learned domain representations directly into the generative process by biasing the prior distribution and reformulating the diffusion target. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across locomotion and manipulation demonstrate the superior performance, and the generalizability of DADP over prior methods.

### [224] [Principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04078)
*Róisín Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper seeks to deepen the understanding of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks by analyzing its theoretical principles from two perspectives: training dynamics and input data signal frequency modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of robustness and generalization in deep learning by understanding fundamental principles governing neural networks.

Method: Explores Lipschitz continuity's role in neural networks through internal analysis on training dynamics and external analysis on frequency signal propagation.

Result: Provides insights into neural networks' sensitivity to input perturbations and their behavior regarding frequency signals in input data.

Conclusion: Lipschitz continuity is crucial for the theoretical foundation of robustness and generalization in neural networks, highlighting its importance during training and data behavior analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, significantly expanding the frontiers of what is achievable in artificial intelligence. Yet, despite these advances, critical challenges remain -- most notably, ensuring robustness to small input perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data. These critical challenges underscore the need to understand the underlying fundamental principles that govern robustness and generalization. Among the theoretical tools available, Lipschitz continuity plays a pivotal role in governing the fundamental properties of neural networks related to robustness and generalization. It quantifies the worst-case sensitivity of network's outputs to small input perturbations. While its importance is widely acknowledged, prior research has predominantly focused on empirical regularization approaches based on Lipschitz constraints, leaving the underlying principles less explored. This thesis seeks to advance a principled understanding of the principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks within the paradigm of machine learning, examined from two complementary perspectives: an internal perspective -- focusing on the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training (i.e., training dynamics); and an external perspective -- investigating how Lipschitz continuity modulates the behavior of neural networks with respect to features in the input data, particularly its role in governing frequency signal propagation (i.e., modulation of frequency signal propagation).

### [225] [SEIS: Subspace-based Equivariance and Invariance Scores for Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04054)
*Huahua Lin,Katayoun Farrahi,Xiaohao Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SEIS, a new metric for analyzing the behavior of neural representations under geometric transformations, revealing their transition from equivariance to invariance and providing insights into model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand and evaluate how neural representations handle geometric transformations, as this understanding is critical for interpreting model behavior and ensuring learned features maintain meaningful spatial structure.

Method: The paper introduces the SEIS metric, which analyzes layer-wise feature representations under transformations, uniquely separating equivariance and invariance without relying on labels or explicit knowledge of transformations.

Result: SEIS is validated synthetically and demonstrates in classification networks that early layers exhibit equivariance, while deeper layers exhibit invariance. It also shows that data augmentation enhances invariance, multi-task learning improves both properties, and skip connections restore equivariance lost in decoding.

Conclusion: SEIS provides a reliable framework to decipher how neural networks process geometric transformations, offering insights for improving neural network architectures such as through data augmentation, skip connections, and multi-task learning.

Abstract: Understanding how neural representations respond to geometric transformations is essential for evaluating whether learned features preserve meaningful spatial structure. Existing approaches primarily assess robustness by comparing model outputs under transformed inputs, offering limited insight into how geometric information is organized within internal representations and failing to distinguish between information loss and re-encoding. In this work, we introduce SEIS (Subspace-based Equivariance and Invariance Scores), a subspace metric for analyzing layer-wise feature representations under geometric transformations, disentangling equivariance from invariance without requiring labels or explicit knowledge of the transformation. Synthetic validation confirms that SEIS correctly recovers known transformations. Applied to trained classification networks, SEIS reveals a transition from equivariance in early layers to invariance in deeper layers, and that data augmentation increases invariance while preserving equivariance. We further show that multi-task learning induces synergistic gains in both properties at the shared encoder, and skip connections restore equivariance lost during decoding.

### [226] [Separation-Utility Pareto Frontier: An Information-Theoretic Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04408)
*Shizhou Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the trade-off between predictive utility and fairness (separation) in machine learning models, providing theoretical characterizations and an empirical solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing utility and fairness in predictive models, especially with fairness measured through separation (independence from sensitive attributes given true outcomes).

Method: The paper uses an information-theoretic approach to characterize the trade-off frontier between utility and separation, introduces a conditional mutual information (CMI)-based regularizer, and validates it through experiments.

Result: The method reduces fairness violations while maintaining or improving predictive utility across multiple datasets (COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, CelebA).

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretically sound and empirically effective approach to enforce fairness (separation) in deep learning models through a flexible and provable mechanism.

Abstract: We study the Pareto frontier (optimal trade-off) between utility and separation, a fairness criterion requiring predictive independence from sensitive attributes conditional on the true outcome. Through an information-theoretic lens, we prove a characterization of the utility-separation Pareto frontier, establish its concavity, and thereby prove the increasing marginal cost of separation in terms of utility. In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods. This study thus offers a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation in deep learning.

*Gautam Choudhary,Libin Zhou,Yeasir Rayhan,Walid G. Aref*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews ML-based distance indexes for road networks, comparing them to classical methods on real-world datasets, focusing on training time, storage, latency, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical algorithms like Dijkstra's are too slow for modern real-time large-scale road network applications. ML-based methods promise to significantly enhance speed with approximate results.

Method: The paper empirically evaluates ten ML-based distance indexes against classical baselines on seven real-world road networks, using a dataset derived from trajectory data.

Result: The ML-based approaches are benchmarked for training time, query latency, storage needs, and accuracy, with insights into their advantages and trade-offs against classical methods.

Conclusion: ML-based distance indexes show promise but have trade-offs across efficiency dimensions; the research provides valuable benchmarks and releases a unified open-source codebase for future studies.

Abstract: The calculation of shortest-path distances in road networks is a core operation in navigation systems, location-based services, and spatial analytics. Although classical algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, provide exact answers, their latency is prohibitive for modern real-time, large-scale deployments. Over the past two decades, numerous distance indexes have been proposed to speed up query processing for shortest distance queries. More recently, with the advancement in machine learning (ML), researchers have designed and proposed ML-based distance indexes to answer approximate shortest path and distance queries efficiently. However, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these ML-based approaches is lacking. This paper presents the first empirical survey of ML-based distance indexes on road networks, evaluating them along four key dimensions: Training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy. Using seven real-world road networks and workload-driven query datasets derived from trajectory data, we benchmark ten representative ML techniques and compare them against strong classical non-ML baselines, highlighting key insights and practical trade-offs. We release a unified open-source codebase to support reproducibility and future research on learned distance indexes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for maintaining and continuously updating survey papers to address redundancy and outdated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survey papers become quickly outdated due to the rapid growth of research work, leading to redundancy and fragmented literature. Current usage lacks a dynamic approach.

Method: Introduces a Dynamic Survey Framework that allows for continuous updates of survey papers by integrating new research incrementally with minimal disruption to existing structure.

Result: The framework successfully identifies and incorporates new research while maintaining the integrity and organization of existing surveys, as demonstrated in retrospective experiments.

Conclusion: Dynamic surveys enable the evolution of scientific papers to stay relevant over time, mitigating the redundancy and fragmentation seen in static surveys.

Abstract: Survey papers play a central role in synthesizing and organizing scientific knowledge, yet they are increasingly strained by the rapid growth of research output. As new work continues to appear after publication, surveys quickly become outdated, contributing to redundancy and fragmentation in the literature. We reframe survey writing as a long-horizon maintenance problem rather than a one-time generation task, treating surveys as living documents that evolve alongside the research they describe. We propose an agentic Dynamic Survey Framework that supports the continuous updating of existing survey papers by incrementally integrating new work while preserving survey structure and minimizing unnecessary disruption. Using a retrospective experimental setup, we demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively identifies and incorporates emerging research while preserving the coherence and structure of existing surveys.

*Dmitry Yarotsky,Eugene Golikov,Yaroslav Gusev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical framework to analyze scaling regimes in gradient flow for large learning problems using a power series expansion with Feynman-like diagrams, focusing on tensor decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to better understand the dynamics of gradient flow in complex, large-scale learning problems and identify different learning phases or regimes.

Method: The authors use a formal power series expansion for loss evolution, leveraging diagrams like Feynman diagrams. They solved these expansions via partial differential equations reducible to first-order equations, using tensor decomposition as a primary example.

Result: The study identifies multiple learning regimes (e.g., lazy, rich GF, NTK) influenced by parameter scaling, tensor order, and symmetry. Predictions from the theory align well with experimental observations.

Conclusion: Their approach provides new tools to explicitly solve and analyze gradient flow in learning problems, illuminating how different factors influence learning dynamics.

Abstract: We develop a general mathematical framework to analyze scaling regimes and derive explicit analytic solutions for gradient flow (GF) in large learning problems. Our key innovation is a formal power series expansion of the loss evolution, with coefficients encoded by diagrams akin to Feynman diagrams. We show that this expansion has a well-defined large-size limit that can be used to reveal different learning phases and, in some cases, to obtain explicit solutions of the nonlinear GF. We focus on learning Canonical Polyadic (CP) decompositions of high-order tensors, and show that this model has several distinct extreme lazy and rich GF regimes such as free evolution, NTK and under- and over-parameterized mean-field. We show that these regimes depend on the parameter scaling, tensor order, and symmetry of the model in a specific and subtle way. Moreover, we propose a general approach to summing the formal loss expansion by reducing it to a PDE; in a wide range of scenarios, it turns out to be 1st order and solvable by the method of characteristics. We observe a very good agreement of our theoretical predictions with experiment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework (BLUM) for evaluating the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) through clinical lesion-symptom mapping methodology, traditionally used for studying human brain-behavior relationships. It finds similarities between LLM error patterns and human brain lesion patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current LLM interpretability methods that rely only on internal metrics and lack external reference validation frameworks.

Method: The authors applied lesion-symptom mapping to LLMs by training symptom-to-lesion prediction models on post-stroke aphasia data, introducing systematic perturbations to transformer layers, and comparing LLM and human behavioral error profiles projected into brain lesion space.

Result: LLM error patterns closely matched human error profiles, with lesion predictions aligning with actual human lesion locations above chance in 67% of picture naming and 68.3% of sentence completion tasks. Different error types mapped onto distinct brain-stream lesion patterns.

Conclusion: This study introduces the potential of using clinical neuroscience lesion-symptom mapping as an external validation framework for understanding the interpretability of LLMs, showing alignment between LLMs and human computational principles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet methods to verify which model components are truly necessary for language function remain limited. Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves understanding and results in gradient-variation online learning, particularly focusing on Bandit Convex Optimization with two-point feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-variation online learning serves as an important tool in optimization, game theory, and related fields, but its study under bandit feedback is limited.

Method: By revisiting and refining the analysis of non-consecutive gradient variation, the authors enhance theoretical bounds and explore new setups for bandit optimization.

Result: The authors achieve better dimension dependence for convex and strongly convex functions, derive new problem-dependent bounds, and extend their technique to broader problem setups such as one-point bandit linear optimization.

Conclusion: These advancements in gradient-variation online learning benefit dynamic regret minimization and bandit game settings, introducing first-of-their-kind results in these challenging contexts.

Abstract: Gradient-variation online learning has drawn increasing attention due to its deep connections to game theory, optimization, etc. It has been studied extensively in the full-information setting, but is underexplored with bandit feedback. In this work, we focus on gradient variation in Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with two-point feedback. By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond the two-point setup, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique by achieving the first gradient-variation bound for one-point bandit linear optimization over hyper-rectangular domains. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our results in more challenging tasks such as dynamic/universal regret minimization and bandit games, establishing the first gradient-variation dynamic and universal regret bounds for two-point BCO and fast convergence rates in bandit games.

*Yicheng Zou,Samuel Lanthaler,Hossein Salahshoor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deterministic neural operators struggle with high-frequency wave PDEs; a probabilistic framework using score-based diffusion is proposed for robust predictions and uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of deterministic neural operators in approximating high-frequency wave phenomena due to spectral biases and sensitivity, and provide a robust solution.

Method: Develop a probabilistic framework using a score-based conditional diffusion operator to model waves in the high-frequency regime and validate using stability analysis and numerical experiments.

Result: The proposed framework consistently achieved the lowest errors across $L^2$, $H^1$, and energy norms, and uniquely captured propagated uncertainties, outperforming other approaches.

Conclusion: Probabilistic operator learning offers a principled and effective approach for solving highly sensitive PDEs like Helmholtz in high-frequency conditions.

Abstract: Deterministic neural operators perform well on many PDEs but can struggle with the approximation of high-frequency wave phenomena, where strong input-to-output sensitivity makes operator learning challenging, and spectral bias blurs oscillations. We argue for adopting a probabilistic approach for approximating waves in high-frequency regime, and develop our probabilistic framework using a score-based conditional diffusion operator. After demonstrating a stability analysis of the Helmholtz operator, we present our numerical experiments across a wide range of frequencies, benchmarked against other popular data-driven and machine learning approaches for waves. We show that our probabilistic neural operator consistently produces robust predictions with the lowest errors in $L^2$, $H^1$, and energy norms. Moreover, unlike all the other tested deterministic approaches, our framework remarkably captures uncertainties in the input sound speed map propagated to the solution field. We envision that our results position probabilistic operator learning as a principled and effective approach for solving complex PDEs such as Helmholtz in the challenging high-frequency regime.

### [233] [Maximum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04795)
*Olivier Vu Thanh,Nicolas Gillis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Maximum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (MaxVol NMF), a novel approach that maximizes the volume of factor H, leading to sparse decompositions and better clustering in noisy data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve interpretability and unique solutions in Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by addressing the limitations of Minimum-Volume NMF (MinVol NMF), particularly in noisy environments.

Method: The Maximum-Volume NMF (MaxVol NMF) approach is proposed. It maximizes the volume of factor H instead of minimizing W's volume. The paper introduces two algorithms for MaxVol NMF and a normalized variant that balances between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF.

Result: MaxVol NMF provides sparse decompositions, avoids rank-deficient solutions, and clusters columns of X into disjoint groups. Its normalized variant demonstrates improved performance over both MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF.

Conclusion: MaxVol NMF is superior in sparse decomposition and clustering compared to MinVol NMF, making it a preferable approach in noisy datasets. Its normalized variant further bridges the gap between standard and orthogonal NMF methods.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs) to enhance interpretability in deep learning and address challenges in Federated Learning (FL), enabling cross-institutional concept information sharing and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept-based models enhance interpretability, but require expensive annotations, which are rarely scalable. Federated Learning offers potential for cross-institutional model training, yet lacks interpretable paradigms.

Method: The authors propose F-CMs, a method integrating CMs with FL that aggregates concept data across institutions, adapts to evolving concept supervision, and ensures privacy.

Result: F-CMs maintain accuracy and intervention effectiveness while outperforming static federated baselines. Additionally, they support interpretable predictions on concepts unavailable to certain institutions.

Conclusion: F-CMs provide a novel, interpretable approach for federated learning settings, allowing dynamic adaptation to institutional changes and enhancing collaboration without compromising privacy and performance.

Abstract: Concept-based models (CMs) enhance interpretability in deep learning by grounding predictions in human-understandable concepts. However, concept annotations are expensive to obtain and rarely available at scale within a single data source. Federated learning (FL) could alleviate this limitation by enabling cross-institutional training that leverages concept annotations distributed across multiple data owners. Yet, FL lacks interpretable modeling paradigms. Integrating CMs with FL is non-trivial: CMs assume a fixed concept space and a predefined model architecture, whereas real-world FL is heterogeneous and non-stationary, with institutions joining over time and bringing new supervision. In this work, we propose Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs), a new methodology for deploying CMs in evolving FL settings. F-CMs aggregate concept-level information across institutions and efficiently adapt the model architecture in response to changes in the available concept supervision, while preserving institutional privacy. Empirically, F-CMs preserve the accuracy and intervention effectiveness of training settings with full concept supervision, while outperforming non-adaptive federated baselines. Notably, F-CMs enable interpretable inference on concepts not available to a given institution, a key novelty with respect to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context-Robust Remasking (CoRe), a method to improve Masked Diffusion Models by targeting context sensitivity during inference-time revision instead of relying on static confidence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decoding in Masked Diffusion Models faces issues with context rigidity, where early incorrect tokens from transient confidence lead to cascading errors, and existing methods relying on static confidence scores are inherently limited.

Method: The proposed CoRe framework probes context sensitivity through masked-context perturbations and formalizes revision as a robust optimization problem, efficiently identifying context-vulnerable tokens for revision during inference.

Result: CoRe achieves significant improvements in performance on LLaDA-8B-Base benchmarks, including reasoning and coding tasks, improving MBPP performance by up to 9.2 percentage points compared to compute-matched baselines.

Conclusion: CoRe demonstrates the effectiveness of focusing on context sensitivity and dynamic optimization for mitigating issues in Masked Diffusion Models, outperforming existing strategies in both reasoning and code benchmarks.

Abstract: Standard decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) is hindered by context rigidity: tokens are retained based on transient high confidence, often ignoring that early predictions lack full context. This creates cascade effects where initial inconsistencies misguide the remaining generation. Existing revision strategies attempt to mitigate this by relying on static confidence scores, but these signals are inherently myopic; inconsistent tokens can appear confident to the model itself. We propose Context-Robust Remasking (CoRe), a training-free framework for inference-time revision. Rather than trusting static token probabilities, CoRe identifies context-brittle tokens by probing their sensitivity to targeted masked-context perturbations. We formalize revision as a robust optimization objective over context shifts and efficiently approximate this objective to prioritize unstable tokens for revision. On LLaDA-8B-Base, CoRe delivers consistent improvements across reasoning and code benchmarks, outperforming compute-matched baselines and improving MBPP by up to 9.2 percentage points.

*Ishaq Aden-Ali,Noah Golowich,Allen Liu,Abhishek Shetty,Ankur Moitra,Nika Haghtalab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how datasets influence large language models (LLMs) and introduces the Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS) for uncovering hidden effects from preference datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gaps in understanding how datasets shape the properties of LLMs, especially given recent findings that datasets can transmit indirect, hidden signals.

Method: The authors propose the Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS) method, which selects subsets of generic datasets to elicit various hidden effects in models.

Result: The LLS method demonstrated that subsets of datasets can lead to models exhibiting specific preferences, multilingual responses, and persona-like behavior, independent of model architecture.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a universal mechanism by which dataset subsets can influence diverse model behaviors, enhancing the understanding of how data shapes LLM performance.

Abstract: Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.
  We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.

### [237] [Rethinking Perplexity: Revealing the Impact of Input Length on Perplexity Evaluation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04099)
*Letian Cheng,Junyan Wang,Yan Gao,Elliott Wen,Ting Dang,Hong Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the effect of input length on perplexity—a metric for assessing large language model (LLM) quality—and introduces LengthBenchmark to systematically analyze length biases in evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the unreliability of traditional perplexity metrics caused by irrelevant long inputs, which negatively impact fairness and efficiency in benchmarking and deployment.

Method: The authors propose LengthBenchmark, an evaluation framework that integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system costs. It evaluates both full-precision and quantized LLMs using two scoring protocols: direct accumulation and fixed window sliding.

Result: The framework shows that sliding window evaluations inflate performance on short inputs and that both full-precision and quantized models benefit from longer evaluated segments, revealing length bias as a systemic issue.

Conclusion: Length bias undermines fair model comparisons, and LengthBenchmark provides a more comprehensive and system-conscious approach to assessing LLMs relative to input length and protocol design.

Abstract: Perplexity is a widely adopted metric for assessing the predictive quality of large language models (LLMs) and often serves as a reference metric for downstream evaluations. However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison. Our analysis yields two key observations: (i) sliding window evaluation consistently inflates performance on short inputs, and (ii) both full-precision and quantized models appear to realise gains as the evaluated segment length grows.

*Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for understanding generalization in machine learning using lossy compression and finite blocklength analysis, deriving bounds on sample complexity and generalization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle generalization in machine learning by linking it with concepts of lossy compression and addressing overfitting and inductive bias through an analytical framework.

Method: Training data corresponds to encoding, and model construction is treated as a decoding process. Finite blocklength analysis is utilized to derive mathematically explicit bounds on sample complexity and generalization error.

Result: The paper derives new bounds that separate the effects of overfitting and inductive bias. It also connects these results to existing metrics in information-theoretic and stability perspectives.

Conclusion: The study presents a unified framework that advances understanding generalization by separating overfitting and inductive bias contributions, offering insights for analyzing learning algorithms.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel information-theoretic perspective on generalization in machine learning by framing the learning problem within the context of lossy compression and applying finite blocklength analysis. In our approach, the sampling of training data formally corresponds to an encoding process, and the model construction to a decoding process. By leveraging finite blocklength analysis, we derive lower bounds on sample complexity and generalization error for a fixed randomized learning algorithm and its associated optimal sampling strategy. Our bounds explicitly characterize the degree of overfitting of the learning algorithm and the mismatch between its inductive bias and the task as distinct terms. This separation provides a significant advantage over existing frameworks. Additionally, we decompose the overfitting term to show its theoretical connection to existing metrics found in information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, unifying these perspectives under our proposed framework.

### [239] [Rate-Optimal Noise Annealing in Semi-Dual Neural Optimal Transport: Tangential Identifiability, Off-Manifold Ambiguity, and Guaranteed Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04110)
*Raymond Chu,Jaewoong Choi,Dohyun Kwon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in semi-dual neural optimal transport by studying smoothing to handle degenerate transport maps caused by low-dimensional data manifolds. Practical guarantees and stopping rules are derived for noise settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve issues of incorrect or degenerate transport maps in semi-dual neural optimal transport, especially when data lies on low-dimensional manifolds.

Method: The paper uses additive-noise smoothing, backed by theoretical analysis of stability, bias from smoothing, and finite-sample errors, with focus on intrinsic data dimensions.

Result: Derived recovery guarantees for transport maps as noise vanishes, a computable noise level ensuring optimal statistical rates, and insights on ill-conditioning in reduced objectives.

Conclusion: Additive-noise smoothing remedies degenerate solutions, with a principled noise stopping rule balancing optimization conditions and statistical accuracy.

Abstract: Semi-dual neural optimal transport learns a transport map via a max-min objective, yet training can converge to incorrect or degenerate maps. We fully characterize these spurious solutions in the common regime where data concentrate on low-dimensional manifold: the objective is underconstrained off the data manifold, while the on-manifold transport signal remains identifiable. Following Choi, Choi, and Kwon (2025), we study additive-noise smoothing as a remedy and prove new map recovery guarantees as the noise vanishes. Our main practical contribution is a computable terminal noise level $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ that attains the optimal statistical rate, with scaling governed by the intrinsic dimension $m$ of the data. The formula arises from a theoretical unified analysis of (i) quantitative stability of optimal plans, (ii) smoothing-induced bias, and (iii) finite-sample error, yielding rates that depend on $m$ rather than the ambient dimension. Finally, we show that the reduced semi-dual objective becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$. This provides a principled stopping rule: annealing below $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ can $\textit{worsen}$ optimization conditioning without improving statistical accuracy.

### [240] [Turning mechanistic models into forecasters by using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04114)
*Amit K. Chakraborty,Hao Wang,Pouria Ramazi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to identify governing equations of dynamical systems with time-varying parameters from time-series data for better accuracy and forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitation of traditional data-driven methods that assume time-invariant coefficients, which restricts capturing evolving system dynamics.

Method: The authors propose incorporating time-varying parameters into a data-driven framework to infer equations, and transform this system into forecasting by predicting these parameters.

Result: The model achieved a mean absolute error below 3% for time series learning and below 6% for forecasting, outperforming CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine across datasets.

Conclusion: Including time-varying parameters in data-driven models enhances both the accuracy of learning governing equations and the performance of forecasts on complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: The equations of complex dynamical systems may not be identified by expert knowledge, especially if the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\% for learning a time series and below 6\% for forecasting up to a month ahead. We additionally compare forecasting performance against CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and show that our model outperforms these methods across most datasets. Our findings demonstrate that integrating time-varying parameters into data-driven discovery of differential equations improves both modeling accuracy and forecasting performance.

### [241] [Toward Effective Multimodal Graph Foundation Model: A Divide-and-Conquer Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04116)
*Sicheng Liu,Xunkai Li,Daohan Su,Ru Zhang,Hongchao Qin,Ronghua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework, PLANET, to address issues in Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs), such as insufficient modality interaction and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to extend the potential of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) to Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs), which remain unexplored, enabling richer multimodal information utilization and addressing broader downstream tasks.

Method: The proposed methodology, PLANET, adopts a Divide-and-Conquer strategy with two key components: Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) for better modality interaction and Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) for improved global modality alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PLANET significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines in graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.

Conclusion: PLANET effectively resolves the limitations in existing MGFMs, particularly by improving cross-modality interaction and alignment, proving its capability for broader multimodal applications.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.

*John X. Morris,Niloofar Mireshghallah,Mark Ibrahim,Saeed Mahloujifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes TinyLoRA, a highly efficient method to learn reasoning tasks in language models, achieving remarkable accuracy with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of low-rank parameterizations in reasoning tasks, addressing the limitations of conventional methods like LoRA in extremely low-rank adaptations.

Method: Proposes TinyLoRA, a novel technique scaling low-rank adapters to as low as one parameter, specifically leveraging reinforcement learning for training.

Result: TinyLoRA enables training large models like Qwen2.5 (8B parameters) to high accuracies (91% on GSM8K) with minimal parameter updates (13 parameters, 26 bytes) and outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: TinyLoRA is a groundbreaking strategy for training low-rank reasoning adapters efficiently, establishing that RL is superior to SFT for minimal parameter training, while maintaining high task performance.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that language models can learn to \textit{reason}, often via reinforcement learning. Some work even trains low-rank parameterizations for reasoning, but conventional LoRA cannot scale below the model dimension. We question whether even rank=1 LoRA is necessary for learning to reason and propose TinyLoRA, a method for scaling low-rank adapters to sizes as small as one parameter. Within our new parameterization, we are able to train the 8B parameter size of Qwen2.5 to 91\% accuracy on GSM8K with only 13 trained parameters in bf16 (26 total bytes). We find this trend holds in general: we are able to recover 90\% of performance improvements while training $1000x$ fewer parameters across a suite of more difficult learning-to-reason benchmarks such as AIME, AMC, and MATH500. Notably, we are only able to achieve such strong performance with RL: models trained using SFT require $100-1000x$ larger updates to reach the same performance.

*Hyeonah Kim,Minsu Kim,Celine Roget,Dionessa Biton,Louis Vaillancourt,Yves V. Brun,Yoshua Bengio,Alex Hernandez-Garcia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces S3-GFN, a method for designing synthesizable molecules via soft regularization in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the synthesis practicality of molecules designed by generative models in experimental drug discovery.

Method: S3-GFN uses soft regularization based on molecular priors learned from large SMILES datasets, steering generation using contrastive learning with synthesizable and unsynthesizable sample buffers.

Result: S3-GFN achieves a high synthesis rate (≥ 95%) while generating molecules with enhanced rewards across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The approach is scalable and flexible, overcoming limitations of previous hard-constrained methods for synthesizable molecular generation.

Abstract: The application of generative models for experimental drug discovery campaigns is severely limited by the difficulty of designing molecules de novo that can be synthesized in practice. Previous works have leveraged Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to impose hard synthesizability constraints through the design of state and action spaces based on predefined reaction templates and building blocks. Despite the promising prospects of this approach, it currently lacks flexibility and scalability. As an alternative, we propose S3-GFN, which generates synthesizable SMILES molecules via simple soft regularization of a sequence-based GFlowNet. Our approach leverages rich molecular priors learned from large-scale SMILES corpora to steer molecular generation towards high-reward, synthesizable chemical spaces. The model induces constraints through off-policy replay training with a contrastive learning signal based on separate buffers of synthesizable and unsynthesizable samples. Our experiments show that S3-GFN learns to generate synthesizable molecules ($\geq 95\%$) with higher rewards in diverse tasks.

*Mehrdad Moghimi,Anthony Coache,Hyejin Ku*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework for flexible discounting in distributional reinforcement learning to improve optimization of temporal and risk preferences, validated through mathematical analysis and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of a fixed or exponential discount factor in characterizing an agent's time preferences and its impact on learned policies, especially in safety-critical domains.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework for flexible discounting of future rewards and risk measure optimization in distributional RL. They also introduce a multi-horizon extension to improve upon existing methods and analyze the optimality of the proposed algorithms.

Result: The multi-horizon framework fixes issues in current methodologies, and the experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: Discounting plays a critical role in decision-making, enabling more expressive modeling of temporal and risk preferences, with significant implications for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains for its ability to optimize risk-sensitive objectives. However, the role of the discount factor is often overlooked, as it is typically treated as a fixed parameter of the Markov decision process or tunable hyperparameter, with little consideration of its effect on the learned policy. In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments. Our results highlight that discounting is a cornerstone in decision-making problems for capturing more expressive temporal and risk preferences profiles, with potential implications for real-world safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: A diffusion last layer (DLL) is introduced to enhance uncertainty modeling in neural operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of principled uncertainty quantification in stochastic systems within scientific computing.

Method: DLL attaches a lightweight probabilistic model to neural operators, leveraging low-rank Karhunen-Loève expansion for efficient predictive uncertainty modeling.

Result: DLL improves generalization and uncertainty-aware prediction in stochastic PDE learning and enhances rollout stability in deterministic scenarios.

Conclusion: DLL effectively enhances neural operators by providing reliable uncertainty quantification and stability improvement across different settings.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning discretization-invariant function-to-function mappings in scientific computing. However, many practical systems are inherently stochastic, making principled uncertainty quantification essential for reliable deployment. To address this, we introduce a simple add-on, the diffusion last layer (DLL), a lightweight probabilistic head that can be attached to arbitrary neural operator backbones to model predictive uncertainty. Motivated by the relative smoothness and low-dimensional structure often exhibited by PDE solution distributions, DLL parameterizes the conditional output distribution directly in function space through a low-rank Karhunen-Loève expansion, enabling efficient and expressive uncertainty modeling. Across stochastic PDE operator learning benchmarks, DLL improves generalization and uncertainty-aware prediction. Moreover, even in deterministic long-horizon rollout settings, DLL enhances rollout stability and provides meaningful estimates of epistemic uncertainty for backbone neural operators.

*Jinyuan Li,Chengsong Huang,Langlin Huang,Shaoyang Xu,Haolin Liu,Wenxuan Zhang,Jiaxin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a method (Balanced-Information Score) to improve data efficiency in training Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) by reducing redundant data while maintaining or surpassing full-dataset performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the high training cost associated with large-scale MC-annotated corpora for Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) by addressing redundancy in training data.

Method: A theoretical framework is developed to analyze gradient updates' dependency on label mixtures and label reliability. Using this insight, they propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which selects subsets of data with high information content, based on existing MC signals.

Result: The BIS method significantly improves data efficiency, achieving full-dataset performance with only 10% of the training data and outperforming random data selection by 4.1%.

Conclusion: BIS offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for training MPRMs by reducing data redundancy and maintaining performance, making it highly beneficial for Visual Reasoning tasks in multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TL-GPSTGN, a method improving multivariate time series forecasting in graph-structured domains through structure-aware context optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in spatiotemporal forecasting under data scarcity and cross-domain shifts by exploring structure-aware context selection.

Method: The paper presents TL-GPSTGN, which uses information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to prune non-optimized graph contexts, creating compact subgraphs and representing them via spatiotemporal convolutional architectures.

Result: Evaluation on traffic benchmarks shows that TL-GPSTGN outperforms traditional models in low-data and transfer learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Explicitly pruning graph contexts enhances robustness and generalization in graph-based forecasting models, especially in data-constrained settings.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting in graph-structured domains is critical for real-world applications, yet existing spatiotemporal models often suffer from performance degradation under data scarcity and cross-domain shifts. We address these challenges through the lens of structure-aware context selection. We propose TL-GPSTGN, a transfer-oriented spatiotemporal framework that enhances sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization by selectively pruning non-optimized graph context. Specifically, our method employs information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to extract structurally informative subgraphs and features, resulting in a compact, semantically grounded representation. This optimized context is subsequently integrated into a spatiotemporal convolutional architecture to capture complex multivariate dynamics. Evaluations on large-scale traffic benchmarks demonstrate that TL-GPSTGN consistently outperforms baselines in low-data transfer scenarios. Our findings suggest that explicit context pruning serves as a powerful inductive bias for improving the robustness of graph-based forecasting models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ) for efficient quantization in LLMs, improving on low-bit quantization accuracy using optimized grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient LLM inference is constrained by memory limitations, with current methods failing at 2-3 bit quantization accuracy due to rigid quantization grids.

Method: BPDQ creates a variable quantization grid using bit-planes and scalar coefficients, iteratively refining the grid through second-order information and error compensation.

Result: BPDQ achieves 83.85% GSM8K accuracy for a 2-bit regime using Qwen2.5-72B on an RTX 3090, compared to 90.83% at 16-bit.

Conclusion: BPDQ expands the feasible set for quantization, aligning optimization with Hessian-induced geometry, and offers a practical solution for low-bit quantization in resource-limited LLM inference.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference is often bounded by memory footprint and memory bandwidth in resource-constrained deployments, making quantization a fundamental technique for efficient serving. While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce a shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs a variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy. In the 2-bit regime, BPDQ enables serving Qwen2.5-72B on a single RTX 3090 with 83.85% GSM8K accuracy (vs. 90.83% at 16-bit). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the variable grid expands the feasible set, and that the quantization process consistently aligns with the optimization objective in Hessian-induced geometry.

*Meiling Jin,Fei Wang,Xiaoyun Yuan,Chen Qian,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a post-pruning procedure for static sparse training that reallocates connections to enhance performance and robustness, achieving significant improvements in reinforcement learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static sparse training is efficient but suffers from reduced robustness due to early irreversible pruning decisions, especially in deep reinforcement learning, where evolving policies shift training distributions.

Method: The authors propose TAR, which performs a single revival step after static pruning by allocating a small reserve budget across layers and reactivating previously pruned connections uniformly at random, fixing the resulting structure for further training.

Result: Across continuous control reinforcement learning tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final returns of static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and shows a median gain of +13.5% compared to dynamic sparse training baselines.

Conclusion: TAR improves static sparse training by enhancing flexibility and robustness through topology-aware revival, achieving better outcomes over both static and dynamic baselines in reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Static sparse training is a promising route to efficient learning by committing to a fixed mask pattern, yet the constrained structure reduces robustness. Early pruning decisions can lock the network into a brittle structure that is difficult to escape, especially in deep reinforcement learning (RL) where the evolving policy continually shifts the training distribution. We propose Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a lightweight one-shot post-pruning procedure that improves static sparsity without dynamic rewiring. After static pruning, TAR performs a single revival step by allocating a small reserve budget across layers according to topology needs, randomly uniformly reactivating a few previously pruned connections within each layer, and then keeping the resulting connectivity fixed for the remainder of training. Across multiple continuous-control tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final return over static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and also outperforms dynamic sparse training baselines with a median gain of +13.5%.

*Xiaoyu Qiu,Taewon Yang,Zhanhao Liu,Guanyang Wang,Liyue Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of plug-and-play diffusion priors (PnPDP) in inverse problems, addressing the current gap in metrics capturing their stochastic nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for PnPDP solvers focus on point-estimate accuracy metrics, which fail to account for their stochastic nature and the desired posterior distribution in inverse problems.

Method: A systematic study was conducted, combining toy model simulations, uncertainty-driven categorization, and extensive experiments on diverse scientific inverse problems.

Result: The study reveals consistent uncertainty behaviors in alignment with theoretical justification and taxonomy, offering a systematic framework for understanding UQ in PnPDPs.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of evaluating stochastic and distributional characteristics for PnPDP solvers, providing insights for improved methodologies in scientific inverse problems.

Abstract: Plug-and-play diffusion priors (PnPDP) have become a powerful paradigm for solving inverse problems in scientific and engineering domains. Yet, current evaluations of reconstruction quality emphasize point-estimate accuracy metrics on a single sample, which do not reflect the stochastic nature of PnPDP solvers and the intrinsic uncertainty of inverse problems, critical for scientific tasks. This creates a fundamental mismatch: in inverse problems, the desired output is typically a posterior distribution and most PnPDP solvers induce a distribution over reconstructions, but existing benchmarks only evaluate a single reconstruction, ignoring distributional characterization such as uncertainty. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study to benchmark the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of existing diffusion inverse solvers. Specifically, we design a rigorous toy model simulation to evaluate the uncertainty behavior of various PnPDP solvers, and propose a UQ-driven categorization. Through extensive experiments on toy simulations and diverse real-world scientific inverse problems, we observe uncertainty behaviors consistent with our taxonomy and theoretical justification, providing new insights for evaluating and understanding the uncertainty for PnPDPs.

### [251] [LORE: Jointly Learning the Intrinsic Dimensionality and Relative Similarity Structure From Ordinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04192)
*Vivek Anand,Alec Helbling,Mark Davenport,Gordon Berman,Sankar Alagapan,Christopher Rozell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LORE, a method to learn low-dimensional representations and intrinsic dimensionality of perceptual spaces using ordinal data such as triplet comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning intrinsic dimensionality and ordinal embeddings of subjective perceptual spaces from ordinal data, which could facilitate better data interpretability and efficiency.

Method: Propose LORE, a scalable framework utilizing non-convex Schatten-p quasi norm to jointly learn dimensionality and ordinal embeddings via an iteratively reweighted optimization algorithm.

Result: LORE achieves high accuracy in learning low-dimensional embeddings, recovering latent geometry, and showing superior interpretability across synthetic, simulated, and real-world dataset experiments.

Conclusion: LORE offers a robust, interpretable, and scalable method for modeling perceptual spaces, enabling a deeper understanding of subjective percepts and paving new ways for using ordinal data in machine learning.

Abstract: Learning the intrinsic dimensionality of subjective perceptual spaces such as taste, smell, or aesthetics from ordinal data is a challenging problem. We introduce LORE (Low Rank Ordinal Embedding), a scalable framework that jointly learns both the intrinsic dimensionality and an ordinal embedding from noisy triplet comparisons of the form, "Is A more similar to B than C?". Unlike existing methods that require the embedding dimension to be set apriori, LORE regularizes the solution using the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm, enabling automatic joint recovery of both the ordinal embedding and its dimensionality. We optimize this joint objective via an iteratively reweighted algorithm and establish convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, simulated perceptual spaces, and real world crowdsourced ordinal judgements show that LORE learns compact, interpretable and highly accurate low dimensional embeddings that recover the latent geometry of subjective percepts. By simultaneously inferring both the intrinsic dimensionality and ordinal embeddings, LORE enables more interpretable and data efficient perceptual modeling in psychophysics and opens new directions for scalable discovery of low dimensional structure from ordinal data in machine learning.

*Yanjie Tong,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents STRIDE, a framework for reconstructing spatiotemporal fields using sparse measurements, achieving strong results in chaotic and sparse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing methods that struggle with generalization and mesh-independent decoders for learning parametric PDE dynamics.

Method: STRIDE is a two-stage framework combining a temporal encoder and a modulated implicit neural representation (INR) decoder, with FMMNN as the INR backbone.

Result: STRIDE demonstrates superior performance on sparse sensor benchmarks, enables super-resolution, and is robust to noise compared to baselines.

Conclusion: STRIDE effectively reconstructs high-dimensional fields with limited measurements, offering a generalizable, robust, and mesh-independent approach for PDE dynamics learning.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields from sparse point-sensor measurements is a central challenge in learning parametric PDE dynamics. Existing approaches often struggle to generalize across trajectories and parameter settings, or rely on discretization-tied decoders that do not naturally transfer across meshes and resolutions. We propose STRIDE (Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Implicit DEcoder), a two-stage framework that maps a short window of sensor measurements to a latent state with a temporal encoder and reconstructs the field at arbitrary query locations with a modulated implicit neural representation (INR) decoder. Using the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) as the INR backbone improves representation of complex spatial fields and yields more stable optimization than sine-based INRs. We provide a conditional theoretical justification: under stable delay observability of point measurements on a low-dimensional parametric invariant set, the reconstruction operator factors through a finite-dimensional embedding, making STRIDE-type architectures natural approximators. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks spanning chaotic dynamics and wave propagation show that STRIDE outperforms strong baselines under extremely sparse sensing, supports super-resolution, and remains robust to noise.

*Zeming Wei,Qiaosheng Zhang,Xia Hu,Xingcheng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) face challenges in safe response generalization against complex attack prompts. The proposed RAPO framework enhances their ability to adaptively address safety risks, improving robust alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the generalization capabilities of LRMs in refusing harmful prompts and defending against diverse and complex jailbreak attacks effectively.

Method: The authors proposed the Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework, which adaptively identifies and addresses safety risks in LRMs' reasoning processes, maintaining granularity in thinking content.

Result: Experiments confirm that the RAPO framework significantly enhances LRMs' ability to generalize safe reasoning across diverse attack prompts without compromising their general utility.

Conclusion: RAPO provides a robust alignment technique that improves LRMs' safe reasoning capabilities against advanced attack prompts, contributing to safer and more reliable reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved tremendous success with their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet also face safety issues similar to those of basic language models. In particular, while algorithms are designed to guide them to deliberately refuse harmful prompts with safe reasoning, this process often fails to generalize against diverse and complex jailbreak attacks. In this work, we attribute these failures to the generalization of the safe reasoning process, particularly their insufficiency against complex attack prompts. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity of a more sufficient safe reasoning process to defend against advanced attack prompts. Building on this insight, we propose a Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework that enables LRM to adaptively identify and address the safety risks with appropriate granularity in its thinking content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO successfully generalizes multiple LRMs' safe reasoning adaptively across diverse attack prompts whilst preserving general utility, contributing a robust alignment technique for LRM safety.

### [254] [Cascading Robustness Verification: Toward Efficient Model-Agnostic Certification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04236)
*Mohammadreza Maleki,Rushendra Sidibomma,Arman Adibi,Reza Samavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), a framework to improve neural network robustness verification by combining multiple verifiers efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is difficult to certify because formal guarantees require solving non-convex problems, and current methods either underestimate robustness or are computationally expensive.

Method: CRV uses a cascade of verifiers, beginning with the least expensive, to certify robustness. It halts early if robustness is certified and uses a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm for computationally heavy verification stages.

Result: The CRV framework achieves equal or better verified accuracy compared to powerful verifiers while improving runtime efficiency by up to ~90%.

Conclusion: CRV exposes limitations in existing robustness metrics and provides a model-agnostic, efficient framework for neural network robustness verification, balancing cost and reliability.

Abstract: Certifying neural network robustness against adversarial examples is challenging, as formal guarantees often require solving non-convex problems. Hence, incomplete verifiers are widely used because they scale efficiently and substantially reduce the cost of robustness verification compared to complete methods. However, relying on a single verifier can underestimate robustness because of loose approximations or misalignment with training methods. In this work, we propose Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), which goes beyond an engineering improvement by exposing fundamental limitations of existing robustness metric and introducing a framework that enhances both reliability and efficiency. CRV is a model-agnostic verifier, meaning that its robustness guarantees are independent of the model's training process. The key insight behind the CRV framework is that, when using multiple verification methods, an input is certifiably robust if at least one method certifies it as robust. Rather than relying solely on a single verifier with a fixed constraint set, CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers to balance the tightness of the bound and computational cost. Starting with the least expensive method, CRV halts as soon as an input is certified as robust; otherwise, it proceeds to more expensive methods. For computationally expensive methods, we introduce a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm (SR) that incrementally adds constraints and checks for certification at each step, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRV achieves equal or higher verified accuracy compared to powerful but computationally expensive incomplete verifiers in the cascade, while significantly reducing verification overhead. Empirical results confirm that CRV certifies at least as many inputs as benchmark approaches, while improving runtime efficiency by up to ~90%.

### [255] [Training A Foundation Model to Represent Graphs as Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04244)
*Qi Feng,Jicong Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph foundation model for effective graph representation, aiding graph classification and clustering tasks. It introduces a multi-graph feature alignment method and a novel algorithm to improve feature consistency across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representation methods lack generalization across diverse domains and fail to effectively preserve node-level information in graph-level tasks like classification and clustering.

Method: The authors propose a multi-graph-based feature alignment method and a density maximization mean alignment algorithm to ensure feature consistency across datasets. They also design a multi-layer reference distribution module to avoid pooling operations and enhance information preservation.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance in few-shot graph classification and graph clustering tasks, outperforming strong baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed graph foundation model successfully bridges the gap in generalization and representation quality for graph-level tasks, supported by theoretical guarantees and experimental validation.

Abstract: This paper aims to train a graph foundation model that is able to represent any graph as a vector preserving structural and semantic information useful for downstream graph-level tasks such as graph classification and graph clustering. To learn the features of graphs from diverse domains while maintaining strong generalization ability to new domains, we propose a multi-graph-based feature alignment method, which constructs weighted graphs using the attributes of all nodes in each dataset and then generates consistent node embeddings. To enhance the consistency of the features from different datasets, we propose a density maximization mean alignment algorithm with guaranteed convergence. The original graphs and generated node embeddings are fed into a graph neural network to achieve discriminative graph representations in contrastive learning. More importantly, to enhance the information preservation from node-level representations to the graph-level representation, we construct a multi-layer reference distribution module without using any pooling operation. We also provide a theoretical generalization bound to support the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results of few-shot graph classification and graph clustering show that our model outperforms strong baselines.

*Hanlin Pan,Yuhao Tang,Wanfu Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to tackle the challenges in partial multi-label learning (PML), focusing on label disambiguation and feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of label disambiguation in PML where ambiguous labels can negatively affect downstream tasks, such as feature engineering.

Method: The approach models label disambiguation and feature selection as POMDPs. It implements a two-stage framework: the first stage employs reinforcement learning to train a transformer policy for generating pseudo-labels; the second stage handles feature selection by formulating it as a sequential decision-making problem.

Result: The proposed framework shows advantages on multiple datasets and through experiments across various metrics. It introduces theoretical analysis linking PML and POMDP, along with an excess-risk bound analysis.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines label disambiguation and feature selection in PML through reinforcement learning, providing interpretable feature rankings and theoretical assurances of performance.

Abstract: In partial multi-label learning (PML), the true labels are unobserved, which makes label disambiguation important but difficult. A key challenge is that ambiguous candidate labels can propagate errors into downstream tasks such as feature engineering. To solve this issue, we jointly model the disambiguation and feature selection tasks as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to turn PML risk minimization into expected-return maximization. Stage 1 trains a transformer policy via reinforcement learning to produce high-quality hard pseudo-labels; Stage 2 describes feature selection as a sequential reinforcement learning problem, selecting features step by step and outputting an interpretable global ranking. We further provide the theoretical analysis of PML-POMDP correspondence and the excess-risk bound that decompose the error into pseudo label quality term and sample size. Experiments in multiple metrics and data sets verify the advantages of the framework.

*Ibrahim Albool,Malak Gamal El-Din,Salma Elmalaki,Yasser Shoukry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Bernstein Networks, using Bernstein polynomials as activations, offering a residual-free architecture with better trainability and representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing residual connections face structural limitations and inefficiencies in piecewise linear activations, necessitating new architectures to address gradient stagnation and representation power.

Method: The authors propose using Bernstein polynomials as activation functions, showing theoretical guarantees on gradient flow and approximation error while empirically validating their performance.

Result: The architecture reduces dead neurons drastically, improves gradient flow, and achieves exponential approximation error decay compared to ReLU-based networks.

Conclusion: Deep Bernstein Networks enable efficient training and high expressive power without residual connections, providing a promising alternative to traditional activation methods.

Abstract: Residual connections are the de facto standard for mitigating vanishing gradients, yet they impose structural constraints and fail to address the inherent inefficiencies of piecewise linear activations. We show that Deep Bernstein Networks (which utilizes Bernstein polynomials as activation functions) can act as residual-free architecture while simultaneously optimize trainability and representation power. We provide a two-fold theoretical foundation for our approach. First, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the local derivative, proving it remains strictly bounded away from zero. This directly addresses the root cause of gradient stagnation; empirically, our architecture reduces ``dead'' neurons from 90\% in standard deep networks to less than 5\%, outperforming ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU. Second, we establish that the approximation error for Bernstein-based networks decays exponentially with depth, a significant improvement over the polynomial rates of ReLU-based architectures. By unifying these results, we demonstrate that Bernstein activations provide a superior mechanism for function approximation and signal flow. Our experiments on HIGGS and MNIST confirm that Deep Bernstein Networks achieve high-performance training without skip-connections, offering a principled path toward deep, residual-free architectures with enhanced expressive capacity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dual-phase reward framework called T2T (Thickening-to-Thinning) for Reinforcement Learning in Large Language Models, addressing challenges like entropy collapse and inefficiency. It enhances performance on mathematical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle issues in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), such as entropy collapse, verbosity, and insufficient exploration, and to balance exploration and efficiency in problem-solving for better reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Proposes T2T, a dynamic reward framework with two phases: 'thickening,' which encourages exploration on incorrect attempts via longer trajectories, and 'thinning,' which imposes length penalties on correct outputs to enforce efficiency and confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that the T2T framework significantly outperforms standard methods and recent baselines, improving the reasoning and performance of Qwen-series and Deepseek models.

Conclusion: The T2T framework effectively balances exploration and efficiency in Reinforcement Learning for LLMs, advancing model reasoning and performance in mathematical problem-solving tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it frequently encounters challenges such as entropy collapse, excessive verbosity, and insufficient exploration for hard problems. Crucially, existing reward schemes fail to distinguish between the need for extensive search during problem-solving and the efficiency required for mastered knowledge. In this work, we introduce T2T(Thickening-to-Thinning), a dynamic reward framework inspired by human learning processes. Specifically, it implements a dual-phase mechanism: (1) On incorrect attempts, T2T incentivizes "thickening" (longer trajectories) to broaden the search space and explore novel solution paths; (2) Upon achieving correctness, it shifts to "thinning", imposing length penalties to discourage redundancy, thereby fostering model confidence and crystallizing reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME, AMC) across Qwen-series and Deepseek models demonstrate that T2T significantly outperforms standard GRPO and recent baselines, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Non Pneumatic tires offer a promising alternative to pneumatic tires. However, their discontinuous spoke structures present challenges in stiffness tuning, durability, and high speed vibration. This study introduces an integrated generative design and machine learning driven framework to optimize UPTIS type spoke geometries for passenger vehicles. Upper and lower spoke profiles were parameterized using high order polynomial representations, enabling the creation of approximately 250 generative designs through PCHIP based geometric variation. Machine learning models like KRR for stiffness and XGBoost for durability and vibration achieved strong predictive accuracy, reducing the reliance on computationally intensive FEM simulations. Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization further enabled extensive performance refinement. The resulting designs demonstrate 53% stiffness tunability, up to 50% durability improvement, and 43% reduction in vibration compared to the baseline. PSO provided fast, targeted convergence, while Bayesian Optimization effectively explored multi objective tradeoffs. Overall, the proposed framework enables systematic development of high performance, next generation UPTIS spoke structures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FI-Conv, a U-Net-based framework with upgraded ConvNeXt V2 blocks for predicting complex spatio-temporal dynamics and estimating parameters in systems like turbulence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a computationally efficient and accurate framework for predicting system evolutions and inferring parameters in highly nonlinear and dynamic systems such as turbulent plasmas.

Method: FI-Conv combines a U-Net structure with ConvNeXt V2 blocks for enhanced performance in high-frequency scenarios. It uses inputs like initial states, PDE parameters, and evolution time to predict system states. Additionally, an inverse estimation method is implemented for parameter inference using gradient descent.

Result: FI-Conv accurately predicts turbulent plasma fields from Hasegawa-Wakatani equations over short times and maintains statistical accuracy over long times. Its inverse estimation accurately infers PDE parameters without retraining the model.

Conclusion: FI-Conv demonstrates potential as a robust alternative to traditional physics-informed machine learning, offering adaptability to complex spatio-temporal systems with high computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose the Convolutional Operator Network for Forward and Inverse Problems (FI-Conv), a framework capable of predicting system evolution and estimating parameters in complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as turbulence. FI-Conv is built on a U-Net architecture, in which most convolutional layers are replaced by ConvNeXt V2 blocks. This design preserves U-Net performance on inputs with high-frequency variations while maintaining low computational complexity. FI-Conv uses an initial state, PDE parameters, and evolution time as input to predict the system future state. As a representative example of a system exhibiting complex dynamics, we evaluate the performance of FI-Conv on the task of predicting turbulent plasma fields governed by the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations. The HW system models two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence and exhibits strongly nonlinear behavior, making accurate approximation and long-term prediction particularly challenging. Using an autoregressive forecasting procedure, FI-Conv achieves accurate forward prediction of the plasma state evolution over short times (t ~ 3) and captures the statistic properties of derived physical quantities of interest over longer times (t ~ 100). Moreover, we develop a gradient-descent-based inverse estimation method that accurately infers PDE parameters from plasma state evolution data, without modifying the trained model weights. Collectively, our results demonstrate that FI-Conv can be an effective alternative to existing physics-informed machine learning methods for systems with complex spatio-temporal dynamics.

*Sudipto Ghosh,Sujoy Nath,Sunny Manchanda,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents INFORM, a method for analyzing orchestration in multi-expert systems, highlighting differences between expert selection frequency and functional importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency in orchestrating multiple LLMs, which collaborate for complex tasks, by analyzing interactions and causal relationships in orchestration.

Method: The authors introduced INFORM, an interpretability analysis framework, and evaluated it using multiple datasets (GSM8K, HumanEval, MMLU) with homogeneous and heterogeneous expert consortia.

Result: INFORM revealed that frequently selected experts often lack causal significance, while sparsely routed ones contribute structurally. Orchestration evolves asynchronously, with varying expert importance.

Conclusion: INFORM effectively decouples interaction structures and importance in multi-expert systems, exposing dependencies missed by accuracy-focused metrics.

Abstract: Multi-expert systems, where multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) collaborate to solve complex tasks, are increasingly adopted for high-performance reasoning and generation. However, the orchestration policies governing expert interaction and sequencing remain largely opaque. We introduce INFORM, an interpretability analysis that treats orchestration as an explicit, analyzable computation, enabling the decoupling of expert interaction structure, execution order, and causal attribution. We use INFORM to evaluate an orchestrator on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MMLU using a homogeneous consortium of ten instruction-tuned experts drawn from LLaMA-3.1 8B, Qwen-3 8B, and DeepSeek-R1 8B, with controlled decoding-temperature variation, and a secondary heterogeneous consortium spanning 1B-7B parameter models. Across tasks, routing dominance is a poor proxy for functional necessity. We reveal a divergence between relational importance, captured by routing mass and interaction topology, and intrinsic importance, measured via gradient-based causal attribution: frequently selected experts often act as interaction hubs with limited causal influence, while sparsely routed experts can be structurally critical. Orchestration behaviors emerge asynchronously, with expert centralization preceding stable routing confidence and expert ordering remaining non-deterministic. Targeted ablations show that masking intrinsically important experts induces disproportionate collapse in interaction structure compared to masking frequent peers, confirming that INFORM exposes causal and structural dependencies beyond accuracy metrics alone.

Motivation: The prediction of high-order tensor properties from atomic structures is challenging due to computational inefficiencies in current models using Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. The need for an efficient and accurate approach to tackle this issue is the key motivation.

Method: The paper introduces CEITNet, a model that uses Cartesian local environment tensors and learnable channel-space interactions for efficient and accurate tensor property predictions. It avoids computational bottlenecks by operating in channel space and assembling outputs using Cartesian tensor bases.

Result: CEITNet achieves higher accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets, specifically for dielectric (order-2), piezoelectric (order-3), and elastic (order-4) tensor predictions.

Conclusion: The CEITNet approach demonstrates significant improvement in both performance and efficiency for high-order tensor property predictions, making it a promising solution for atomic-level material analysis.

Abstract: End-to-end prediction of high-order crystal tensor properties from atomic structures remains challenging: while spherical-harmonic equivariant models are expressive, their Clebsch-Gordan tensor products incur substantial compute and memory costs for higher-order targets. We propose the Cartesian Environment Interaction Tensor Network (CEITNet), an approach that constructs a multi-channel Cartesian local environment tensor for each atom and performs flexible many-body mixing via a learnable channel-space interaction. By performing learning in channel space and using Cartesian tensor bases to assemble equivariant outputs, CEITNet enables efficient construction of high-order tensor. Across benchmark datasets for order-2 dielectric, order-3 piezoelectric, and order-4 elastic tensor prediction, CEITNet surpasses prior high-order prediction methods on key accuracy criteria while offering high computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) for advanced search strategies, improving reasoning and task performance.

Method: The authors propose UnMaskFork (UMF), modeling the unmasking trajectory as a search tree and using Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimization, employing deterministic actions with multiple MDLMs.

Result: The UMF framework outperforms traditional scaling methods on coding tasks and scales well for mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: UMF demonstrates the effective use of MDLMs for enhanced performance in reasoning tasks, outperforming existing test-time scaling baselines.

Abstract: Test-time scaling strategies have effectively leveraged inference-time compute to enhance the reasoning abilities of Autoregressive Large Language Models. In this work, we demonstrate that Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) are inherently amenable to advanced search strategies, owing to their iterative and non-autoregressive generation process. To leverage this, we propose UnMaskFork (UMF), a framework that formulates the unmasking trajectory as a search tree and employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize the generation path. In contrast to standard scaling methods relying on stochastic sampling, UMF explores the search space through deterministic partial unmasking actions performed by multiple MDLMs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that UMF consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling baselines on complex coding benchmarks, while also exhibiting strong scalability on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MirrorLA, an improved linear attention framework that overcomes semantic information loss by employing learnable geometric transformations to retain representational fidelity, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention methods reduce complexity but suffer performance drops due to the non-negativity constraints of kernel feature maps, which truncate semantic information.

Method: The paper proposes MirrorLA, which uses Householder reflections to actively reorient feature geometry. It incorporates multi-scale designs optimizing discriminability locally, stabilizing long contexts via activation diversification, and enhancing global covariance by subspace integration.

Result: MirrorLA achieves state-of-the-art results in standard benchmarks, showing competitive representational fidelity with linear computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MirrorLA demonstrates that it is possible to maintain linear efficiency in attention mechanisms without sacrificing performance by addressing geometric constraints in feature representation.

Abstract: Linear attention significantly reduces the computational complexity of Transformers from quadratic to linear, yet it consistently lags behind softmax-based attention in performance. We identify the root cause of this degradation as the non-negativity constraint imposed on kernel feature maps: standard projections like ReLU act as "passive truncation" operators, indiscriminately discarding semantic information residing in the negative domain. We propose MirrorLA, a geometric framework that substitutes passive truncation with active reorientation. By leveraging learnable Householder reflections, MirrorLA rotates the feature geometry into the non-negative orthant to maximize information retention. Our approach restores representational density through a cohesive, multi-scale design: it first optimizes local discriminability via block-wise isometries, stabilizes long-context dynamics using variance-aware modulation to diversify activations, and finally, integrates dispersed subspaces via cross-head reflections to induce global covariance mixing. MirrorLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, demonstrating that strictly linear efficiency can be achieved without compromising representational fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of communication inefficiencies and dispersed learning performance in decentralized learning environments where central data hosting is not feasible.

Method: The method involves model decomposition into fragments which are disseminated independently across the network. This approach minimizes redundant communication and leverages parameter correlation to improve contraction metrics.

Result: Mosaic Learning achieves up to 12 percentage points higher node-level accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art epidemic learning baseline and demonstrates theoretically optimal worst-case convergence rates.

Conclusion: Mosaic Learning is an effective and efficient framework for decentralized learning that enhances both performance and information propagation, setting a new standard for the field.

Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) enables collaborative machine learning (ML) without a central server, making it suitable for settings where training data cannot be centrally hosted. We introduce Mosaic Learning, a DL framework that decomposes models into fragments and disseminates them independently across the network. Fragmentation reduces redundant communication across correlated parameters and enables more diverse information propagation without increasing communication cost. We theoretically show that Mosaic Learning (i) shows state-of-the-art worst-case convergence rate, and (ii) leverages parameter correlation in an ML model, improving contraction by reducing the highest eigenvalue of a simplified system. We empirically evaluate Mosaic Learning on four learning tasks and observe up to 12 percentage points higher node-level test accuracy compared to epidemic learning (EL), a state-of-the-art baseline. In summary, Mosaic Learning improves DL performance without sacrificing its utility or efficiency, and positions itself as a new DL standard.

### [268] [EXaMCaP: Subset Selection with Entropy Gain Maximization for Probing Capability Gains of Large Chart Understanding Training Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04365)
*Jiapeng Liu,Liang Li,Bing Li,Peng Fu,Xiyan Gao,Chengyang Fang,Xiaoshuai Hao,Can Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EXaMCaP, a method for selecting high-diversity subsets of the ChartU dataset to efficiently assess MLLM capability gains without full-set fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiency of full-set fine-tuning MLLMs, which delays iterative refinement of Chart Understanding datasets.

Method: The authors propose EXaMCaP, a method based on entropy gain maximization, which iteratively selects subsets of high diversity from the ChartU dataset without evaluating all possible combinations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that EXaMCaP effectively probes MLLMs' capability gains, outperforming other baselines across subset sizes and architectures.

Conclusion: EXaMCaP offers an efficient and effective way to evaluate ChartU dataset sufficiency, advancing MLLM performance assessment with reduced time costs.

Abstract: Recent works focus on synthesizing Chart Understanding (ChartU) training sets to inject advanced chart knowledge into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where the sufficiency of the knowledge is typically verified by quantifying capability gains via the fine-tune-then-evaluate paradigm. However, full-set fine-tuning MLLMs to assess such gains incurs significant time costs, hindering the iterative refinement cycles of the ChartU dataset. Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset. Experiments show that EXaMCaP outperforms baselines in probing the capability gains of the ChartU training set, along with its strong effectiveness across diverse subset sizes and compatibility with various MLLM architectures.

*Zongjiang Shang,Dongliang Cui,Binqing Wu,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSH-LLM, a method for aligning large language models with time series analysis using a multi-scale hypergraph approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 27 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of effectively aligning modalities between natural language and time series data, particularly considering their multi-scale structures.

Method: The proposed method incorporates a multi-scale hypergraph mechanism with hyperedging to represent semantic information, a cross-modality alignment module, and a mixture of prompts to improve contextual understanding of temporal patterns.

Result: MSH-LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance in experiments conducted on 27 real-world datasets, spanning 5 different applications.

Conclusion: The integration of multi-scale structures and cross-modality alignment enables LLMs to better understand time series data, paving the way for more effective analysis in this domain.

Abstract: Recently, there has been great success in leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis. The core idea lies in effectively aligning the modality between natural language and time series. However, the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLMs capabilities. To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series. Experimental results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 different applications demonstrate that MSH-LLM achieves the state-of-the-art results.

*Geethen Singh,Jasper A Slingsby,Tamara B Robinson,Glenn Moncrieff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semi-supervised framework, 'Common Ground,' for temporal generalization in Earth Observation data classification without requiring consistent updating of reference labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting new labeled data for Earth Observation at each time step is costly and logistically challenging, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems.

Method: The approach leverages semi-supervised learning and stable regions (with little spectral or semantic change) to provide implicit supervision, enabling improved classification across time without requiring constantly updated labels.

Result: The 'Common Ground' method improves classification accuracy by 21-40% for invasive species mapping and 2% for land cover categories across various conditions, outperforming a naive and gold-standard approach.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates scalability, label efficiency, and effective temporal generalization for remote sensing classification, reducing dependence on manual label updates.

Abstract: Reliable classification of Earth Observation data depends on consistent, up-to-date reference labels. However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, "Common Ground", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stable reference screening with SSL for scalable and label-efficient multi-temporal remote sensing classification.

### [271] [Beyond KL Divergence: Policy Optimization with Flexible Bregman Divergences for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04380)
*Rui Yuan,Mykola Khandoga,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Group-Based Mirror Policy Optimization (GBMPO), which applies flexible Bregman divergences (instead of traditional KL divergence) to group-based policy optimization, achieving improved performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the previously unexamined choice of divergence functions in group-based policy optimization, as existing methods only utilize KL divergence despite its limitations.

Method: The authors propose GBMPO, which generalizes policy optimization using flexible Bregman divergences such as L2 in probability space and neural mirror maps, trained via evolutionary strategies or random initialization.

Result: On GSM8K (mathematical reasoning), the method achieves a 5.5% accuracy improvement over the baseline, and on MBPP (code generation), it achieves 60.1-60.8% pass@1 accuracy, with benefits like variance reduction and efficiency gains.

Conclusion: The choice of divergence function is a critical and underexplored dimension in group-based policy optimization, with GBMPO offering significant advancements for tasks requiring LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Policy optimization methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants have achieved strong results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Despite extensive exploration of reward processing strategies and training dynamics, all existing group-based methods exclusively use KL divergence for policy regularization, leaving the choice of divergence function unexplored. We introduce Group-Based Mirror Policy Optimization (GBMPO), a framework that extends group-based policy optimization to flexible Bregman divergences, including hand-designed alternatives (L2 in probability space) and learned neural mirror maps. On GSM8K mathematical reasoning, hand-designed ProbL2-GRPO achieves 86.7% accuracy, improving +5.5 points over the Dr. GRPO baseline. On MBPP code generation, neural mirror maps reach 60.1-60.8% pass@1, with random initialization already capturing most of the benefit. While evolutionary strategies meta-learning provides marginal accuracy improvements, its primary value lies in variance reduction ($\pm$0.2 versus $\pm$0.6) and efficiency gains (15% shorter responses on MBPP), suggesting that random initialization of neural mirror maps is sufficient for most practical applications. These results establish divergence choice as a critical, previously unexplored design dimension in group-based policy optimization for LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stemmed from the need to reduce food waste while addressing privacy concerns that prevent data sharing among grocery retailers.

Method: The paper develops a Blockchain-based Federated Learning model that enables collaborative demand forecasting across retailers without necessitating direct data sharing.

Result: Preliminary findings indicate that the FL model performs almost as well as scenarios where data is shared directly, and significantly better than isolated predictive models, leading to reduced waste and enhanced efficiency.

Conclusion: Blockchain-based FL can provide a practical solution for collaborative demand forecasting in grocery retail, supporting both sustainability and data privacy.

Abstract: Effective demand forecasting is crucial for reducing food waste. However, data privacy concerns often hinder collaboration among retailers, limiting the potential for improved predictive accuracy. In this study, we explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), with a focus on the grocery retail sector dealing with perishable goods. We develop a baseline predictive model for demand forecasting and waste assessment in an isolated retailer scenario. Subsequently, we introduce a Blockchain-based FL model, trained collaboratively across multiple retailers without direct data sharing. Our preliminary results show that FL models have performance almost equivalent to the ideal setting in which parties share data with each other, and are notably superior to models built by individual parties without sharing data, cutting waste and boosting efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper creates a diverse dataset of neural networks using large language models for systematic evaluation of tools aimed at verifying reliability and adaptability in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available, diverse datasets hinders systematic evaluations of tools used for validating neural network correctness and maintainability.

Method: Large language models are utilized to automatically generate neural network datasets covering diverse architectural designs, tasks, and data types. Static analysis and symbolic tracing validate their correctness.

Result: 608 neural network samples were systematically designed, validated for correctness, and made publicly available.

Conclusion: The generated dataset facilitates systematic evaluation of tools ensuring neural network reliability and adaptability, advancing research in this domain.

Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used to support decision-making. To verify their reliability and adaptability, researchers and practitioners have proposed a variety of tools and methods for tasks such as NN code verification, refactoring, and migration. These tools play a crucial role in guaranteeing both the correctness and maintainability of neural network architectures, helping to prevent implementation errors, simplify model updates, and ensure that complex networks can be reliably extended and reused. Yet, assessing their effectiveness remains challenging due to the lack of publicly diverse datasets of neural networks that would allow systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a dataset of neural networks that can serve as a benchmark for validation. The dataset is designed to cover diverse architectural components and to handle multiple input data types and tasks. In total, 608 samples are generated, each conforming to a set of precise design choices. To further ensure their consistency, we validate the correctness of the generated networks using static analysis and symbolic tracing. We make the dataset publicly available to support the community in advancing research on neural network reliability and adaptability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoRDO, a method unifying low-rank optimization and infrequent synchronization, to minimize bandwidth issues in distributed training, achieving efficiency gains and lower memory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent bandwidth limitations of distributed data parallel (DDP) training in foundation models, and overcome memory and communication bottlenecks in optimizer states.

Method: The authors propose LoRDO, which combines low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization and utilizes full-rank quasi-hyperbolic updates to restore exploration capacity in low-rank subspaces.

Result: LoRDO achieves near-parity in performance with low-rank DDP while reducing communication costs by ~10x across language models ranging from 125M to 720M parameters, particularly excelling in low-memory configurations.

Conclusion: LoRDO effectively reduces communication constraints in distributed training, maintaining model performance and enabling efficient training even under stringent memory constraints.

Abstract: Distributed training of foundation models via $\texttt{DDP}$ is limited by interconnect bandwidth. While infrequent communication strategies reduce synchronization frequency, they remain bottlenecked by the memory and communication requirements of optimizer states. Low-rank optimizers can alleviate these constraints; however, in the local-update regime, workers lack access to the full-batch gradients required to compute low-rank projections, which degrades performance. We propose $\texttt{LoRDO}$, a principled framework unifying low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization. We first demonstrate that, while global projections based on pseudo-gradients are theoretically superior, they permanently restrict the optimization trajectory to a low-rank subspace. To restore subspace exploration, we introduce a full-rank quasi-hyperbolic update. $\texttt{LoRDO}$ achieves near-parity with low-rank $\texttt{DDP}$ in language modeling and downstream tasks at model scales of $125$M--$720$M, while reducing communication by $\approx 10 \times$. Finally, we show that $\texttt{LoRDO}$ improves performance even more in very low-memory settings with small rank/batch size.

*Beatrice Achilli,Marco Benedetti,Giulio Biroli,Marc Mézard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the qualitative transitions, termed as speciation transitions, in diffusion models that commit samples to specific data classes during the generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formulate a general theoretical framework for understanding speciation transitions in diffusion models, which extend beyond simple settings like Gaussian mixtures.

Method: Developed a general theory using Bayes classification, free-entropy differences, and replica methodology to formalize and characterize speciation transitions across complex target distributions.

Result: The theory successfully generalizes speciation transitions to scenarios involving higher-order and collective features, and predicts successive transitions for finer granularity across multiple classes.

Conclusion: This work expands the theoretical understanding of diffusion models, offering broad applicability and explicit predictions for class commitment in generative processes.

Abstract: Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.

*Lunjun Zhang,Jimmy Ba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMA-based techniques to enhance Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving significant performance improvements in math reasoning and agentic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RL algorithms for LLM training by addressing stability and performance challenges using new methodologies.

Method: The authors propose two techniques: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as an anchor policy and the Top-k KL estimator for stability and performance in RL algorithms.

Result: The proposed techniques (EMA-PG) enable significant improvement, e.g., boosting OlympiadBench math reasoning scores to 53.9% and enhancing Q&A performance significantly across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: EMA-PG is a straightforward and effective approach for scaling RL in LLMs, yielding substantial performance boosts across tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire increasingly complex reasoning and agentic behaviors. In this work, we propose two simple techniques to improve policy gradient algorithms for LLMs. First, we replace the fixed anchor policy during RL with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), similar to a target network in deep Q-learning. Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO. On agentic RL domains, with Qwen-3B base, EMA-PG improves GRPO by an average of 33.3% across 7 datasets of Q&A with search engines, including 29.7% $\rightarrow$ 44.1% on HotpotQA, 27.4% $\rightarrow$ 40.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA. Overall, we show that EMA-PG is a simple, principled, and powerful approach to scaling RL for LLMs. Code: https://github.com/LunjunZhang/ema-pg

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaMa, an algorithm to design safe LLM-based multi-agent systems against adversarial threats by framing it as a security game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study stems from the need to ensure safety in LLM-based systems, especially when some agents fail or act adversarially.

Method: It introduces MaMa, which uses iterative LLM-based adversarial search for designing resilient systems by simulating attacks and feedback in a security game framework.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that MaMa-designed systems defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance, even in scenarios beyond training settings.

Conclusion: MaMa effectively balances safety and task success, creating robust systems adaptable to diverse adversaries and attack goals.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but they also introduce significant safety risks when individual agents fail or behave adversarially. In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success. Moreover, the resulting systems generalize to stronger adversaries, as well as ones with different attack objectives or underlying LLMs, demonstrating robust safety beyond the training setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight and computationally efficient Echo State Network (ESN) approach for hand gesture recognition based on radar signals, achieving high performance while addressing computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for computationally efficient techniques for hand gesture recognition in resource-constrained environments, especially for in-vehicle and robotic systems where Doppler radar signals are often used.

Method: The method involves preprocessing raw radar signals into feature maps and then processing them with multi-reservoir Echo State Networks (ESNs). The states generated by the reservoirs are classified using algorithms like ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests.

Result: The ESN approach outperforms existing techniques on datasets including Soli and Dop-NET, showing superior recognition performance with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: This study validates ESN's capability in radar-based HGR tasks with promising recognition results for human computer interaction applications, particularly suitable for environments facing computational limitations.

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a fundamental technology in human computer interaction (HCI).In particular, HGR based on Doppler radar signals is suited for in-vehicle interfaces and robotic systems, necessitating lightweight and computationally efficient recognition techniques. However, conventional deep learning-based methods still suffer from high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains. Our ESN approaches achieve high recognition performance with low computational cost in HGR, showing great potential for more advanced HCI technologies, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture-of-Masters (MoM), a chess model with multiple smaller GPT expert networks trained to emulate grandmasters, that dynamically adapts strategies and outperforms baselines in generating diverse and high-quality chess moves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of homogenization in conventional dense transformer chess models, which suppresses stylistic diversity and rare effective strategies.

Method: The authors propose MoM, a mixture-of-experts model with smaller GPT experts trained with self-supervised and reinforcement learning, employing a learnable gating mechanism to dynamically select the most relevant expert persona for each game state.

Result: MoM demonstrates competitive performance against Stockfish, surpassing individual dense networks and GPT baselines, while achieving superior generation variety, control, and interpretability.

Conclusion: MoM showcases the potential of mixture-of-experts models in preserving stylistic diversity and dynamic adaptation in chess, providing better quality, variety, and strategic control than traditional dense networks.

Abstract: Modern chess language models are dense transformers trained on millions of games played by thousands of high-rated individuals. However, these monolithic networks tend to collapse into mode-averaged behavior, where stylistic boundaries are blurred, and rare but effective strategies are suppressed. To counteract homogenization, we introduce Mixture-of-Masters (MoM), the first chess mixture-of-experts model with small-sized GPT experts emulating world-class grandmasters. Each expert is trained with a combination of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning guided by chess-specific rewards. For each move, a post-hoc learnable gating network selects the most appropriate persona to channel depending on the game state, allowing MoM to switch its style dynamically$--$e.g., Tal's offensive vocation or Petrosian's defensive solidity. When evaluated against Stockfish on unseen standard games, MoM outperforms both dense individual expert networks and popular GPT baselines trained on aggregated data, while ensuring generation variety, control, and interpretability.

*Jiacheng Liang,Yuhui Wang,Tanqiu Jiang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes RASA, a method to achieve safety alignment in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models, addressing the challenges presented by sparse routing mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve challenges in achieving safety alignment for MoE models, where naive full-parameter fine-tuning leads to degenerate behaviors instead of direct repair of Safety-Critical Experts.

Method: RASA selectively repairs Safety-Critical Experts by identifying experts activated during successful jailbreaks, fixing these experts under stable routing, and enforcing routing consistency with safety-aligned contexts.

Result: RASA demonstrated near-perfect robustness, cross-attack generalization, and minimal over-refusal issues while retaining capabilities on key benchmarks like MMLU, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA.

Conclusion: Robust safety alignment in MoE models is achievable through targeted expert repair rather than full-parameter updates, which preserves architecture integrity and improves safety.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models introduce unique challenges for safety alignment due to their sparse routing mechanisms, which can enable degenerate optimization behaviors under standard full-parameter fine-tuning. In our preliminary experiments, we observe that naively applying full-parameter safety fine-tuning to MoE models can reduce attack success rates through routing or expert dominance effects, rather than by directly repairing Safety-Critical Experts. To address this challenge, we propose RASA, a routing-aware expert-level alignment framework that explicitly repairs Safety-Critical Experts while preventing routing-based bypasses. RASA identifies experts disproportionately activated by successful jailbreaks, selectively fine-tunes only these experts under fixed routing, and subsequently enforces routing consistency with safety-aligned contexts. Across two representative MoE architectures and a diverse set of jailbreak attacks, RASA achieves near-perfect robustness, strong cross-attack generalization, and substantially reduced over-refusal, while preserving general capabilities on benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA. Our results suggest that robust MoE safety alignment benefits from targeted expert repair rather than global parameter updates, offering a practical and architecture-preserving alternative to prior approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Greedy-Gnorm, a dynamic head pruning algorithm, for transformer model compression, outperforming static methods and preserving accuracy better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the inefficiency of static importance scores in attention head pruning and create a more effective, dynamic, and energy-efficient pruning method.

Method: The authors propose Greedy-Gnorm, which dynamically recalculates head importance scores based on the gradient information (using l2-norm of Q/K/V gradient blocks) and updates it iteratively during the pruning process.

Result: Greedy-Gnorm outperforms existing static pruning methods, preserving accuracy better during substantial head removal in transformer models (e.g., BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa).

Conclusion: Greedy-Gnorm offers a significant advancement in energy-efficient model compression with improved accuracy preservation, marking a step forward in Green AI.

Abstract: Attention head pruning has emerged as an effective technique for transformer model compression, an increasingly important goal in the era of Green AI. However, existing pruning methods often rely on static importance scores, which fail to capture the evolving role of attention heads during iterative removal. We propose Greedy-Gradient norm (Greedy-Gnorm), a novel head pruning algorithm that dynamically recalculates head importance after each pruning step. Specifically, each head is scored by the elementwise product of the l2-norms of its Q/K/V gradient blocks, as estimated from a hold-out validation set and updated at every greedy iteration. This dynamic approach to scoring mitigates against stale rankings and better reflects gradient-informed importance as pruning progresses. Extensive experiments on BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa demonstrate that Greedy-Gnorm consistently preserves accuracy under substantial head removal, outperforming attention entropy.

*Abdulrahman Alotaibi,Irene Tenison,Miriam Kim,Isaac Lee,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA), a novel training paradigm for improving Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous non-IID client distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces significant challenges in real-world web systems due to non-IID client distributions, which degrade the performance of traditional FL models.

Method: The approach introduces 'Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA),' which trains FL models using a forget-and-evolve schedule. Training is divided into generations, and after each generation, select parameters are reinitialized either randomly or from later layers to avoid local minima.

Result: Results show that the IFA method achieves a significant improvement (21.5% on average) in generalization performance across datasets like CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs, particularly under non-IID data scenarios.

Conclusion: IFA enhances Federated Learning by improving performance in heterogeneous settings, making it suitable for distributed, privacy-preserving web systems.

Abstract: The Web is naturally heterogeneous with user devices, geographic regions, browsing patterns, and contexts all leading to highly diverse, unique datasets. Federated Learning (FL) is an important paradigm for the Web because it enables privacy-preserving, collaborative machine learning across diverse user devices, web services and clients without needing to centralize sensitive data. However, its performance degrades severely under non-IID client distributions that is prevalent in real-world web systems. In this work, we propose a new training paradigm - Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA) - that enhances generalization in heterogeneous federated settings through generation-wise forget and evolve strategy. Specifically, we divide training into multiple generations and, at the end of each, select a fraction of model parameters (a) randomly or (b) from the later layers of the model and reinitialize them. This iterative forget and evolve schedule allows the model to escape local minima and preserve globally relevant representations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs datasets show that the proposed approach improves global accuracy, especially when the data cross clients are Non-IID. This method can be implemented on top any federated algorithm to improve its generalization performance. We observe an average of 21.5%improvement across datasets. This work advances the vision of scalable, privacy-preserving intelligence for real-world heterogeneous and distributed web systems.

*Sander de Haan,Yassine Taoudi-Benchekroun,Pau Vilimelis Aceituno,Benjamin F. Grewe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to address catastrophic forgetting in neural networks by reformulating continual learning as a competition between learning and preservation signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting that neural networks face when trained sequentially on multiple tasks.

Method: The authors introduce a control problem framework where preservation signals are converted from regularization penalties, allowing the model to preserve prior-task representations implicitly via continual-natural gradient without storing explicit curvature.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the framework recovers accurate prior-task curvature and achieves superior task discrimination on standard benchmarks compared to existing methods without using replay.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances task discrimination, offering a promising continual learning solution for neural networks.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge for neural networks when tasks are trained sequentially. In this work, we reformulate continual learning as a control problem where learning and preservation signals compete within neural activity dynamics. We convert regularization penalties into preservation signals that protect prior-task representations. Learning then proceeds by minimizing the control effort required to integrate new tasks while competing with the preservation of prior tasks. At equilibrium, the neural activities produce weight updates that implicitly encode the full prior-task curvature, a property we term the continual-natural gradient, requiring no explicit curvature storage. Experiments confirm that our learning framework recovers true prior-task curvature and enables task discrimination, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmarks without replay.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a continual learning method using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS) to balance plasticity and stability efficiently, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and complex strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in learning from a stream of tasks by creating an efficient balance between plasticity and stability.

Method: Reformulate the continual learning objective using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS) to decouple learning goals into two objectives, iteratively finding consensus through proximal operators.

Result: Demonstrated efficient continual learning without external modules or complex strategies, achieving stability and plasticity.

Conclusion: The proposed DRS-based methodology provides a simpler and powerful framework for continual learning systems.

Abstract: Learning from a stream of tasks usually pits plasticity against stability: acquiring new knowledge often causes catastrophic forgetting of past information. Most methods address this by summing competing loss terms, creating gradient conflicts that are managed with complex and often inefficient strategies such as external memory replay or parameter regularization. We propose a reformulation of the continual learning objective using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS). This reframes the learning process not as a direct trade-off, but as a negotiation between two decoupled objectives: one promoting plasticity for new tasks and the other enforcing stability of old knowledge. By iteratively finding a consensus through their proximal operators, DRS provides a more principled and stable learning dynamic. Our approach achieves an efficient balance between stability and plasticity without the need for auxiliary modules or complex add-ons, providing a simpler yet more powerful paradigm for continual learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based label spreading method to estimate uncertainties in labels for AI perception tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on image dataset benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in safe AI for perception tasks caused by a lack of data with accurate and uncertainty-based label annotations, while also making annotation methods scalable.

Method: Introduced a probabilistic label spreading approach using graph-based diffusion to propagate single annotations while estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, ensuring consistency even with minimal annotations.

Result: The method improves label quality with reduced annotation efforts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Data-Centric Image Classification benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively estimates uncertainties in labels while reducing the annotation burden, offering a scalable solution for high-quality annotations in perception tasks.

Abstract: Safe artificial intelligence for perception tasks remains a major challenge, partly due to the lack of data with high-quality labels. Annotations themselves are subject to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which is typically ignored during annotation and evaluation. While crowdsourcing enables collecting multiple annotations per image to estimate these uncertainties, this approach is impractical at scale due to the required annotation effort. We introduce a probabilistic label spreading method that provides reliable estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of labels. Assuming label smoothness over the feature space, we propagate single annotations using a graph-based diffusion method. We prove that label spreading yields consistent probability estimators even when the number of annotations per data point converges to zero. We present and analyze a scalable implementation of our method. Experimental results indicate that, compared to baselines, our approach substantially reduces the annotation budget required to achieve a desired label quality on common image datasets and achieves a new state of the art on the Data-Centric Image Classification benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel formulation for constrained reinforcement learning using stochastic decision horizons, improving sample efficiency, scalability, and handling constraints effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of handling constraints, like safety, in reinforcement learning methods where typical approaches suffer from scalability issues, especially in off-policy settings.

Method: The authors propose a "Control as Inference" framework with stochastic decision horizons, survival-weighted objectives, and novel violation semantics (absorbing and virtual termination). These methods enable replay-compatible off-policy actor-critic learning.

Result: Experiments show the proposed methods improve sample efficiency and return-violation trade-offs on standard benchmarks. The VT-MPO algorithm also scales well to high-dimensional simulations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and efficient method for constrained reinforcement learning, offering practical advantages for high-dimensional problems and better handling of constraints.

Abstract: Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) provide a principled model for handling constraints, such as safety and other auxiliary objectives, in reinforcement learning. The common approach of using additive-cost constraints and dual variables often hinders off-policy scalability. We propose a Control as Inference formulation based on stochastic decision horizons, where constraint violations attenuate reward contributions and shorten the effective planning horizon via state-action-dependent continuation. This yields survival-weighted objectives that remain replay-compatible for off-policy actor-critic learning. We propose two violation semantics, absorbing and virtual termination, that share the same survival-weighted return but result in distinct optimization structures that lead to SAC/MPO-style policy improvement. Experiments demonstrate improved sample efficiency and favorable return-violation trade-offs on standard benchmarks. Moreover, MPO with virtual termination (VT-MPO) scales effectively to our high-dimensional musculoskeletal Hyfydy setup.

*Maya Janvier,Julien Salomon,Etienne Meunier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes regularization methods for Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) to improve stability and accuracy in long-term simulations with significantly reduced training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NDEs are important for modeling physical systems but face challenges in stability and accuracy during long-term integration, especially with short training rollouts.

Method: The paper introduces two Jacobian regularization techniques using directional derivatives: one for known dynamics with direct derivation, and another for unknown dynamics using finite difference approximations.

Result: Both proposed techniques improved the stability and accuracy of long-term simulations, tested on several ordinary and partial differential equations, while being computationally efficient compared to long training rollouts.

Conclusion: The developed regularizations effectively address the challenges of training NDEs for long-term integration, enabling their application to large-scale systems.

Abstract: Hybrid models and Neural Differential Equations (NDE) are getting increasingly important for the modeling of physical systems, however they often encounter stability and accuracy issues during long-term integration. Training on unrolled trajectories is known to limit these divergences but quickly becomes too expensive due to the need for computing gradients over an iterative process. In this paper, we demonstrate that regularizing the Jacobian of the NDE model via its directional derivatives during training stabilizes long-term integration in the challenging context of short training rollouts. We design two regularizations, one for the case of known dynamics where we can directly derive the directional derivatives of the dynamic and one for the case of unknown dynamics where they are approximated using finite differences. Both methods, while having a far lower cost compared to long rollouts during training, are successful in improving the stability of long-term simulations for several ordinary and partial differential equations, opening up the door to training NDE methods for long-term integration of large scale systems.

*Xianbiao Qi,Marco Chen,Jiaquan Ye,Yelin He,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates Muon optimizer, comparing its spectral perspective with Adam and introducing new variants and computation methods, concluding its performance as a stabilization tool, but not universally superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon optimizer's recent empirical success requires a deeper understanding of its mechanisms and comparison to adaptive optimizers like Adam.

Method: The study employs a spectral transformation framework across a range of p values for updates and introduces efficient computation via coupled Newton iteration, analyzing performance through controlled experiments.

Result: RMS-normalized gradient updates ensure stable optimization while spectral compression improves stability under first-moment updates; Muon (p = 0) does not consistently surpass Adam.

Conclusion: Muon is effective for spectral normalization rather than being a universally superior optimizer; highlighting its role as a stabilization tool.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has recently attracted considerable attention for its strong empirical performance and use of orthogonalized updates on matrix-shaped parameters, yet its underlying mechanisms and relationship to adaptive optimizers such as Adam remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \boldsymbolΣ^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method.

*Chenxi Hu,Yue Ma,Yifan Wu,Yunhe Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaCNP, a probabilistic model for forecasting electricity load during extreme weather, addressing abrupt changes in consumption patterns and data scarcity by evaluating historical contexts for adaptation. AdaCNP demonstrates robustness and reliability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate electricity load forecasting during extreme weather is crucial to avoid power system disruptions but challenging due to abrupt load pattern changes and scarcity of extreme event samples.

Method: AdaCNP uses a shared embedding space to assess historical data relevance and reweights it for reliable predictions under extreme conditions, enabling adaptation to unseen scenarios with predictive distributions.

Result: AdaCNP reduced mean squared error by 22% compared to the strongest baseline and provided the most reliable probabilistic outputs, outperforming other methods on real-world data.

Conclusion: AdaCNP enhances the reliability of electricity load forecasting under extreme conditions, making power systems more resilient to disruptions caused by rare and abrupt regime shifts.

Abstract: Extreme weather can substantially change electricity consumption behavior, causing load curves to exhibit sharp spikes and pronounced volatility. If forecasts are inaccurate during those periods, power systems are more likely to face supply shortfalls or localized overloads, forcing emergency actions such as load shedding and increasing the risk of service disruptions and public-safety impacts. This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events.

*Doyeon Lee,Eunyi Lyou,Hyunsoo Cho,Sookyung Kim,Joonseok Lee,Jaemoo Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents QUATRO, a new RL algorithm to stabilize and improve LLM fine-tuning by enforcing principled trust-region constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GRPO-style RL-based fine-tuning algorithms for LLMs have optimization challenges, as their heuristic trust-region mechanisms fail to properly handle outlier samples, leading to brittle and unstable training.

Method: The paper introduces QUATRO, which enforces trust-region constraints through principled optimization, ensuring stability with clear objectives and entropy control. This replaces heuristic approximations with an exact trust-region formulation.

Result: QUATRO exhibits stable training performance on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, even under challenging conditions like policy staleness and high learning rates, maintaining controlled entropy.

Conclusion: QUATRO provides a solid and interpretable advancement to stabilize RL-based LLM fine-tuning while improving training reliability and robustness in challenging settings.

Abstract: GRPO-style reinforcement learning (RL)-based LLM fine-tuning algorithms have recently gained popularity. Relying on heuristic trust-region approximations, however, they can lead to brittle optimization behavior, as global importance-ratio clipping and group-wise normalization fail to regulate samples whose importance ratios fall outside the clipping range. We propose Query-Adaptive Trust-Region policy Optimization (QUATRO), which directly enforces trust-region constraints through a principled optimization. This yields a clear and interpretable objective that enables explicit control over policy updates and stable, entropy-controlled optimization, with a stabilizer terms arising intrinsically from the exact trust-region formulation. Empirically verified on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, QUATRO shows stable training under increased policy staleness and aggressive learning rates, maintaining well-controlled entropy throughout training.

*Sisi Yuan,Jiehuang Chen,Junchuang Cai,Dong Xu,Xueliang Li,Zexuan Zhu,Junkai Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIGA-Fold, a novel framework for protein inverse folding that addresses long-range dependency and error accumulation issues of existing methods, achieving notable improvements in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to overcome the limitations of current protein inverse folding methods, such as restricted receptive fields and error accumulation, and to improve accuracy in designing amino acid sequences for desired structures.

Method: The proposed RIGA-Fold employs a Geometric Attention Update module for local SE(3)-invariant encoding and an attention-based Global Context Bridge for incorporating global topological information. An enhanced version, RIGA-Fold*, integrates trainable geometric features with evolutionary priors and uses a predict-recycle-refine strategy for iterative error reduction.

Result: Extensive experiments on significant benchmarks (CATH 4.2, TS50, and TS500) reveal that RIGA-Fold is highly competitive, and RIGA-Fold* surpasses existing methods in sequence recovery and structure consistency.

Conclusion: RIGA-Fold and its enhanced version represent a significant advancement in protein inverse folding by addressing key bottlenecks and demonstrating superior performance in extensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Protein inverse folding, the task of predicting amino acid sequences for desired structures, is pivotal for de novo protein design. However, existing GNN-based methods typically suffer from restricted receptive fields that miss long-range dependencies and a "single-pass" inference paradigm that leads to error accumulation. To address these bottlenecks, we propose RIGA-Fold, a framework that synergizes Recurrent Interaction with Geometric Awareness. At the micro-level, we introduce a Geometric Attention Update (GAU) module where edge features explicitly serve as attention keys, ensuring strictly SE(3)-invariant local encoding. At the macro-level, we design an attention-based Global Context Bridge that acts as a soft gating mechanism to dynamically inject global topological information. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between structural and sequence modalities, we introduce an enhanced variant, RIGA-Fold*, which integrates trainable geometric features with frozen evolutionary priors from ESM-2 and ESM-IF via a dual-stream architecture. Finally, a biologically inspired ``predict-recycle-refine'' strategy is implemented to iteratively denoise sequence distributions. Extensive experiments on CATH 4.2, TS50, and TS500 benchmarks demonstrate that our geometric framework is highly competitive, while RIGA-Fold* significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both sequence recovery and structural consistency.

*Moritz Miller,Florent Draye,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to enhance interpretability and modularity in language model features by applying an orthogonality penalty during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of interference and superposition in feature representations by disentangling the decoder matrix into more interpretable and independent components.

Method: The authors propose an orthogonality penalty in fine-tuning language models around a sparse autoencoder, which ensures identifiable and modular feature representations.

Result: They demonstrate that stricter orthogonality increases the distance between feature explanations, promoting superior interpretability and enabling isolated interventions in representations.

Conclusion: Applying orthogonality in representations aligns with the Independent Causal Mechanisms principle, leading to features that better support causal understanding and intervention while maintaining performance.

Abstract: With recent progress on fine-tuning language models around a fixed sparse autoencoder, we disentangle the decoder matrix into almost orthogonal features. This reduces interference and superposition between the features, while keeping performance on the target dataset essentially unchanged. Our orthogonality penalty leads to identifiable features, ensuring the uniqueness of the decomposition. Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability. Invoking the $\textit{Independent Causal Mechanisms}$ principle, we argue that orthogonality promotes modular representations amenable to causal intervention. We empirically show that these increasingly orthogonalized features allow for isolated interventions. Our code is available under $\texttt{https://github.com/mrtzmllr/sae-icm}$.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture to resolve common issues in anomaly detection for multivariate time series, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance anomaly prediction in multivariate time series, addressing challenges like representation collapse and failure to detect precursor signals accurately.

Method: MTS-JEPA employs a multi-resolution predictive objective combined with a soft codebook bottleneck, separating transient shocks from long-term trends and capturing regime transitions.

Result: The architecture successfully avoids representation collapse, stabilizes optimization, and demonstrates superior performance on standard benchmarks for early-warning anomalies.

Conclusion: MTS-JEPA is a robust solution for modeling latent dynamics in critical infrastructures, tackling key limitations of prior approaches and offering state-of-the-art outcomes.

Abstract: Multivariate time series underpin modern critical infrastructure, making the prediction of anomalies a vital necessity for proactive risk mitigation. While Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a promising framework for modeling the latent evolution of these systems, their application is hindered by representation collapse and an inability to capture precursor signals across varying temporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture that integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck. This design explicitly decouples transient shocks from long-term trends, and utilizes the codebook to capture discrete regime transitions. Notably, we find this constraint also acts as an intrinsic regularizer to ensure optimization stability. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our approach effectively prevents degenerate solutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance under the early-warning protocol.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, MDF, to predict unintended behaviors in LLMs before fine-tuning, reducing costs and revealing biases in training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting and addressing biases in LLMs before the resource-intensive fine-tuning process is crucial, as current approaches are inefficient and costly.

Method: The authors present MDF, which summarizes data through mean representations and injects latent statistical signals into the model forward pass without parameter updates, predicting potential biases with reduced computational resources.

Result: MDF successfully predicts unintended behaviors in LLMs using significantly less GPU resources compared to fine-tuning, confirmed via experiments on multiple models.

Conclusion: MDF proves to be an efficient solution for early prediction of biases and safety risks in pre-training data, enabling proactive mitigations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE, a new RLHF algorithm, outperforms PPO with better reward stability, KL control, and minimal computation overhead for aligning language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address PPO's limitations like reward oscillations, entropy collapse, and unstable policy divergence in RLHF settings.

Method: SAFE uses a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation, entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds for stabilization.

Result: SAFE exceeds PPO in training by +5.15% average reward, avoids reward crashes, has superior KL control, and fits well for production deployment.

Conclusion: SAFE is a stable, interpretable, and efficient alternative to PPO for RLHF, demonstrating better long-term optimization and usability.

Abstract: Optimization (PPO) has been positioned by recent literature as the canonical method for the RL part of RLHF. PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) design factors for diffusion models, emphasizing the importance of employing ELBO-based likelihood estimation for stable and efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in applying RL to diffusion models due to intractable likelihoods and lack of systematic study on how likelihood estimators impact algorithm performance.

Method: The authors disentangle three RL design elements—policy-gradient objectives, likelihood estimators, and rollout sampling strategies—and systematically evaluate their impact. They focus on ELBO-based estimators for likelihood.

Result: The method improves GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, outperforming FlowGRPO by 4.6x and DiffusionNFT by 2x in efficiency without using reward hacking.

Conclusion: Adopting ELBO-based likelihood estimators is crucial for effective and efficient RL in diffusion models, outweighing the choice of policy-gradient loss forms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to diffusion and flow models for visual tasks such as text-to-image generation. However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSBoG, a scalable framework for generating efficient graph-transport policies that respect topology, optimize costs, and handle arbitrary graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-transport methods are limited by restrictive assumptions, poor generalization in sparse graphs, and scalability challenges. Hence, a more expressive and efficient framework is required.

Method: Proposes GSBoG, which learns controlled CTMC policies for graphs using likelihood optimization that satisfies endpoint marginals and optimizes intermediate state-dependent costs. This avoids the complexity of dense solvers.

Result: GSBoG demonstrates accurate policy learning on real-world graph scenarios, respects topology constraints, and optimizes intermediate costs effectively.

Conclusion: GSBoG is a robust solution for scalable, cost-aware, and topology-constrained transportation on diverse graph structures, enabling practical advancements in graph-based transport challenges.

Abstract: Transportation on graphs is a fundamental challenge across many domains, where decisions must respect topological and operational constraints. Despite the need for actionable policies, existing graph-transport methods lack this expressivity. They rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to generalize across sparse topologies, and scale poorly with graph size and time horizon. To address these issues, we introduce Generalized Schrödinger Bridge on Graphs (GSBoG), a novel scalable data-driven framework for learning executable controlled continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) policies on arbitrary graphs under state cost augmented dynamics. Notably, GSBoG learns trajectory-level policies, avoiding dense global solvers and thereby enhancing scalability. This is achieved via a likelihood optimization approach, satisfying the endpoint marginals, while simultaneously optimizing intermediate behavior under state-dependent running costs. Extensive experimentation on challenging real-world graph topologies shows that GSBoG reliably learns accurate, topology-respecting policies while optimizing application-specific intermediate state costs, highlighting its broad applicability and paving new avenues for cost-aware dynamical transport on general graphs.

TL;DR: REDistill is a KD framework that reduces reliance on noisy teacher predictions by replacing KL divergence with a robust power divergence loss, improving student model accuracy across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of noisy and overconfident teacher predictions in Knowledge Distillation (KD) and the limitations of existing heuristics-based correction methods.

Method: The authors propose REDistill, which employs a power divergence loss instead of KL divergence to downweight unreliable teacher outputs while maintaining informative logits.

Result: REDistill improves student model accuracy across diverse teacher-student architectures on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning.

Conclusion: REDistill is a robust, principled, and computationally efficient framework that generalizes well, making it suitable for real-world KD scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student by aligning their predictive distributions. However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets. In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures. Remarkably, it achieves these gains without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning, underscoring its robustness and strong generalization to unseen teacher-student pairs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the inefficiency of PPO in RL-based LLM fine-tuning and proposes DPPO, a more stable and efficient alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in PPO's ratio clipping mechanism for large vocabularies in LLMs, which leads to instability and training inefficiency.

Method: Introduced DPPO, which replaces PPO's heuristic clipping with direct policy divergence constraints (e.g., Total Variation or KL), using memory-efficient Binary and Top-K approximations.

Result: DPPO demonstrated superior training stability and efficiency in empirical evaluations compared to PPO and other methods.

Conclusion: DPPO offers a robust alternative to PPO, improving RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs by addressing the inefficiencies caused by PPO's ratio clipping mechanism.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.

*Zhen Zhou,Zhirui Wang,Qi Hong,Yunyang Shi,Ziyuan Gu,Zhiyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two frameworks for time series forecasting (Multi-Expert LDL and Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE) to achieve accurate predictions with interpretable uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world forecasting requires both high accuracy and interpretability, which traditional and existing approaches struggle to balance.

Method: The proposed Multi-Expert LDL framework uses mixture-of-experts architectures for distributional learning, including methods to capture diverse temporal patterns and decomposing time series into interpretable components.

Result: The methods achieve superior performance over baselines on M5 dataset sales data, with one method excelling in overall forecasting performance and the other in interpretability.

Conclusion: These frameworks effectively balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering actionable insights suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Time series forecasting in real-world applications requires both high predictive accuracy and interpretable uncertainty quantification. Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our methods on aggregated sales data derived from the M5 dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches. The continuous Multi-Expert LDL achieves the best overall performance, while the Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE provides enhanced interpretability through component-wise analysis. Our frameworks successfully balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting applications where both performance and actionable insights are crucial.

*Mahima Lakra,Ronan Fablet,Lucas Drumetz,Etienne Pauthenet,Elodie Martinez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses deep learning models, specifically UNet, to predict global phytoplankton biomass distributions, demonstrating promise for short-term forecasting and marine management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in simulating phytoplankton dynamics, which are crucial for marine ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles, using sparse observational data and complex oceanic variables.

Method: The authors tested different deep learning models (UNet, CNNs, ConvLSTM, 4CastNet) with satellite and environmental data to predict phytoplankton biomass, enhancing predictions by implementing an auto-regressive UNet for temporal forecasting.

Result: UNet outperformed other models in predicting seasonal and interannual patterns of phytoplankton biomass but showed limitations in capturing low-frequency changes. An autoregressive version improved short-term forecasting up to five months.

Conclusion: Deep learning, particularly UNet, holds promise in reconstructing and predicting phytoplankton dynamics, suggesting its potential as a tool for monitoring ocean health and marine ecosystem management under climate change impacts.

Abstract: Phytoplankton is the basis of marine food webs, driving both ecological processes and global biogeochemical cycles. Despite their ecological and climatic significance, accurately simulating phytoplankton dynamics remains a major challenge for biogeochemical numerical models due to limited parameterizations, sparse observational data, and the complexity of oceanic processes. Here, we explore how deep learning models can be used to address these limitations predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the global ocean based on satellite observations and environmental conditions. First, we investigate several deep learning architectures. Among the tested models, the UNet architecture stands out for its ability to reproduce the seasonal and interannual patterns of phytoplankton biomass more accurately than other models like CNNs, ConvLSTM, and 4CastNet. When using one to two months of environmental data as input, UNet performs better, although it tends to underestimate the amplitude of low-frequency changes in phytoplankton biomass. Thus, to improve predictions over time, an auto-regressive version of UNet was also tested, where the model uses its own previous predictions to forecast future conditions. This approach works well for short-term forecasts (up to five months), though its performance decreases for longer time scales. Overall, our study shows that combining ocean physical predictors with deep learning allows for reconstruction and short-term prediction of phytoplankton dynamics. These models could become powerful tools for monitoring ocean health and supporting marine ecosystem management, especially in the context of climate change.

### [302] [Towards Understanding and Avoiding Limitations of Convolutions on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04709)
*Andreas Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores theoretical limitations of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), identifies rank collapse issues, and proposes new frameworks to overcome these shortcomings, including multi-relational split (MRS) and MIMO-GC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited real-world impact of MPNNs by analyzing their theoretical underpinnings and clarifying key limitations that hinder performance.

Method: The authors identify two problems in MPNNs (shared component amplification and component dominance) and propose solutions such as using multiple computational graphs through the multi-relational split (MRS) framework and introducing spectral graph convolution (MIMO-GC). They also adapt MPNNs to preserve initial features by connecting them with the PageRank algorithm.

Result: The study introduces deeper insights into MPNN limitations and proposes practical frameworks (MRS, MIMO-GC, LMGC) that enhance their functionality and performance.

Conclusion: The paper broadens the theoretical understanding of MPNNs by identifying and addressing key limitations, offering practical solutions to improve their applicability and effectiveness.

Abstract: While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown promising results, their real-world impact remains limited. Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm. Based on personalized PageRank, we propose a variant of MPNNs that allows for infinitely many message-passing iterations, while preserving initial node features. Collectively, these results deepen the theoretical understanding of MPNNs.

*Luca Stradiotti,Laurens Devos,Anna Monreale,Jesse Davis,Andrea Pugnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-horizon time-series forecasting, introduces learning with abstention adapted for this domain, proposes various abstention strategies, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misaligned predictions in multi-horizon forecasting can have high costs in domains such as healthcare and finance; this paper aims to reduce these risks by incorporating abstention strategies tailored for structured sequences.

Method: The paper formalizes abstention for multi-horizon forecasting, defines three abstention strategies, and develops theoretical solutions with algorithms to implement them.

Result: Extensive evaluations on 24 datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms surpass existing baseline methods significantly.

Conclusion: Learning with abstention for structured predictions in multi-horizon forecasting shows superior reliability and performance, addressing key risks in critical applications.

Abstract: Multi-horizon time-series forecasting involves simultaneously making predictions for a consecutive sequence of subsequent time steps. This task arises in many application domains, such as healthcare and finance, where mispredictions can have a high cost and reduce trust. The learning with abstention framework tackles these problems by allowing a model to abstain from offering a prediction when it is at an elevated risk of making a misprediction. Unfortunately, existing abstention strategies are ill-suited for the multi-horizon setting: they target problems where a model offers a single prediction for each instance. Hence, they ignore the structured and correlated nature of the predictions offered by a multi-horizon forecaster. We formalize the problem of learning with abstention for multi-horizon forecasting setting and show that its structured nature admits a richer set of abstention problems. Concretely, we propose three natural notions of how a model could abstain for multi-horizon forecasting. We theoretically analyze each problem to derive the optimal abstention strategy and propose an algorithm that implements it. Extensive evaluation on 24 datasets shows that our proposed algorithms significantly outperforms existing baselines.

*Neville Mathew,Yidan Shen,Renjie Hu,Maham Rahimi,George Zouridakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses shortcomings in photoplethysmography (PPG)-based blood pressure estimation models, creating a standardized dataset and demonstrating that incorporating demographic information significantly improves model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cuffless blood pressure estimation via PPG signals is a promising approach for scalable cardiovascular health assessment. However, current models fail to meet clinical standards and lack rigorous evaluation under controlled conditions.

Method: The authors created NBPDB, a physiologically controlled benchmarking subset, derived from MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets. They tested existing PPG-based models and improved them by incorporating demographic data such as age, sex, and BMI.

Result: Initial evaluations showed none of the models met clinical accuracy standards (AAMI/ISO 81060-2). Modified models incorporating demographic data showed improved performance, with the MInception model achieving near-standard accuracy.

Conclusion: Existing PPG-based models are not clinically practical under standardized conditions. However, adding demographic data significantly enhances their accuracy and applicability in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Cuffless blood pressure screening based on easily acquired photoplethysmography (PPG) signals offers a practical pathway toward scalable cardiovascular health assessment. Despite rapid progress, existing PPG-based blood pressure estimation models have not consistently achieved the established clinical numerical limits such as AAMI/ISO 81060-2, and prior evaluations often lack the rigorous experimental controls necessary for valid clinical assessment. Moreover, the publicly available datasets commonly used are heterogeneous and lack physiologically controlled conditions for fair benchmarking. To enable fair benchmarking under physiologically controlled conditions, we created a standardized benchmarking subset NBPDB comprising 101,453 high-quality PPG segments from 1,103 healthy adults, derived from MIMIC-III and VitalDB. Using this dataset, we systematically benchmarked several state-of-the-art PPG-based models. The results showed that none of the evaluated models met the AAMI/ISO 81060-2 accuracy requirements (mean error $<$ 5 mmHg and standard deviation $<$ 8 mmHg). To improve model accuracy, we modified these models and added patient demographic data such as age, sex, and body mass index as additional inputs. Our modifications consistently improved performance across all models. In particular, the MInception model reduced error by 23\% after adding the demographic data and yielded mean absolute errors of 4.75 mmHg (SBP) and 2.90 mmHg (DBP), achieves accuracy comparable to the numerical limits defined by AAMI/ISO accuracy standards. Our results show that existing PPG-based BP estimation models lack clinical practicality under standardized conditions, while incorporating demographic information markedly improves their accuracy and physiological validity.

*Liming Wu,Rui Jiao,Qi Li,Mingze Li,Songyou Li,Shifeng Jin,Wenbing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMFlow introduces a generative framework for designing disordered crystals, leveraging advanced techniques for unified representation and structure generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep generative models overlook disordered materials, despite their critical importance in technological advancements.

Method: DMFlow utilizes a novel flow matching model with Riemannian flow and spherical reparameterization, learning through a Graph Neural Network tailored for physical symmetries, followed by a two-stage discretization for atomic assignments.

Result: DMFlow surpasses state-of-the-art methods in tasks like Crystal Structure Prediction and De Novo Generation, validated on a benchmark of curated disordered structures.

Conclusion: DMFlow lays the groundwork for AI-augmented discovery and generation of disordered materials, bridging gaps in conventional generative models.

Abstract: The design of materials with tailored properties is crucial for technological progress. However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.

*Kejiang Qian,Amos Storkey,Fengxiang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces rationality measures for reinforcement learning agents that evaluate their decision-making efficacy, proposes theoretical decompositions of rationality gaps, and establishes bounds and practical hypotheses supported by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical yet underexplored issue of evaluating and enhancing rationality in reinforcement learning agents.

Method: The authors define rationality measures including expected rational risk, rational risk gap, and its components using theoretical bounds such as $1$-Wasserstein distance and empirical Rademacher complexity. They also connect these to practical hypotheses and validate them experimentally.

Result: The study confirms theoretical expectations through extensive experiments, demonstrating the effects of regularisers, domain randomisation, and environment shifts on agent rationality.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning agents' rationality can be theoretically assessed and improved using proposed measures and hypotheses, verified experimentally, offering valuable insights into training and deployment challenges.

Abstract: This paper proposes a suite of rationality measures and associated theory for reinforcement learning agents, a property increasingly critical yet rarely explored. We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses. The code is available at https://github.com/EVIEHub/Rationality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to understand why attention heads in Transformers focus on certain tokens by analyzing the query-key (QK) space in a novel, interpretable way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind a Transformer's attention heads and why they attend to specific tokens is crucial, yet existing tools provide limited insights.

Method: The authors study the bilinear query-key (QK) space using a contrastive covariance method. They decompose the QK space into low-rank, interpretable components and analyze these components in both simplified and large language model settings.

Result: The method successfully identifies human-interpretable QK subspaces for categorical semantic and binding features, enabling attribution of attention scores to specific features.

Conclusion: This approach enhances our understanding of Transformer attention mechanisms by providing interpretable insights into the QK space, which could improve future model analysis and development.

Abstract: Despite the central role of attention heads in Transformers, we lack tools to understand why a model attends to a particular token. To address this, we study the query-key (QK) space -- the bilinear joint embedding space between queries and keys. We present a contrastive covariance method to decompose the QK space into low-rank, human-interpretable components. It is when features in keys and queries align in these low-rank subspaces that high attention scores are produced. We first study our method both analytically and empirically in a simplified setting. We then apply our method to large language models to identify human-interpretable QK subspaces for categorical semantic features and binding features. Finally, we demonstrate how attention scores can be attributed to our identified features.

*Yuchen Ye,Zixuan Qi,Shixuan Li,Wei Qi,Yanpeng Cai,Chaoxia Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DDL-MSPMF, a TransUNet-based framework to enhance multi-source precipitation prediction, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating robust detection of extreme events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) such as heterogeneous biases, limited skill for extreme precipitation, and to enhance hydroclimatic monitoring.

Method: Developed a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) integrating six MSPs and ERA5 physical predictors. The first stage predicts precipitation probability, and the second fuses inputs to estimate daily precipitation.

Result: The DDL-MSPMF improves seasonal performance metrics (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day), effectively detects extreme precipitation events, and is validated in data-scarce regions like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

Conclusion: DDL-MSPMF provides a scalable, explainable, and robust framework for precipitation fusion and extreme-event evaluation, offering better seasonal accuracy and extreme-event sensitivity.

Abstract: Multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) from satellite retrievals and reanalysis are widely used for hydroclimatic monitoring, yet spatially heterogeneous biases and limited skill for extremes still constrain their hydrologic utility. Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physical predictors. A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions. SHAP analysis highlights the importance of precipitation occurrence probabilities and surface pressure, providing physically interpretable diagnostics. The proposed framework offers a scalable and explainable approach for precipitation fusion and extreme-event assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in iterative generative modeling by proposing a method that enables high-quality one-step inference.

Method: The authors propose Drifting Models that use a drifting field to evolve the pushforward distribution during training, achieving equilibrium when the distribution matches the data.

Result: The one-step generator achieved state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution, with FID scores of 1.54 (latent space) and 1.61 (pixel space).

Conclusion: Drifting Models provide a novel and effective approach to generative modeling, enabling new possibilities for one-step high-quality generation.

Abstract: Generative modeling can be formulated as learning a mapping f such that its pushforward distribution matches the data distribution. The pushforward behavior can be carried out iteratively at inference time, for example in diffusion and flow-based models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Drifting Models, which evolve the pushforward distribution during training and naturally admit one-step inference. We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space. We hope that our work opens up new opportunities for high-quality one-step generation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces A2MAML, a new method for uncertainty-aware collaboration in multi-agent systems using multimodal sensors. It improves accident detection rates by up to 18.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing multi-agent systems that assume homogeneous sensing and lack explicit mechanisms to handle modality-specific, agent-dependent uncertainty.

Method: The paper presents A2MAML, which models sensor modalities as stochastic estimates with uncertainty prediction. It actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs and uses Bayesian inverse-variance weighting for information aggregation.

Result: A2MAML significantly outperforms both single-agent and collaborative baselines in collaborative accident detection scenarios, achieving up to 18.7% better detection rates.

Conclusion: A2MAML enables fine-grained, uncertainty-aware collaboration in multi-agent systems, demonstrating robustness under sensor corruption and improving collaborative decision-making.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly equipped with heterogeneous multimodal sensors, enabling richer perception but introducing modality-specific and agent-dependent uncertainty. Existing multi-agent collaboration frameworks typically reason at the agent level, assume homogeneous sensing, and handle uncertainty implicitly, limiting robustness under sensor corruption. We propose Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty (A2MAML), a principled approach for uncertainty-aware, modality-level collaboration. A2MAML models each modality-specific feature as a stochastic estimate with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting. This formulation enables fine-grained, modality-level fusion, supports asymmetric modality availability, and provides a principled mechanism to suppress corrupted or noisy modalities. Extensive experiments on connected autonomous driving scenarios for collaborative accident detection demonstrate that A2MAML consistently outperforms both single-agent and collaborative baselines, achieving up to 18.7% higher accident detection rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in applying large-scale pretraining and adaptation to general real-world graphs, leveraging the success of foundation models in language and vision.

Method: Proposed GraphBFF, a framework with the scalable GraphBFF Transformer architecture, providing techniques for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for billion-parameter GFMs.

Result: Demonstrated zero-shot and probing performance on diverse downstream graph tasks, with large gains (up to 31 PRAUC points) using a 1.4B-parameter GraphBFF Transformer.

Conclusion: GraphBFF sets a foundation for scalable graph learning, showcasing predictive performance and suggesting advancements for industrial-scale graph applications.

Abstract: Graph-structured data underpins many critical applications. While foundation models have transformed language and vision via large-scale pretraining and lightweight adaptation, extending this paradigm to general, real-world graphs is challenging. In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open opportunities for making GFMs a practical and principled foundation for graph learning at industrial scale.

*Yan Chen,Jie Peng,Moajjem Hossain Chowdhury,Tianlong Chen,Yunmei Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroCanvas, a novel framework for efficient seizure detection from EEG by addressing challenges of multi-channel heterogeneity and computational inefficiency through entropy-guided channel selection and visual encoding of signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of seizure detection from EEG data which is currently labor-intensive and computationally demanding.

Method: The proposed framework, NeuroCanvas, includes two key modules: an Entropy-guided Channel Selector for choosing seizure-relevant EEG channels, and a Canvas of Neuron Signal that visually encodes multi-channel signals into compact representations for LLMs.

Result: NeuroCanvas achieves a 20% improvement in F1 score and an 88% reduction in inference latency across multiple seizure detection datasets.

Conclusion: NeuroCanvas is a scalable, resource-efficient framework making real-time seizure detection more effective and practical for clinical application.

Abstract: Accurate and timely seizure detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) is critical for clinical intervention, yet manual review of long-term recordings is labor-intensive. Recent efforts to encode EEG signals into large language models (LLMs) show promise in handling neural signals across diverse patients, but two significant challenges remain: (1) multi-channel heterogeneity, as seizure-relevant information varies substantially across EEG channels, and (2) computing inefficiency, as the EEG signals need to be encoded into a massive number of tokens for the prediction. To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of $20\%$ in F1 score and reductions of $88\%$ in inference latency. These results highlight NeuroCanvas as a scalable and effective solution for real-time and resource-efficient seizure detection in clinical practice.The code will be released at https://github.com/Yanchen30247/seizure_detect.

### [313] [Interval-Based AUC (iAUC): Extending ROC Analysis to Uncertainty-Aware Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04775)
*Yuqi Li,Matthew M. Engelhard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-aware ROC framework for interval-valued predictions in risk prediction, focusing on quantifying uncertainty and improving decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of standard evaluation tools like ROC and AUC that fail to handle predictive uncertainty in interval-valued predictions for risk prediction.

Method: A novel ROC framework is proposed with two new metrics ($AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$), allowing models to abstain from uncertain rankings and providing lower/upper bounds for optimal AUC.

Result: The framework was validated on real-world datasets, showing its ability to handle uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the reliability and performance of interval-valued prediction models, offering practical solutions for uncertainty quantification and selective prediction.

Abstract: In high-stakes risk prediction, quantifying uncertainty through interval-valued predictions is essential for reliable decision-making. However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, using bootstrap-based intervals as one instantiation, validate the framework's correctness and demonstrate its practical utility for uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making.

*Emil Albrychiewicz,Andrés Franco Valiente,Li-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical framework to explain multimodal generation in coupled diffusion models, revealing synchronization gaps during reverse processes and proposing coupling strength as a key factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding around multimodal generation in diffusion models, which have shown high fidelity in synthesizing data.

Method: Using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions and coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, the researchers explore interaction timescales and coupling strength effects.

Result: Theoretical predictions supported by experiments using MNIST datasets show synchronization gaps, bounds for coupling strength, and propose time-dependent coupling schedules as an alternative to guidance tuning.

Conclusion: A spectral hierarchy governs multimodal generation, and coupling strength can be tuned temporally to improve generative stability, providing theoretical and experimental insights for future designs.

Abstract: Diffusion based generative models have achieved unprecedented fidelity in synthesizing high dimensional data, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing multimodal generation remain poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.

### [315] [Legendre Memory Unit with A Multi-Slice Compensation Model for Short-Term Wind Speed Forecasting Based on Wind Farm Cluster Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04782)
*Mumin Zhang,Haochen Zhang,Xin Zhi Khoo,Yilin Zhang,Nuo Chen,Ting Zhang,Junjie Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an accurate and robust wind speed prediction model for clustered wind farms using the spatial-temporal correlation of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance short-term wind speed prediction for clustered wind farms, ensuring smoother operation of power systems leveraging spatial-temporal correlations.

Method: The authors combined weighted mean filtering (WMF) for noise reduction and the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) with Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation (CPK) to develop the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). This is integrated into an ensemble model, WMF-CPK-MSLMU.

Result: The proposed WMF-CPK-MSLMU model demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing models in predicting short-term wind speeds.

Conclusion: The ensemble model effectively utilizes spatial-temporal correlations, denoising wind data, enhancing prediction stability, and compensating for spatial gaps, outperforming current methods in clustered wind farm management.

Abstract: With more wind farms clustered for integration, the short-term wind speed prediction of such wind farm clusters is critical for normal operation of power systems. This paper focuses on achieving accurate, fast, and robust wind speed prediction by full use of cluster data with spatial-temporal correlation. First, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is applied to denoise wind speed data at the single-farm level. The Legendre memory unit (LMU) is then innovatively applied for the wind speed prediction, in combination with the Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient (CPK) of wind farm cluster data, to construct the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). Finally, an innovative ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU is proposed herein, with three key blocks: data pre-processing, forecasting, and multi-slice compensation. Advantages include: 1) LMU jointly models linear and nonlinear dependencies among farms to capture spatial-temporal correlations through backpropagation; 2) MSLMU enhances forecasting by using CPK-derived weights instead of random initialization, allowing spatial correlations to fully activate hidden nodes across clustered wind farms.; 3) CPK adaptively weights the compensation model in MSLMU and complements missing data spatially, to facilitate the whole model highly accurate and robust. Test results on different wind farm clusters indicate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU in the short-term prediction of wind farm clusters compared to the existing models.

*Kieran A. Murphy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique to measure the information transmitted in vision transformers explicitly, using variational information bottlenecks, resulting in models with controllable information flow and enhanced interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to make the information flow in vision transformers explicit and measurable, addressing the need for precise control and better understanding of global visual representations derived from local patch processing.

Method: The authors insert variational information bottlenecks into all attention mechanisms in vision transformers, allowing for an explicit information cost and enabling a tunable spectrum between independent patch processing and global attention.

Result: On ImageNet-100, the models trained with this approach demonstrated a clear evolution in classification behavior and information routing. The analysis offers insights into how global visual information emerges and allows for constrained internal communication models.

Conclusion: This method improves the tractability and control of vision transformer models while providing new understanding of their behavior and information transmission dynamics.

Abstract: We make the information transmitted by attention an explicit, measurable quantity in vision transformers. By inserting variational information bottlenecks on all attention-mediated writes to the residual stream -- without other architectural changes -- we train models with an explicit information cost and obtain a controllable spectrum from independent patch processing to fully expressive global attention. On ImageNet-100, we characterize how classification behavior and information routing evolve across this spectrum, and provide initial insights into how global visual representations emerge from local patch processing by analyzing the first attention heads that transmit information. By biasing learning toward solutions with constrained internal communication, our approach yields models that are more tractable for mechanistic analysis and more amenable to control.

*Congjing Zhang,Ryan Feng Lin,Ruoxuan Bao,Shuai Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework, Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), to generate high-quality synthetic tabular data using collaborative Large Language Models (LLMs) and a three-phase quality control pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues in tabular datasets like class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity due to the scarcity of data, which hampers real-world machine learning applications.

Method: The method involves conceptualizing tabular data generation as a manufacturing process where specialized LLMs generate data components based on domain knowledge. The generated data is then systematically evaluated by a three-stage quality control pipeline.

Result: Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets show that T$^2$ produces superior-quality tabular data compared to state-of-the-art methods and enhances downstream ML model performance.

Conclusion: T$^2$ demonstrates strong potential for overcoming data scarcity challenges by generating reliable synthetic tabular data, making it a valuable tool for applications where direct data collection is unfeasible.

Abstract: While tabular data is fundamental to many real-world machine learning (ML) applications, acquiring high-quality tabular data is usually labor-intensive and expensive. Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.

*Wolfgang Maass,Sabine Janzen,Prajvi Saxena,Sach Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a two-level learning framework called Afferent Learning, which uses Computational Afferent Traces (CATs) for adaptive risk signal generation to improve damage-avoidance learning in biomechanical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop internal adaptive signals (CATs) that mimic biological systems for efficient damage-avoidance learning, addressing the challenges in long-term biomechanical operations.

Method: The framework employs an evolutionary optimization outer loop to find effective afferent sensing architectures and a reinforcement learning inner loop for policy training based on these signals. Smoothness and bounded-noise theoretical guarantees are provided.

Result: Compared to hand-designed baselines, the CAT-based architectures demonstrated significant improvements, including 23% reduction in high-risk actions and better age-robust behavioral adaptations.

Conclusion: Afferent Learning formalizes afferent sensing as an inductive bias for efficient learning, achieving higher damage-avoidance efficiency in biomechanical systems. The results highlight the importance of CAT signals and architecture evolution for robust learning and adaptation.

Abstract: We introduce Afferent Learning, a framework that produces Computational Afferent Traces (CATs) as adaptive, internal risk signals for damage-avoidance learning. Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility.

*Elizabeth Bates,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effect of reward function structures (sparse vs. dense rewards) on deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous cyber defense agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by dense rewards, which can bias agents to suboptimal and risky strategies, and to explore whether sparse rewards can lead to better-behaved and more reliable cyber defenders.

Method: The authors conducted evaluations across different sparse and dense reward functions using two cyber gym environments, altering network sizes, applying policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms, and utilizing a novel ground truth evaluation approach to directly compare reward functions.

Result: Sparse rewards, when goal-aligned and frequently encountered, improve training reliability and lead to cyber defense agents with better goal alignment and safer policies, while avoiding reliance on costly defensive actions.

Conclusion: Sparse reward structures, under certain conditions, can outperform dense rewards in training effective and low-risk cyber defense agents without inducing bias or the need for engineered penalties.

Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.

Motivation: Enhance accuracy and transferability in large heterogeneous legal citation networks.

Method: Introduces edge dropout, feature concatenation, multilingual node features, and an asymmetric decoder.

Conclusion: Adaptations enhance robustness, generalization, and cross-system inductive transferability in legal citation prediction.

Abstract: Recent work has applied link prediction to large heterogeneous legal citation networks \new{with rich meta-features}. We find that this approach can be improved by including edge dropout and feature concatenation for the learning of more robust representations, which reduces error rates by up to 45%. We also propose an approach based on multilingual node features with an improved asymmetric decoder for compatibility, which allows us to generalize and extend the prediction to more, geographically and linguistically disjoint, data from New Zealand. Our adaptations also improve inductive transferability between these disjoint legal systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STREAM-RL is an integrated urban traffic management framework combining forecasting, anomaly detection, and safe policy learning with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for reliable methods in urban traffic management to predict future conditions, identify anomalies, and implement safe corrective actions.

Method: The framework introduces three algorithms: PU-GAT+ for adaptive forecasting, CRFN-BY for uncertainty modeling, and LyCon-WRL+ for safe reinforcement learning, all emphasizing calibrated uncertainty propagation.

Result: STREAM-RL achieves 91.4% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1%, improves safety rate to 95.2%, and performs inference in 23ms.

Conclusion: STREAM-RL represents a novel approach by integrating theoretical guarantees into each component of traffic management and demonstrates significant improvement in safety, reliability, and performance.

Abstract: Urban traffic management demands systems that simultaneously predict future conditions, detect anomalies, and take safe corrective actions -- all while providing reliability guarantees. We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guarantees; (2) CRFN-BY, a Conformal Residual Flow Network that models uncertainty-normalized residuals via normalizing flows with Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR control under arbitrary dependence; and (3) LyCon-WRL+, an Uncertainty-Guided Safe World-Model RL agent with Lyapunov stability certificates, certified Lipschitz bounds, and uncertainty-propagated imagination rollouts. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to propagate calibrated uncertainty from forecasting through anomaly detection to safe policy learning with end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Experiments on multiple real-world traffic trajectory data demonstrate that STREAM-RL achieves 91.4\% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1\% under verified dependence, and improves safety rate to 95.2\% compared to 69\% for standard PPO while achieving higher reward, with 23ms end-to-end inference latency.

*Philipp Nazari,T. Konstantin Rusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the underutilization of linear attention models due to their low-rank states and proposes a pruning framework to reduce state size while maintaining model efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and underexploitation in trained linear attention models caused by low-rank structures.

Method: A rank-revealing pruning framework, specifically designed for hardware efficiency, using adaptive strategies like QR decomposition to structurally reduce key and query matrices in linear attention.

Result: Empirical tests revealed that pruning 50% of query and key channels resulted in minimal performance degradation across various tasks and models.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning method enhances memory efficiency and speed for linear attention models while preserving their performance.

Abstract: Linear attention offers a computationally efficient yet expressive alternative to softmax attention. However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear attention, revealing that low effective rank can affect retrieval error by amplifying query noise. In addition to these theoretical insights, we conjecture that the low-rank states can be substantially reduced post-training with only minimal performance degradation, yielding faster and more memory-efficient models. To this end, we propose a novel hardware-aware approach that structurally prunes key and query matrices, reducing the state size while retaining compatibility with existing CUDA kernels. We adapt several existing pruning strategies to fit our framework and, building on our theoretical analysis, propose a novel structured pruning method based on a rank-revealing QR decomposition. Our empirical results, evaluated across models of varying sizes and on various downstream tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our state reduction framework. We highlight that our framework enables the removal of 50% of the query and key channels at only a marginal increase in perplexity.

*Ryan Liu,Eric Qu,Tobias Kreiman,Samuel M. Blau,Aditi S. Krishnapriyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT) as an efficient benchmark for evaluating Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs), addressing the issue of non-smooth potential energy surfaces (PES) that hinder simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the issue of MLIPs failing to reflect the smoothness of quantum potential energy surfaces, which leads to errors in simulations, and to replace computationally expensive traditional evaluations with more efficient metrics.

Method: The authors propose the BSCT, which assesses PES by controlled bond deformations to detect artifacts like discontinuities and spurious forces across equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. It correlates strongly with molecular dynamics stability and demonstrates model optimization using BSCT-based refinements.

Result: The paper demonstrates that BSCT enables systematic refinement of MLIPs, resulting in models with low regression error, stable molecular dynamics, and reliable atomistic property predictions at a reduced computational cost compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: BSCT serves as a validation metric and an iterative model design tool that highlights physical challenges in MLIPs, enhancing their development and performance while improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of continual reinforcement learning where agents must learn tasks sequentially without forgetting, using a realistic and extensible robotic benchmark.

Method: The researchers developed CRoSS using two robotic platforms for testing task sequences in object-pushing, line-following, and goal-reaching scenarios, incorporating a containerized setup for reproducibility.

Result: CRoSS proved effective in testing standard RL algorithms like DQN and policy gradient methods, showcasing its suitability as a consistent and scalable CRL benchmark.

Conclusion: CRoSS provides a valuable platform that enables controlled studies in continual reinforcement learning with realistic robotic simulations and ensures ease of reproducibility for researchers.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) requires agents to learn from a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired policies. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in training large language models, specifically focusing on reducing communication costs, load imbalances, and metadata exchanges in Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) training.

Method: The authors propose a new architecture, Multi-Head LatentMoE, combined with Head Parallel (HP), which achieves constant communication cost, load balance, and deterministic communication. Additionally, IO-aware routing is introduced for efficiency.

Result: The proposed method trains up to 1.61× faster than traditional MoE approaches while maintaining identical performance. At doubled granularity, it achieves better performance and remains 1.11× faster.

Conclusion: This new approach significantly enhances the accessibility of multi-billion-parameter model training by improving both efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models have transformed many applications but remain expensive to train. Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) addresses this through conditional computation, with Expert Parallel (EP) as the standard distributed training method. However, EP has three limitations: communication cost grows linearly with the number of activated experts $k$, load imbalance affects latency and memory usage, and data-dependent communication requires metadata exchange. We propose Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), a new architecture and parallelism achieving $O(1)$ communication cost regardless of $k$, completely balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, all while remaining compatible with EP. To accelerate Multi-Head LatentMoE, we propose IO-aware routing and expert computation. Compared to MoE with EP, Multi-Head LatentMoE with HP trains up to $1.61\times$ faster while having identical performance. With doubled granularity, it achieves higher overall performance while still being $1.11\times$ faster. Our method makes multi-billion-parameter foundation model research more accessible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to adapt learning models in IoT environments characterized by dynamic changes like sensor drift and evolving user behaviors. The paper aims to advance IoT applications by leveraging continual and contrastive learning while managing specific IoT challenges.

Method: The approach involves reviewing current advancements, unifying problem formulation, defining a blend of contrastive and distillation losses, proposing an IoT-oriented architecture for learning across various levels (on-device, edge, cloud), and providing evaluation protocols.

Result: This work synthesizes algorithmic design elements with IoT operational realities and identifies a CCL framework tailored for IoT. It also outlines challenges and pathways for dealing with diverse IoT-specific concerns, such as energy-efficient training, concept drift, and federated learning.

Conclusion: Contrastive continual learning in IoT can bring robustness, efficiency, and adaptive capabilities in nonstationary environments. However, addressing unique IoT challenges requires further research in data diversity, connectivity, and energy optimization.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) deployments operate in nonstationary, dynamic environments where factors such as sensor drift, evolving user behavior, and heterogeneous user privacy requirements can affect application utility. Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Protein Autoregressive Modeling (PAR), a novel multi-scale autoregressive approach for generating protein backbones via coarse-to-fine scales, offering strong structural generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an effective and scalable method for protein backbone generation that can capture the hierarchical and multi-scale properties of proteins while addressing exposure bias issues in traditional autoregressive models.

Method: The proposed PAR framework integrates multi-scale downsampling, an autoregressive transformer for encoding and guiding generation, and a flow-based backbone decoder, coupled with noisy context learning and scheduled sampling to mitigate exposure bias.

Result: PAR demonstrates strong performance in zero-shot generalization, high-quality unconditional protein backbone generation, and supports flexible conditional human-prompted and motif-guided generation.

Conclusion: PAR establishes itself as an effective framework for protein backbone generation by combining hierarchical modeling, exposure bias mitigation, and adaptability, laying the foundation for advanced protein structure design applications.

Abstract: We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.

*Haoran Yin,Shuaiqun Pan,Zhao Wei,Jian Cheng Wong,Yew-Soon Ong,Anna V. Kononova,Thomas Bäck,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining Genetic Programming and Large Language Models to discover efficient algorithms for real-world optimization problems without costly evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, automated algorithm design requires extensive evaluations, which are unfeasible for real-world tasks due to high computational costs.

Method: The framework integrates a Genetic Programming function generator with an LLM-powered evolutionary algorithm designer, focusing on proxy functions that mimic real-world problems to guide algorithm discovery.

Result: Validation across real-world problems revealed that the framework discovers high-performance algorithms while significantly reducing computational evaluations.

Conclusion: This framework provides an efficient way to apply LLM-based algorithm design to complex real-world optimization tasks with reduced computational demands.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in automated algorithm design, giving rise to numerous powerful methods. However, these approaches retain critical limitations: they require extensive evaluation of the target problem to guide the search process, making them impractical for real-world optimization tasks, where each evaluation consumes substantial computational resources. This research proposes an innovative and efficient framework that decouples algorithm discovery from high-cost evaluation. Our core innovation lies in combining a Genetic Programming (GP) function generator with an LLM-driven evolutionary algorithm designer. The evolutionary direction of the GP-based function generator is guided by the similarity between the landscape characteristics of generated proxy functions and those of real-world problems, ensuring that algorithms discovered via proxy functions exhibit comparable performance on real-world problems. Our method enables deep exploration of the algorithmic space before final validation while avoiding costly real-world evaluations. We validated the framework's efficacy across multiple real-world problems, demonstrating its ability to discover high-performance algorithms while substantially reducing expensive evaluations. This approach shows a path to apply LLM-based automated algorithm design to computationally intensive real-world optimization challenges.

*Yannik Stradmann,Johannes Schemmel,Mihai A. Petrovici,Laura Kriener*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for neuromorphic systems, using direct analog signal injection to avoid power-intensive signal conversions, showcased on the BrainScaleS-2 platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficient near-sensor processing by eliminating analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion overhead in neuromorphic systems.

Method: By utilizing the BrainScaleS-2 platform, direct injection of continuous analog sensor data is employed, paired with spiking neural network processing.

Result: The system demonstrates real-time capability for sound source localization and motor alignment directly through on-chip computation.

Conclusion: Direct analog signal handling enhances efficiency, enabling a fully integrated neuromorphic processing pipeline from sensory input to actuator control.

Abstract: Sensory processing with neuromorphic systems is typically done by using either event-based sensors or translating input signals to spikes before presenting them to the neuromorphic processor. Here, we offer an alternative approach: direct analog signal injection eliminates superfluous and power-intensive analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions, making it particularly suitable for efficient near-sensor processing. We demonstrate this by using the accelerated BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic research platform and interfacing it directly to microphones and a servo-motor-driven actuator. Utilizing BrainScaleS-2's 1000-fold acceleration factor, we employ a spiking neural network to transform interaural time differences into a spatial code and thereby predict the location of sound sources. Our primary contributions are the first demonstrations of direct, continuous-valued sensor data injection into the analog compute units of the BrainScaleS-2 ASIC, and actuator control using its embedded microprocessors. This enables a fully on-chip processing pipeline$\unicode{x2014}$from sensory input handling, via spiking neural network processing to physical action. We showcase this by programming the system to localize and align a servo motor with the spatial direction of transient noise peaks in real-time.

TL;DR: The paper presents an evolutionary, hardware-in-the-loop framework to efficiently map computational graphs to spatial accelerators, achieving notable reductions in latency and improvements in energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the challenge of mapping computational graphs to spatial accelerators, which typically requires expert knowledge and effort, hindering broader accessibility.

Method: The authors frame the mapping process as a black-box optimization problem and propose an evolutionary, hardware-in-the-loop framework to simplify deployment on spatial accelerators.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates up to 35% reduction in latency on Intel Loihi 2 and scales efficiently to multi-chip systems, with an observed up to 40% improvement in energy efficiency.

Conclusion: This approach enables users to deploy workloads on neuromorphic accelerators efficiently without requiring deep hardware expertise, achieving both reduced latency and improved energy efficiency.

Abstract: Spatial accelerators, composed of arrays of compute-memory integrated units, offer an attractive platform for deploying inference workloads with low latency and low energy consumption. However, fully exploiting their architectural advantages typically requires careful, expert-driven mapping of computational graphs to distributed processing elements. In this work, we automate this process by framing the mapping challenge as a black-box optimization problem. We introduce the first evolutionary, hardware-in-the-loop mapping framework for neuromorphic accelerators, enabling users without deep hardware knowledge to deploy workloads more efficiently. We evaluate our approach on Intel Loihi 2, a representative spatial accelerator featuring 152 cores per chip in a 2D mesh. Our method achieves up to 35% reduction in total latency compared to default heuristics on two sparse multi-layer perceptron networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to multi-chip systems and observe an up to 40% improvement in energy efficiency, without explicitly optimizing for it.

### [331] [Impact of diversity on bounded archives for multi-objective local search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04745)
*Amadeu A. Coco,Cyprien Borée,Julien Baste,Laetitia Jourdan,Lucien Mousin*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper tackles two challenges of Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOOPs): exponential growth of non-dominated solutions and imbalance in Pareto Front exploration, proposing new algorithms to improve solution diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges of handling a vast number of non-dominated solutions and ensuring balanced exploration of the Pareto Front in MOOPs.

Method: The study employs bounded archives to manage non-dominated solutions growth and introduces new methods focused on enhancing solution space diversity, including the Hamming Distance Archiving Algorithm.

Result: The proposed Hamming Distance Archiving Algorithm outperforms existing approaches like Adaptive Grid Archiving and Hypervolume Archiving in terms of multi-objective local search performance.

Conclusion: The research advances methodology in MOOP metaheuristics, offering effective mechanisms for managing non-dominated solutions and improving overall search diversity, particularly in the solution space.

Abstract: This work tackles two critical challenges related to the development of metaheuristics for Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOOPs): the exponential growth of non-dominated solutions and the tendency of metaheuristics to disproportionately concentrate their search on a subset of the Pareto Front. To counteract the first, bounded archives are employed as a strategic mechanism for effectively managing the increasing number of non-dominated solutions. Addressing the second challenge involves an in-depth exploration of solution diversity algorithms found in existing literature. Upon recognizing that current approaches predominantly center on diversity within the objective space, this research introduces innovative methods specifically designed to enhance diversity in the solution space. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the Hamming Distance Archiving Algorithm, one of the newly proposed algorithms for multi-objective local search, surpassing the performance of the Adaptive Grid Archiving and the Hypervolume Archiving, both drawn from the literature. This outcome suggests a promising avenue for enhancing the overall efficiency of metaheuristics employed for solving MOOPs.

### [332] [A-Graph: A Unified Graph Representation for At-Will Simulation across System Stacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04847)
*Daniel Price,Prabhu Vellaisamy,Patricia Gonzalez,George Michelogiannakis,John P. Shen,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agraph, a unified graph representation for system design across diverse technologies, architectures, and applications, along with Archx, a framework for flexible and efficient design space exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in complexity and diversity in computer system designs has made early-stage design space exploration more critical for achieving optimal performance and cost, but existing tools and methods have limitations in flexibility and domain requirements.

Method: The authors propose Agraph as a unified graph-based representation for system design and Archx as a framework to implement Agraph. Archx offers a user-friendly interface for automated design generation and evaluation, as well as granular metric retrieval for better analysis.

Result: Case studies demonstrate the generalization capability of Agraph across various technologies, architectures, and applications, achieving high simulation accuracy and flexibility.

Conclusion: Agraph and Archx provide a systematic approach for agile, accurate, and flexible design space exploration, significantly enhancing simulation capabilities for performance and cost optimization.

Abstract: As computer systems continue to diversify across technologies, architectures, applications, and beyond, the relevant design space has become larger and more complex. Given such trends, design space exploration (DSE) at early stages is critical to ensure agile development towards optimal performance and cost. Industry-grade EDA tools directly take in RTL code and report accurate results, but do not perform DSE. Recent works have attempted to explore the design space via simulation. However, most of these works are domain-specific and constrain the space that users are allowed to explore, offering limited flexibility between technologies, architecture, and applications. Moreover, they often demand high domain expertise to ensure high accuracy. To enable simulation that is agnostic to technology, architecture, and application at any granularity, we introduce Architecture-Graph (Agraph), a graph that unifies the system representation surrounding any arbitrary application, software, architecture, and circuit. Such a unified representation distinguishes Agraph from prior works, which focus on a single stack, allowing users to freely explore the design space across system stacks. To fully unleash the potential of Agraph, we further present Archx, a framework that implements Agraph. Archx is user-friendly in two ways. First, Archx has an easy-to-use programming interface to automatically generate and sweep design points under user constraints, boosting the programmability. Second, Archx adopts scope-based metric retrieval to analyze and understand each design point at any user-preferred hierarchy, enhancing the explainability. We conduct case studies that demonstrate Agraph's generalization across technologies, architecture, and applications with high simulation accuracy. Overall, we argue that Agraph and Archx serve as a foundation to simulate both performance and cost at will.

### [334] [How Users Understand Robot Foundation Model Performance through Task Success Rates and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03920)
*Isaac Sheidlower,Jindan Huang,James Staley,Bingyu Wu,Qicong Chen,Reuben Aronson,Elaine Short*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates how non-experts interpret performance data from Robot Foundation Models, focusing on task success rates and failure cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how non-roboticists comprehensively interpret performance metrics like task success rates and failure cases in RFMs, ensuring informed interactions with robots.

Method: Conducted a study using real evaluation data (task success rate, failure descriptions, and videos) from earlier published RFM research projects to gauge users' interpretation.

Result: Non-experts interpreted task success rate metrics in line with expert expectations and valued failure case information, which is rarely reported in typical evaluations.

Conclusion: Non-experts need both real evaluation data and predictive estimates on novel tasks to better understand the robot capabilities and related risks.

Abstract: Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) represent a promising approach to developing general-purpose home robots. Given the broad capabilities of RFMs, users will inevitably ask an RFM-based robot to perform tasks that the RFM was not trained or evaluated on. In these cases, it is crucial that users understand the risks associated with attempting novel tasks due to the relatively high cost of failure. Furthermore, an informed user who understands an RFM's capabilities will know what situations and tasks the robot can handle. In this paper, we study how non-roboticists interpret performance information from RFM evaluations. These evaluations typically report task success rate (TSR) as the primary performance metric. While TSR is intuitive to experts, it is necessary to validate whether novices also use this information as intended. Toward this end, we conducted a study in which users saw real evaluation data, including TSR, failure case descriptions, and videos from multiple published RFM research projects. The results highlight that non-experts not only use TSR in a manner consistent with expert expectations but also highly value other information types, such as failure cases that are not often reported in RFM evaluations. Furthermore, we find that users want access to both real data from previous evaluations of the RFM and estimates from the robot about how well it will do on a novel task.

### [335] [VLS: Steering Pretrained Robot Policies via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03973)
*Shuo Liu,Ishneet Sukhvinder Singh,Yiqing Xu,Jiafei Duan,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vision-Language Steering (VLS), enabling frozen generative robot policies to adapt at inference-time under test-time shifts without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained generative policies often fail under shifted spatial configurations or mild clutter, even though the needed motor skills exist, exposing the limitation of imitation learning during train-test shifts.

Method: VLS formulates adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering sampling using vision-language models to generate rewards and guide action trajectories without parameter modification.

Result: Across both simulated and real-world evaluations, VLS outperformed prior methods significantly, showing 31% improvement on CALVIN and 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO, with robust real-world adaptation on a Franka robot.

Conclusion: VLS offers a training-free solution for inference-time adaptation, effectively addressing spatial and semantic shifts without retraining, demonstrating reliable performance in varied contexts.

Abstract: Why do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on a shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.

### [336] [Efficient Long-Horizon Vision-Language-Action Models via Static-Dynamic Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03983)
*Weikang Qiu,Tinglin Huang,Aosong Feng,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SD-VLA to enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotics by optimizing visual input processing. It achieves better performance, faster inference, and introduces a new benchmark for evaluating long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models currently have limitations in handling long-horizon tasks effectively and suffer from inefficient inference due to complex attention mechanisms.

Method: The SD-VLA framework separates visual data into static and dynamic tokens, reducing redundancy and enabling efficient caching mechanisms for faster inference across multiple frames.

Result: SD-VLA improves benchmarks with a 39.8% higher success rate and 3.9% gain on SimplerEnv. It also achieves a 2.26x inference speedup in real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: SD-VLA addresses key challenges in VLA models, enhancing visual token management, inference speed, and task performance, while paving the way for practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.

*Hossein B. Jond,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Future Direction-Aware (FDA) flocking, a bio-inspired predictive framework for improved swarm coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance coordination in swarm robotics by incorporating anticipatory cues inspired by bird postural signals and multirotor attitude-based predictions.

Method: A predictive flocking model blending reactive alignment with short-term neighbor velocity predictions, regulated by a tunable parameter.

Result: FDA achieves better alignment, translational displacement, and robustness against delays and noise in simulations compared to reactive models.

Conclusion: FDA improves performance in swarm robotics, encouraging exploration of adaptive strategies and real-world validation.

Abstract: Understanding self-organization in natural collectives such as bird flocks inspires swarm robotics, yet most flocking models remain reactive, overlooking anticipatory cues that enhance coordination. Motivated by avian postural and wingbeat signals, as well as multirotor attitude tilts that precede directional changes, this work introduces a principled, bio-inspired anticipatory augmentation of reactive flocking termed Future Direction-Aware (FDA) flocking. In the proposed framework, agents blend reactive alignment with a predictive term based on short-term estimates of neighbors' future velocities, regulated by a tunable blending parameter that interpolates between reactive and anticipatory behaviors. This predictive structure enhances velocity consensus and cohesion-separation balance while mitigating the adverse effects of sensing and communication delays and measurement noise that destabilize reactive baselines. Simulation results demonstrate that FDA achieves faster and higher alignment, enhanced translational displacement of the flock, and improved robustness to delays and noise compared to a purely reactive model. Future work will investigate adaptive blending strategies, weighted prediction schemes, and experimental validation on multirotor drone swarms.

*Aabha Tamhankar,Jay Patil,Giovanni Pittiglio*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robotic system for autonomous shaping of endovascular guidewires, aiming to standardize a procedure currently dependent on surgeon expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To standardize and improve the complex manual process of shaping neuroendovascular guidewires, which depends heavily on surgical expertise and is challenging for intricate anatomies.

Method: The researchers created a robotic system and a shape-prediction model based on experimental data, capable of shaping guidewires autonomously into clinically relevant geometries, like C, S, and hook shapes.

Result: The robot shaped guidewires with high accuracy, achieving a shape prediction RMS error of 0.56mm in 2D validation tests and demonstrated 3D shaping and navigation capabilities in complex anatomical pathways.

Conclusion: The study confirms the feasibility of using a robotic system to autonomously shape guidewires, potentially standardizing these procedures and reducing reliance on surgeon expertise.

Abstract: Neuroendovascular access often relies on passive microwires that are hand-shaped at the back table and then used to track a microcatheter to the target. Neuroendovascular surgeons determine the shape of the wire by examining the patient pre-operative images and using their experience to identify anatomy specific shapes of the wire that would facilitate reaching the target. This procedure is particularly complex in convoluted anatomical structures and is heavily dependent on the level of expertise of the surgeon. Towards enabling standardized autonomous shaping, we present a bench-top guidewire shaping robot capable of producing navigation-specific desired wire configurations. We present a model that can map the desired wire shape into robot actions, calibrated using experimental data. We show that the robot can produce clinically common tip geometries (C, S, Angled, Hook) and validate them with respect to the model-predicted shapes in 2D. Our model predicts the shape with a Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 0.56mm across all shapes when compared to the experimental results. We also demonstrate 3D tip shaping capabilities and the ability to traverse complex endoluminal navigation from the petrous Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) to the Posterior Communicating Artery (PComm).

*Riming Xu,Obadah Wali,Yasmine Marani,Eric Feron*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a control and estimation framework for quadrotors operating in environments without GNSS and unreliable inertial sensors, using external position measurements and an EKF with Unknown Inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of quadrotor operation in GNSS-denied, non-inertial environments where conventional IMU sensors fail due to platform-induced accelerations.

Method: The authors propose an Extended Kalman Filter with Unknown Inputs (EKF-UI) paired with a cascaded PID controller for quadrotor control using external position measurements.

Result: Experimental results on a moving-cart testbed demonstrate improved stability and trajectory tracking, even in translational dissonance along the X and Y axes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances performance without requiring inertial feedback, facilitating deployment on moving platforms like trucks or elevators.

Abstract: We present a robust control and estimation framework for quadrotors operating in Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS)-denied, non-inertial environments where inertial sensors such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) become unreliable due to platform-induced accelerations. In such settings, conventional estimators fail to distinguish whether the measured accelerations arise from the quadrotor itself or from the non-inertial platform, leading to drift and control degradation. Unlike conventional approaches that depend heavily on IMU and GNSS, our method relies exclusively on external position measurements combined with a Extended Kalman Filter with Unknown Inputs (EKF-UI) to account for platform motion. The estimator is paired with a cascaded PID controller for full 3D tracking. To isolate estimator performance from localization errors, all tests are conducted using high-precision motion capture systems. Experimental results in a moving-cart testbed validate our approach under both translational in X-axis and Y-axis dissonance. Compared to standard EKF, the proposed method significantly improves stability and trajectory tracking without requiring inertial feedback, enabling practical deployment on moving platforms such as trucks or elevators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of manual ultrasonic sacral osteotomy, particularly in trajectory and depth accuracy.

Method: Designed a robotic system integrating an ultrasonic osteotome with a 7-DoF robotic manipulator and optical tracking, compared with manual results in controlled conditions.

Result: The robotic system demonstrated highly precise trajectory accuracy (0.11 mm RMSE vs. 1.10 mm RMSE for manual) and accurate depth control (8.1 mm vs. 16.0 mm for manual).

Conclusion: Robotic procedures can improve safety and precision in sacral resections, outperforming manual techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an autonomous Ultrasonic Sacral Osteotomy (USO) robotic system that integrates an ultrasonic osteotome with a seven-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic manipulator guided by an optical tracking system. To assess multi-directional control along both the surface trajectory and cutting depth of this system, we conducted quantitative comparisons between manual USO (MUSO) and robotic USO (RUSO) in Sawbones phantoms under identical osteotomy conditions. The RUSO system achieved sub-millimeter trajectory accuracy (0.11 mm RMSE), an order of magnitude improvement over MUSO (1.10 mm RMSE). Moreover, MUSO trials showed substantial over-penetration (16.0 mm achieved vs. 8.0 mm target), whereas the RUSO system maintained precise depth control (8.1 mm). These results demonstrate that robotic procedures can effectively overcome the critical limitations of manual osteotomy, establishing a foundation for safer and more precise sacral resections.

*Chak Lam Shek,Faizan M. Tariq,Sangjae Bae,David Isele,Piyush Gupta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces KGLAMP, a framework using knowledge graphs and LLMs for planning in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, addressing limitations of traditional and LLM-only planners in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current planning approaches for heterogeneous multi-robot systems fail to handle dynamic environments effectively due to manually created symbolic models or ignorance of heterogeneity and uncertainty.

Method: KGLAMP integrates a structured, dynamically updated knowledge graph to guide LLMs in generating PDDL problem specifications, ensuring adaptability and flexibility in planning.

Result: Experiments on the MAT-THOR benchmark show that KGLAMP achieves a performance improvement of at least 25.5% compared to LLM-only and PDDL-based approaches.

Conclusion: KGLAMP demonstrates the importance of integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs to improve planning accuracy, adaptability, and overall performance for multi-robot systems.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in long-horizon missions that require coordination among robots with diverse capabilities. However, existing planning approaches struggle to construct accurate symbolic representations and maintain plan consistency in dynamic environments. Classical PDDL planners require manually crafted symbolic models, while LLM-based planners often ignore agent heterogeneity and environmental uncertainty. We introduce KGLAMP, a knowledge-graph-guided LLM planning framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. The framework maintains a structured knowledge graph encoding object relations, spatial reachability, and robot capabilities, which guides the LLM in generating accurate PDDL problem specifications. The knowledge graph serves as a persistent, dynamically updated memory that incorporates new observations and triggers replanning upon detecting inconsistencies, enabling symbolic plans to adapt to evolving world states. Experiments on the MAT-THOR benchmark show that KGLAMP improves performance by at least 25.5% over both LLM-only and PDDL-based variants.

Motivation: To enable robots in shared human spaces to communicate and engage better by making their movements more expressive, beyond mere functionality.

Method: It introduces a hands-on interactive workshop with interdisciplinary guidance, leveraging frameworks from dance and providing tools like a manual remote controller and animation software for real-time manipulation and detailed motion design.

Result: The proposed toolbox allows participants to successfully create intuitive and engaging motions for robotic arms, bridging human intention and robotic expressiveness.

Conclusion: The methodology and tools presented enhance the capacity of engineers to design expressive robotic movements, improving interaction and communication in shared human-robot environments.

Abstract: As robots increasingly become part of shared human spaces, their movements must transcend basic functionality by incorporating expressive qualities to enhance engagement and communication. This paper introduces a movement-centered design pedagogy designed to support engineers in creating expressive robotic arm movements. Through a hands-on interactive workshop informed by interdisciplinary methodologies, participants explored various creative possibilities, generating valuable insights into expressive motion design. The iterative approach proposed integrates analytical frameworks from dance, enabling designers to examine motion through dynamic and embodied dimensions. A custom manual remote controller facilitates interactive, real-time manipulation of the robotic arm, while dedicated animation software supports visualization, detailed motion sequencing, and precise parameter control. Qualitative analysis of this interactive design process reveals that the proposed "toolbox" effectively bridges the gap between human intent and robotic expressiveness resulting in more intuitive and engaging expressive robotic arm movements.

Abstract: Current 3D scene graph generation (3DSGG) approaches heavily rely on a single-agent assumption and small-scale environments, exhibiting limited scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce Multi-Agent 3D Scene Graph Generation (MA3DSG) model, the first framework designed to tackle this scalability challenge using multiple agents. We develop a training-free graph alignment algorithm that efficiently merges partial query graphs from individual agents into a unified global scene graph. Leveraging extensive analysis and empirical insights, our approach enables conventional single-agent systems to operate collaboratively without requiring any learnable parameters. To rigorously evaluate 3DSGG performance, we propose MA3DSG-Bench-a benchmark that supports diverse agent configurations, domain sizes, and environmental conditions-providing a more general and extensible evaluation framework. This work lays a solid foundation for scalable, multi-agent 3DSGG research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the capability of robots in situated embodied conversations by improving their interaction through real-time dialogue and active perception.

Method: The approach combines real-time multimodal language models with tool interfaces focused on attention and active perception. Experiments were conducted in six scenarios with varying levels of perceptual requirements.

Result: Findings showed that combining multimodal language models with active perceptual tools led to promising results in tool-decision correctness and subjective interaction quality.

Conclusion: Real-time multimodal large language models and active perception tools present a promising solution for advancing situated embodied conversations in robots.

Abstract: Situated embodied conversation requires robots to interleave real-time dialogue with active perception: deciding what to look at, when to look, and what to say under tight latency constraints. We present a simple, minimal system recipe that pairs a real-time multimodal language model with a small set of tool interfaces for attention and active perception. We study six home-style scenarios that require frequent attention shifts and increasing perceptual scope. Across four system variants, we evaluate turn-level tool-decision correctness against human annotations and collect subjective ratings of interaction quality. Results indicate that real-time multimodal large language models and tool use for active perception is a promising direction for practical situated embodied conversation.

*Chengzhang Wang,Chao Chen,Jun Tao,Tengfei Liu,He Bai,Song Wang,Longfei Xu,Kaikui Liu,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces GenMRP, a generative framework for efficient and diverse multi-route planning in large-scale navigation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods struggle with personalization, route diversity, and real-time efficiency, creating a need for an approach that resolves these challenges.

Method: GenMRP introduces a skeleton-to-capillary approach to efficiently generate routes within relevant sub-networks. Routes are iteratively generated using a Link Cost Model and Dijkstra algorithm, balancing quality and diversity through a new correctional boosting method.

Result: GenMRP achieved state-of-the-art performance in offline and online tests, showcasing high efficiency and is fully deployed in a real-world navigation app.

Conclusion: GenMRP overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, addressing efficiency, diversity, and personalization in navigation route planning.

Abstract: Existing industrial-scale navigation applications contend with massive road networks, typically employing two main categories of approaches for route planning. The first relies on precomputed road costs for optimal routing and heuristic algorithms for generating alternatives, while the second, generative methods, has recently gained significant attention. However, the former struggles with personalization and route diversity, while the latter fails to meet the efficiency requirements of large-scale real-time scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GenMRP, a generative framework for multi-route planning. To ensure generation efficiency, GenMRP first introduces a skeleton-to-capillary approach that dynamically constructs a relevant sub-network significantly smaller than the full road network. Within this sub-network, routes are generated iteratively. The first iteration identifies the optimal route, while the subsequent ones generate alternatives that balance quality and diversity using the newly proposed correctional boosting approach. Each iteration incorporates road features, user historical sequences, and previously generated routes into a Link Cost Model to update road costs, followed by route generation using the Dijkstra algorithm. Extensive experiments show that GenMRP achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency in both offline and online environments. To facilitate further research, we have publicly released the training and evaluation dataset. GenMRP has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness and benefits.

*Hyeonbeom Choi,Daechul Ahn,Youhan Lee,Taewook Kang,Seongwon Cho,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCALE introduces a new method for robotic control combining visual perception modulation and action adaptation, improving efficiency and robustness without additional training requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models face limitations during deployment due to their reliance on complex test-time scaling strategies and fixed visual representations under perceptual ambiguity.

Method: SCALE employs an uncertainty-driven exploration approach inspired by Active Inference theory to adjust both visual perception and actions during inference without requiring extra training, verifiers, or multiple processing steps.

Result: Experiments demonstrated SCALE's ability to enhance VLA performance in both simulated and real-world environments, surpassing existing test-time scaling methods while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: SCALE provides a practical and effective strategy for robotic control by enabling adaptive visual and action processing, addressing perceptual ambiguities and improving robustness in varying conditions.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic control, with test-time scaling (TTS) gaining attention to enhance robustness beyond training. However, existing TTS methods for VLAs require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, making them impractical for deployment. Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass. SCALE broadens exploration in both perception and action under high uncertainty, while focusing on exploitation when confident-enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SCALE improves state-of-the-art VLAs and outperforms existing TTS methods while maintaining single-pass efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ALORE, an autonomous system for legged manipulators capable of efficiently and robustly rearranging large objects in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots capable of rearranging large and heavy objects can significantly reduce human workload, but the task remains challenging due to diverse interactions and ensuring collision-free operations.

Method: ALORE utilizes hierarchical reinforcement learning for multi-object environments, unified interaction representation, object velocity estimation, and a task-and-motion planning framework to optimize efficiency and enable online replanning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ALORE's robustness, achieving success in extensive simulations and real-world scenarios, including rearranging 32 chairs over 40 minutes without failure and completing a 40-meter autonomous rearrangement task.

Conclusion: ALORE showcases superior policy generalization, efficient multi-object rearrangement, and robustness, validated through systematic evaluations and extensive experiments. Open-source packages are available for public use.

Abstract: Endowing robots with the ability to rearrange various large and heavy objects, such as furniture, can substantially alleviate human workload. However, this task is extremely challenging due to the need to interact with diverse objects and efficiently rearrange multiple objects in complex environments while ensuring collision-free loco-manipulation. In this work, we present ALORE, an autonomous large-object rearrangement system for a legged manipulator that can rearrange various large objects across diverse scenarios. The proposed system is characterized by three main features: (i) a hierarchical reinforcement learning training pipeline for multi-object environment learning, where a high-level object velocity controller is trained on top of a low-level whole-body controller to achieve efficient and stable joint learning across multiple objects; (ii) two key modules, a unified interaction configuration representation and an object velocity estimator, that allow a single policy to regulate planar velocity of diverse objects accurately; and (iii) a task-and-motion planning framework that jointly optimizes object visitation order and object-to-target assignment, improving task efficiency while enabling online replanning. Comparisons against strong baselines show consistent superiority in policy generalization, object-velocity tracking accuracy, and multi-object rearrangement efficiency. Key modules are systematically evaluated, and extensive simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the entire system, which successfully completes 8 continuous loops to rearrange 32 chairs over nearly 40 minutes without a single failure, and executes long-distance autonomous rearrangement over an approximately 40 m route.

*Chaoqi Liu,Xiaoshen Han,Jiawei Gao,Yue Zhao,Haonan Chen,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study presents Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer enabling effective autoregressive modeling in continuous robot actions with improved performance and flexible inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable robot learning with autoregressive policies requires effective discrete action tokenization. Existing methods either lack structure or produce overly long token sequences, creating inefficiencies.

Method: The authors introduce OAT, which uses transformer registers, scalar quantization, and training mechanisms to create compressed, decodable, and causally ordered token spaces for robot actions.

Result: OAT-equipped autoregressive policies outperform existing tokenization and diffusion approaches across four simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks, enabling better inference-time flexibility and fidelity.

Conclusion: OAT satisfies key tokenization desiderata and offers superior performance in robot learning, making it a robust and flexible solution for action tokenization in autoregressive models.

Abstract: Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to train continuous-action vision-language-action (VLA) models using Minimum Error Entropy (MEE), showcasing enhanced success rates and robustness across different robotic manipulation settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing VLA models rely heavily on pointwise constraints in predictions, limiting their generalizability, especially in noisy and few-shot settings, thereby necessitating a better approach for training continuous-action VLA models.

Method: The paper proposes reshaping action error distributions using a trajectory-level MEE objective combined with MSE. It also introduces weighted variants to train modern VLA architectures, and evaluates them on simulated benchmarks and real-world tasks.

Result: Their approach yields consistent improvements in model success rates and robustness across standard, few-shot, noisy, and imbalanced data regimes, with negligible additional training cost and unaffected inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Incorporating MEE into VLA training enhances performance and robustness in robotic manipulation tasks, providing theoretical and practical benefits while maintaining operational efficiency.

Abstract: In robotic manipulation, vision-language-action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning generalizable and scalable robot policies. Most existing VLA frameworks rely on standard supervised objectives, typically cross-entropy for discrete actions and mean squared error (MSE) for continuous action regression, which impose strong pointwise constraints on individual predictions. In this work, we focus on continuous-action VLA models and move beyond conventional MSE-based regression by reshaping action error distributions during training. Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we introduce Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) into modern VLA architectures and propose a trajectory-level MEE objective, together with two weighted variants, combined with MSE for continuous-action VLA training. We evaluate our approaches across standard, few-shot, and noisy settings on multiple representative VLA architectures, using simulation benchmarks such as LIBERO and SimplerEnv as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in success rates and robustness across these settings. Under imbalanced data regimes, the gains persist within a well-characterized operating range, while incurring negligible additional training cost and no impact on inference efficiency. We further provide theoretical analyses that explain why MEE-based supervision is effective and characterize its practical range.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic grasping directed by natural language in cluttered or occluded scenes, which current methods struggle to handle effectively.

Method: Proposed GeoLanG, an end-to-end framework leveraging CLIP architecture for unified visual-linguistic representation. It introduces a Depth-guided Geometric Module (DGGM) for integrating depth as geometric priors and Adaptive Dense Channel Integration for better feature extraction.

Result: GeoLanG outperforms previous methods in complex scenarios, as tested on OCID-VLG dataset, simulation, and real-world hardware, achieving robust and precise grasping.

Conclusion: GeoLanG demonstrates strong potential in enabling advanced multimodal robotic manipulation under challenging real-world conditions, showcasing its reliability and adaptability.

Abstract: Language-guided grasping has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling robots to identify and manipulate target objects through natural language instructions, yet it remains highly challenging in cluttered or occluded scenes. Existing methods often rely on multi-stage pipelines that separate object perception and grasping, which leads to limited cross-modal fusion, redundant computation, and poor generalization in cluttered, occluded, or low-texture scenes. To address these limitations, we propose GeoLanG, an end-to-end multi-task framework built upon the CLIP architecture that unifies visual and linguistic inputs into a shared representation space for robust semantic alignment and improved generalization. To enhance target discrimination under occlusion and low-texture conditions, we explore a more effective use of depth information through the Depth-guided Geometric Module (DGGM), which converts depth into explicit geometric priors and injects them into the attention mechanism without additional computational overhead. In addition, we propose Adaptive Dense Channel Integration, which adaptively balances the contributions of multi-layer features to produce more discriminative and generalizable visual representations. Extensive experiments on the OCID-VLG dataset, as well as in both simulation and real-world hardware, demonstrate that GeoLanG enables precise and robust language-guided grasping in complex, cluttered environments, paving the way toward more reliable multimodal robotic manipulation in real-world human-centric settings.

Result: MAE-Select shows improved effectiveness in experiments and outperforms multi-camera setups in some scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed MAE-Select framework enhances single-camera systems for robotic manipulation, presenting a dynamic approach inspired by human active perception and achieving stronger task performance.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation continues to be a challenge, and imitation learning (IL) enables robots to learn tasks from expert demonstrations. Current IL methods typically rely on fixed camera setups, where cameras are manually positioned in static locations, imposing significant limitations on adaptability and coverage. Inspired by human active perception, where humans dynamically adjust their viewpoint to capture the most relevant and least noisy information, we propose MAE-Select, a novel framework for active viewpoint selection in single-camera robotic systems. MAE-Select fully leverages pre-trained multi-view masked autoencoder representations and dynamically selects the next most informative viewpoint at each time chunk without requiring labeled viewpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAE-Select improves the capabilities of single-camera systems and, in some cases, even surpasses multi-camera setups.

Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving models face challenges in diverse scenarios, such as lane perception, language biases, and rare corner cases. Vision-language models offer potential improvements but require further advancements.

Method: AppleVLM integrates a novel vision encoder using a deformable transformer for spatial-temporal fusion, a dedicated planning strategy to encode explicit spatial data, and a VLM decoder fine-tuned with Chain-of-Thought for robust driving outputs.

Result: AppleVLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on two CARLA simulation benchmarks and demonstrated successful real-world deployment on an autonomous guided vehicle.

Conclusion: AppleVLM advances robustness and generalization in autonomous driving by improving perception, planning, and decision-making, making it suitable for both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm integrating perception, decision-making, and control within a unified learning framework. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and generalization of end-to-end driving models in diverse and unseen scenarios. However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints. We evaluate AppleVLM in closed-loop experiments on two CARLA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art driving performance. Furthermore, we deploy AppleVLM on an AGV platform and successfully showcase real-world end-to-end autonomous driving in complex outdoor environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited zero-shot capabilities in robotics foundation models and improve their open-world generalization.

Method: The model integrates a hierarchical structure using ASM for affordance segmentation, 3DAgent for task planning, and a low-level control policy for precise robot manipulation. No real-world data collection is required.

Result: GeneralVLA outperformed state-of-the-art models like VoxPoser across 14 tasks and generated better training data for behavior cloning policies.

Conclusion: GeneralVLA offers a scalable approach to enhance robotic generalization and enable zero-shot performance, broadening the scope for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

Conclusion: The SDD Planner is practically applicable and deployable, successfully balancing safety and user-defined driving styles in real-world driving scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving safe and stylized trajectory planning in complex real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO.

*Dhyey Manish Rajani,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of selecting image matching thresholds for Visual Place Recognition in environments with changing conditions, proposing an automated method aimed at maximizing recall while meeting precision requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of fixed threshold tuning in Visual Place Recognition systems, especially under changing environmental conditions which degrade performance.

Method: A calibration-based approach is used to identify optimal thresholds based on user-defined precision requirements. Quantile normalization ensures the thresholds are robust and transferable across different environments and query scenarios.

Result: The method achieves up to 25% higher recall than existing approaches in high-precision regimes, demonstrating consistent performance across varied state-of-the-art techniques and datasets.

Conclusion: This approach eliminates manual threshold tuning by adapting to environmental changes, offering robust and generalizable performance for Visual Place Recognition.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a key component for localisation in GNSS-denied environments, but its performance critically depends on selecting an image matching threshold (operating point) that balances precision and recall. Thresholds are typically hand-tuned offline for a specific environment and fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental change. We propose a method that, given a user-defined precision requirement, automatically selects the operating point of a VPR system to maximise recall. The method uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalisation of similarity score distributions. This quantile transfer ensures that thresholds remain stable across calibration sizes and query subsets, making the method robust to sampling variability. Experiments with multiple state-of-the-art VPR techniques and datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method eliminates manual tuning by adapting to new environments and generalising across operating conditions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots often face performance issues due to small changes in dynamics, tasks, or environments, necessitating robust control strategies that adapt without requiring retraining.

Method: HoRD is a two-stage learning framework: (1) training a teacher policy with history-conditioned reinforcement learning to adapt to diverse dynamics; (2) using online distillation to transfer this robustness to a transformer-based student policy.

Result: HoRD demonstrated superior robustness and transfer performance in various experiments, especially in unseen domains and under external perturbations, outperforming strong baselines.

Conclusion: HoRD provides a robust solution for humanoid robot control, enabling zero-shot adaptation to new domains without retraining.

Abstract: Humanoid robots can suffer significant performance drops under small changes in dynamics, task specifications, or environment setup. We propose HoRD, a two-stage learning framework for robust humanoid control under domain shift. First, we train a high-performance teacher policy via history-conditioned reinforcement learning, where the policy infers latent dynamics context from recent state--action trajectories to adapt online to diverse randomized dynamics. Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining. Extensive experiments show HoRD outperforms strong baselines in robustness and transfer, especially under unseen domains and external perturbations.

Method: EPoG integrates a graph-based global planner with LLM-based local planning, updates a belief graph with observations, and computes action sequences via graph edits.

Result: EPoG achieved 91.3% success rates and a 36.1% reduction in travel distance in tests with realistic scenes and tasks, successfully executing tasks in unknown dynamic environments.

Conclusion: EPoG is effective in combining exploration and planning, showing promise for real-world robotic applications in dynamic, partially known environments.

Abstract: In partially known environments, robots must combine exploration to gather information with task planning for efficient execution. To address this challenge, we propose EPoG, an Exploration-based sequential manipulation Planning framework on Scene Graphs. EPoG integrates a graph-based global planner with a Large Language Model (LLM)-based situated local planner, continuously updating a belief graph using observations and LLM predictions to represent known and unknown objects. Action sequences are generated by computing graph edit operations between the goal and belief graphs, ordered by temporal dependencies and movement costs. This approach seamlessly combines exploration and sequential manipulation planning. In ablation studies across 46 realistic household scenes and 5 long-horizon daily object transportation tasks, EPoG achieved a success rate of 91.3%, reducing travel distance by 36.1% on average. Furthermore, a physical mobile manipulator successfully executed complex tasks in unknown and dynamic environments, demonstrating EPoG's potential for real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bio-inspired solution using soft morphing wings with proprioceptive sensing to maintain stability for underwater vehicles in disruptive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shallow water hydrodynamic disturbances hinder the stability and functionality of unmanned underwater vehicles. The paper seeks inspiration from marine organisms to overcome these challenges.

Method: Development of hydraulically actuated soft wings with controllable camber, including dynamic modeling, curvature sensing to estimate disturbances, and implementing a controller based on these estimates.

Result: The model demonstrated accurate estimation of disturbances based on curvature sensing and improved stability by rejecting lift disturbances in a controlled environment.

Conclusion: The combination of proprioceptive sensing and disturbance observers provides a biologically inspired approach to enhance stability in soft underwater vehicles, ensuring functionality in challenging environments.

Abstract: Unmanned underwater vehicles are increasingly employed for maintenance and surveying tasks at sea, but their operation in shallow waters is often hindered by hydrodynamic disturbances such as waves, currents, and turbulence. These unsteady flows can induce rapid changes in direction and speed, compromising vehicle stability and manoeuvrability. Marine organisms contend with such conditions by combining proprioceptive feedback with flexible fins and tails to reject disturbances. Inspired by this strategy, we propose soft morphing wings endowed with proprioceptive sensing to mitigate environmental perturbations. The wing's continuous deformation provides a natural means to infer dynamic disturbances: sudden changes in camber directly reflect variations in the oncoming flow. By interpreting this proprioceptive signal, a disturbance observer can reconstruct flow parameters in real time. To enable this, we develop and experimentally validate a dynamic model of a hydraulically actuated soft wing with controllable camber. We then show that curvature-based sensing allows accurate estimation of disturbances in the angle of attack. Finally, we demonstrate that a controller leveraging these proprioceptive estimates can reject disturbances in the lift response of the soft wing. By combining proprioceptive sensing with a disturbance observer, this technique mirrors biological strategies and provides a pathway for soft underwater vehicles to maintain stability in hazardous environments.

*Yu Bai,MingMing Yu,Chaojie Li,Ziyi Bai,Xinlong Wang,Börje F. Karlsson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EgoActor is a scalable vision-language model for humanoid robots to robustly integrate perception, locomotion, and manipulation in changing environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing humanoid robots capable of transitioning between complex sub-tasks in dynamic environments remains a significant challenge.

Method: A scalable vision-language model, EgoActor, is proposed, leveraging broad supervision through egocentric data and integrating various humanoid robot actions under 1-second inference time.

Result: Evaluations show EgoActor bridges abstract task planning and motor execution, generalizing effectively to diverse tasks and environments.

Conclusion: EgoActor advances real-time humanoid robot control by enabling precise, contextually-aware humanoid actions in dynamic and unfamiliar scenarios.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots in real-world settings is fundamentally challenging, as it demands tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial-information observations and dynamically changing environments. As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.

*Xunlan Zhou,Hongrui Zhao,Negar Mehr*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces TACO, a framework for continual neural mapping, enabling robots to adapt to changing environments without storing past data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of continual adaptation to dynamic environments for robotic navigation and mapping, under memory and computational constraints.

Method: The method, TACO, reformulates mapping as a temporal consensus optimization, treating previous model states as temporal neighbors and leveraging weighted consensus with past representations instead of replaying historical observations.

Result: The results indicate that TACO reliably adapts to dynamic scene changes and outperforms traditional continual learning approaches in both simulated and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: TACO provides an effective and memory-efficient solution for continual neural mapping in dynamic robotic settings, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Neural implicit mapping has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic navigation and scene understanding. However, real-world robotic deployment requires continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory and computation constraints, which existing mapping systems fail to support. Most prior methods rely on replaying historical observations to preserve consistency and assume static scenes. As a result, they cannot adapt to continual learning in dynamic robotic settings. To address these challenges, we propose TACO (TemporAl Consensus Optimization), a replay-free framework for continual neural mapping. We reformulate mapping as a temporal consensus optimization problem, where we treat past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Intuitively, our approach resembles a model consulting its own past knowledge. We update the current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations. Our method allows reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable or outdated regions to be revised in response to new observations. TACO achieves a balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing or replaying previous data. Through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that TACO robustly adapts to scene changes, and consistently outperforms other continual learning baselines.

### [362] [A Unified Complementarity-based Approach for Rigid-Body Manipulation and Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04522)
*Bingkun Huang,Xin Ma,Nilanjan Chakraborty,Riddhiman Laha*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified modeling framework (Unicomp) for robotic manipulation that integrates free motion and frictional contact using complementarity-based dynamics, supporting efficient planning of contact-rich behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks inadequately model non-convex or distributed contact patches and separate free motion from contact modeling, limiting real-time performance and robust transitions between contact modes.

Method: The authors develop a framework using linear and nonlinear complementarity problems to integrate free-space motion and frictional contact. They formulate a frictional contact model based on an ellipsoidal limit surface and use quadratic constraints for predictive modeling.

Result: The proposed framework achieves stable and physically consistent behaviors in real-time across tasks such as planar pushing and whole-body maneuvers.

Conclusion: This modeling approach improves robotic manipulation in unstructured environments by realistically capturing frictional contact dynamics for real-time optimization and task execution.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires planners to reason jointly about free-space motion and sustained, frictional contact with the environment. Existing (local) planning and simulation frameworks typically separate these regimes or rely on simplified contact representations, particularly when modeling non-convex or distributed contact patches. Such approximations limit the fidelity of contact-mode transitions and hinder the robust execution of contact-rich behaviors in real time. This paper presents a unified discrete-time modeling framework for robotic manipulation that consistently captures both free motion and frictional contact within a single mathematical formalism (Unicomp). Building on complementarity-based rigid-body dynamics, we formulate free-space motion and contact interactions as coupled linear and nonlinear complementarity problems, enabling principled transitions between contact modes without enforcing fixed-contact assumptions. For planar patch contact, we derive a frictional contact model from the maximum power dissipation principle in which the set of admissible contact wrenches is represented by an ellipsoidal limit surface. This representation captures coupled force-moment effects, including torsional friction, while remaining agnostic to the underlying pressure distribution across the contact patch. The resulting formulation yields a discrete-time predictive model that relates generalized velocities and contact wrenches through quadratic constraints and is suitable for real-time optimization-based planning. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables stable, physically consistent behavior at interactive speeds across tasks, from planar pushing to contact-rich whole-body maneuvers.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoMe-VLA, a framework for enhancing robotic manipulation in complex, unconstrained environments using active perception strategies and human-inspired egocentric data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current robotic sensing behaviors restricted to specific environments and improve generalizable manipulation capabilities.

Method: Introduced a cognitive and memory-aware framework (CoMe-VLA) utilizing large-scale egocentric data, including a cognitive auxiliary head and dual-track memory system for superior environmental and self-awareness, trained in stages.

Result: Experiments show robustness and adaptability of CoMe-VLA across diverse long-horizon tasks in active perception scenarios using a wheel-based humanoid robot.

Conclusion: CoMe-VLA advances active perception in robotics by aligning human-like behaviors and maintaining consistent environmental awareness, proving its effectiveness for generalizable manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Achieving generalizable manipulation in unconstrained environments requires the robot to proactively resolve information uncertainty, i.e., the capability of active perception. However, existing methods are often confined in limited types of sensing behaviors, restricting their applicability to complex environments. In this work, we formalize active perception as a non-Markovian process driven by information gain and decision branching, providing a structured categorization of visual active perception paradigms. Building on this perspective, we introduce CoMe-VLA, a cognitive and memory-aware vision-language-action (VLA) framework that leverages large-scale human egocentric data to learn versatile exploration and manipulation priors. Our framework integrates a cognitive auxiliary head for autonomous sub-task transitions and a dual-track memory system to maintain consistent self and environmental awareness by fusing proprioceptive and visual temporal contexts. By aligning human and robot hand-eye coordination behaviors in a unified egocentric action space, we train the model progressively in three stages. Extensive experiments on a wheel-based humanoid have demonstrated strong robustness and adaptability of our proposed method across diverse long-horizon tasks spanning multiple active perception scenarios.

*Roberto Ferroni,Daniele Filippo Mauceri,Jacopo Carpaneto,Alessandra Pedrocchi,Tommaso Proietti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses the improvement of a soft shoulder exosuit to enhance comfort and functional support for upper-limb tasks without reducing its assistive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduced shoulder mobility impacts daily activities, necessitating the development of wearable devices that can assist while ensuring long-term comfort.

Method: The study redesigned a soft shoulder exosuit to address comfort limitations and improve assistive functions. A controlled comparison of the previous and redesigned versions was conducted involving healthy participants performing various tasks. Muscle activity, kinematics, and user feedback were analyzed.

Result: The redesigned exosuit enhanced transverse plane mobility by 30 deg, improved forward arm positioning, reduced muscular demand, and received better user ratings on wearability, effectiveness, ease of use, and comfort compared to the prior version.

Conclusion: Refinements focusing on user-centered design can significantly enhance comfort and usability without compromising assistive performance, making soft exosuits suitable for long-term daily use.

Abstract: Reduced shoulder mobility limits upper-limb function and the performance of activities of daily living across a wide range of conditions. Wearable exosuits have shown promise in assisting arm elevation, reducing muscle effort, and supporting functional movements; however, comfort is rarely prioritized as an explicit design objective, despite it strongly affects real-life, long-term usage. This study presents a redesigned soft shoulder exosuit (Soft Shoulder v2) developed to address comfort-related limitations identified in our previous version, while preserving assistive performance. In parallel, assistance was also improved, shifting from the coronal plane to the sagittal plane to better support functionally relevant hand positioning. A controlled comparison between the previous (v1) and redesigned (v2) modules was conducted in eight healthy participants, who performed static holding, dynamic lifting, and a functional pick and place task. Muscle activity, kinematics, and user-reported outcomes were assessed. Both versions increased endurance time, reduced deltoid activation, and preserved transparency during unpowered shoulder elevation. However, the difference between them emerged most clearly during functional tasks and comfort evaluation. The redesigned module facilitated forward arm positioning and increased transverse plane mobility by up to 30 deg, without increasing muscular demand. User-reported outcomes further indicated a substantial improvement in wearability, with markedly lower perceived pressure and higher ratings in effectiveness, ease of use, and comfort compared to the previous design. Taken together, these findings show that targeted, user-centered design refinements can improve comfort and functional interaction without compromising assistive performance, advancing the development of soft exosuits suitable for prolonged and daily use.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms to enhance robot navigation states estimation, especially for UAVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges faced by exteroceptive sensors in extreme environmental conditions through radar sensing technology.

Method: Proposes RIO algorithms using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Factor Graphs (FG), and deep learning for radar and IMU data fusion.

Result: The algorithms operate effectively on portable, resource-constrained systems using consumer-grade sensors for UAV navigation.

Conclusion: RIO enhances robot autonomy and navigation reliability in challenging environments using low-cost and lightweight technologies.

Abstract: Recently, the progress in the radar sensing technology consisting in the miniaturization of the packages and increase in measuring precision has drawn the interest of the robotics research community. Indeed, a crucial task enabling autonomy in robotics is to precisely determine the pose of the robot in space. To fulfill this task sensor fusion algorithms are often used, in which data from one or several exteroceptive sensors like, for example, LiDAR, camera, laser ranging sensor or GNSS are fused together with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to obtain an estimate of the navigation states of the robot. Nonetheless, owing to their particular sensing principles, some exteroceptive sensors are often incapacitated in extreme environmental conditions, like extreme illumination or presence of fine particles in the environment like smoke or fog. Radars are largely immune to aforementioned factors thanks to the characteristics of electromagnetic waves they use. In this thesis, we present Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms to fuse the information from IMU and radar in order to estimate the navigation states of a (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) UAV capable of running on a portable resource-constrained embedded computer in real-time and making use of inexpensive, consumer-grade sensors. We present novel RIO approaches relying on the multi-state tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Factor Graphs (FG) fusing instantaneous velocities of and distances to 3D points delivered by a lightweight, low-cost, off-the-shelf Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with IMU readings. We also show a novel way to exploit advances in deep learning to retrieve 3D point correspondences in sparse and noisy radar point clouds.

*Julia Kuhn,Francesco Verdoja,Tsvetomila Mihaylova,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores improving natural human-robot interaction by combining large language models (LLMs) with enhanced 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) that include spatial relationships for object grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in human environments need to better understand natural language commands, which require grounding commands in their knowledge of the environment and spatial relations.

Method: The authors developed an LLM-based pipeline for grounding objects and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline for adding spatial relations to 3DSGs using open-vocabulary descriptors.

Result: Explicit spatial relations improved LLMs' grounding abilities. Open-vocabulary relation generation using VLMs is feasible but has limited benefit over closed-vocabulary relations.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial relations into 3DSGs enhances LLMs' ability to interpret natural language commands. Open-vocabulary relations are feasible but not significantly superior to closed-vocabulary ones.

Abstract: Robots are finding wider adoption in human environments, increasing the need for natural human-robot interaction. However, understanding a natural language command requires the robot to infer the intended task and how to decompose it into executable actions, and to ground those actions in the robot's knowledge of the environment, including relevant objects, agents, and locations. This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment. However, many 3DSGs lack explicit spatial relations between objects, even though humans often rely on these relations to describe an environment. This paper investigates whether incorporating open- or closed-vocabulary spatial relations into 3DSGs can improve the ability of LLMs to interpret natural language commands. To address this, we propose an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3DSGs from images captured while mapping. Finally, two LLMs are evaluated in a study assessing their performance on the downstream task of target object grounding. Our study demonstrates that explicit spatial relations improve the ability of LLMs to ground objects. Moreover, open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs proves feasible from robot-captured images, but their advantage over closed-vocabulary relations is found to be limited.

TL;DR: The study presents a vision-gated control framework for active lumbar exoskeletons using egocentric vision and gaze tracking, showing improved assistance, reduced physical demand, and user preference in lifting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in providing timely and context-aware assistance for back-support exoskeletons in industrial handling applications.

Method: The paper introduces a vision-gated control framework based on egocentric vision and wearable gaze tracking, integrating real-time YOLO-based grasp detection, a finite-state machine for task tracking, and a variable admittance controller for torque adaptation.

Result: A study with 15 participants demonstrated that vision-gated assistance significantly reduced perceived physical demand and enhanced comfort, fluency, and trust. Quantitative analysis showed earlier and stronger assistance when vision systems were enabled.

Conclusion: Incorporating egocentric vision into active lumbar exoskeletons enhances responsiveness, ergonomics, safety, and user acceptance, showcasing its potential in industrial applications.

Abstract: Back-support exoskeletons have been proposed to mitigate spinal loading in industrial handling, yet their effectiveness critically depends on timely and context-aware assistance. Most existing approaches rely either on load-estimation techniques (e.g., EMG, IMU) or on vision systems that do not directly inform control. In this work, we present a vision-gated control framework for an active lumbar occupational exoskeleton that leverages egocentric vision with wearable gaze tracking. The proposed system integrates real-time grasp detection from a first-person YOLO-based perception system, a finite-state machine (FSM) for task progression, and a variable admittance controller to adapt torque delivery to both posture and object state. A user study with 15 participants performing stooping load lifting trials under three conditions (no exoskeleton, exoskeleton without vision, exoskeleton with vision) shows that vision-gated assistance significantly reduces perceived physical demand and improves fluency, trust, and comfort. Quantitative analysis reveals earlier and stronger assistance when vision is enabled, while questionnaire results confirm user preference for the vision-gated mode. These findings highlight the potential of egocentric vision to enhance the responsiveness, ergonomics, safety, and acceptance of back-support exoskeletons.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the lack of clarity in defining "dull, dirty, and dangerous" (DDD) work in robotics and proposes a structured framework for addressing this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics often uses the concept of "dull, dirty, and dangerous" work to justify its applications, but there is a lack of clear definitions and examples of DDD tasks in the literature.

Method: An empirical analysis was conducted on robotics publications from 1980 to 2024 that refer to DDD work. Social science literature was also reviewed to derive clear definitions and guidance for conceptualizing these tasks.

Result: The analysis reveals that only a small percentage of papers define or provide examples of DDD tasks. The authors contribute definitions and propose a framework for assessing the job context in robotics.

Conclusion: The framework aims to deepen the robotics community's understanding of DDD work and to encourage consideration of robotics' broader impact on human labor.

Abstract: In robotics, the concept of "dull, dirty, and dangerous" (DDD) work has been used to motivate where robots might be useful. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of robotics publications between 1980 and 2024 that mention DDD, and find that only 2.7% of publications define DDD and 8.7% of publications provide concrete examples of tasks or jobs that are DDD. We then review the social science literature on "dull," "dirty," and "dangerous" work to provide definitions and guidance on how to conceptualize DDD for robotics. Finally, we propose a framework that helps the robotics community consider the job context for our technology, encouraging a more informed perspective on how robotics may impact human labor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data, limiting the adoption of pose and motion priors in humanoid robotics.

Method: The authors create PDF-HR, a lightweight prior for robot pose distribution, using distance measures to a corpus of retargeted robot poses. It integrates seamlessly into various pipelines to optimize control and plausibility.

Result: PDF-HR is tested across tasks like motion tracking and retargeting, showing significant performance improvements in strong baseline systems.

Conclusion: PDF-HR provides a reliable and effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing humanoid robot capabilities, with code and models planned for release.

Abstract: Pose and motion priors play a crucial role in humanoid robotics. Although such priors have been widely studied in human motion recovery (HMR) domain with a range of models, their adoption for humanoid robots remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data. In this work, we introduce Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR), a lightweight prior that represents the robot pose distribution as a continuous and differentiable manifold. Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: This paper explores how visual encoders can be evaluated analytically for their ability to generalize across environments, proposing probing environment state as an effective metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for visual representations in robotics focus narrowly on aspects like object shape, which limits their effectiveness across diverse settings.

Method: This study probes pretrained visual encoders by measuring their ability to decode environment states, including geometry, object structure, and physical attributes, using simulation environments with ground-truth data.

Result: Probing accuracy of visual encoders strongly correlates with policy performance in various environments, outperforming previous metrics and allowing efficient representation selection.

Conclusion: Efficient representation selection for scalable robot policies can be enabled through probing visual encoders for environment-state decoding, pointing towards latent physical state encoding as a useful control objective.

Abstract: The choice of visual representation is key to scaling generalist robot policies. However, direct evaluation via policy rollouts is expensive, even in simulation. Existing proxy metrics focus on the representation's capacity to capture narrow aspects of the visual world, like object shape, limiting generalization across environments. In this paper, we take an analytical perspective: we probe pretrained visual encoders by measuring how well they support decoding of environment state -- including geometry, object structure, and physical attributes -- from images. Leveraging simulation environments with access to ground-truth state, we show that this probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection. More broadly, our study provides insight into the representational properties that support generalizable manipulation, suggesting that learning to encode the latent physical state of the environment is a promising objective for control.

Motivation: To explore the diverse, often conflicting needs and motivations within open source software ecosystems, and understand how communities manage accountability to stakeholders.

Method: Gathered 24 experts for an in-person workshop at Carnegie Mellon University to explore accountability concerns in open source ecosystems.

Result: Initiated meaningful discussions, posed urgent questions on accountability, and inspired a future research agenda for open source software ecosystems.

Conclusion: Accountability is a key challenge in open source ecosystems, and further research and engagement among stakeholders are essential for addressing these issues effectively.

Abstract: Open source software ecosystems are composed of a variety of stakeholders including but not limited to non-profit organizations, volunteer contributors, users, and corporations.

Given this, it is not clear how open source communities identify and engage with their stakeholders, understand their needs, and hold themselves accountable to those needs. We convened 24 expert scholars and practitioners studying and working with open source software communities for an exploratory workshop discussion on these ideas. The workshop titled "Accountability and Open Source Software Ecosystems" was organized on Oct 14-15 on campus in Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. The purpose of this in-person workshop was to initiate conversations that explore important and urgent questions related to the role of accountability in open source software ecosystems, and to inspire an exciting research agenda and meaningful stakeholder engagement ideas for practitioners.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve mutation generation for Simulink-Stateflow models, showcasing faster and higher-quality results compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of redundancy, equivalence, and execution issues in traditional mutation analysis within Simulink-Stateflow models, especially in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems.

Method: The authors developed an automated pipeline for Simulink-Stateflow models, converting them to JSON and evaluating mutation strategies across eight LLMs. They also conducted a study on 38,400 mutants.

Result: LLMs generated mutants 13x faster with fewer redundant or equivalent results compared to engineered baselines, and few-shot prompting with optimal temperature settings enhanced performance.

Conclusion: The success of LLMs in generating efficient and high-quality mutants supports their adoption, and the paper offers a prototype tool and dataset for broader use and further research.

Abstract: Mutation analysis is a powerful technique for assessing test-suite adequacy, yet conventional approaches suffer from generating redundant, equivalent, or non-executable mutants. These challenges are particularly amplified in Simulink-Stateflow models due to the hierarchical structure these models have, which integrate continuous dynamics with discrete-event behaviors and are widely deployed in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). While prior work has explored machine learning and manually engineered mutation operators, these approaches remain constrained by limited training data and scalability issues. Motivated by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate their potential to generate high-quality, domain-specific mutants for Simulink-Stateflow models. We develop an automated pipeline that converts Simulink-Stateflow models to structured JSON representations and systematically evaluates different mutation and prompting strategies across eight state-of-the-art LLMs. Through a comprehensive empirical study involving 38,400 LLM-generated mutants across four Simulink-Stateflow models, we demonstrate that LLMs generate mutants up to 13x faster than a manually engineered mutation-based baseline while producing significantly fewer equivalent and duplicate mutants and consistently achieving superior mutant quality. Moreover, our analysis reveals that few-shot prompting combined with low-to-medium temperature values yields optimal results. We provide an open-source prototype tool and release our complete dataset to facilitate reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Result: Using static analysis guidance increases success rate by 21% compared to the baseline. However, manual inspection reveals 71.5% of PoCs are invalid, exposing weaknesses in current validation systems.

Conclusion: LLM-generated PoC success rates can be misleading without robust validation. Static analysis shows promise but invalid PoCs remain a hurdle.

Abstract: Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in security vulnerability detection tasks including generating proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. A PoC exploit is a program used to demonstrate how a vulnerability can be exploited. Several approaches suggest that supporting LLMs with additional guidance can improve PoC generation outcomes, motivating further evaluation of their effectiveness. In this work, we develop PoC-Gym, a framework for PoC generation for Java security vulnerabilities via LLMs and systematic validation of generated exploits. Using PoC-Gym, we evaluate whether the guidance from static analysis tools improves the PoC generation success rate and manually inspect the resulting PoCs. Our results from running PoC-Gym with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5 Medium, and gpt-oss-20b show that using static analysis for guidance and criteria lead to 21% higher success rates than the prior baseline, FaultLine. However, manual inspection of both successful and failed PoCs reveals that 71.5% of the PoCs are invalid. These results show that the reported success of LLM-based PoC generation can be significantly misleading, which is hard to detect with current validation mechanisms.

Motivation: The influx of AI-generated answers on Stack Overflow, particularly from ChatGPT, risks the reliability of information on the platform despite its ban on such content. This motivates the need for efficient detection methods.

Method: The paper employs Siamese Neural Networks with the BigBird model and uses Triplet loss, leveraging triplets of human answers, reference answers, and ChatGPT answers for accurate detection.

Result: Empirical tests reveal SOGPTSpotter surpasses existing systems like GPTZero, DetectGPT, GLTR, BERT, and others in detecting ChatGPT-generated content. Additional experiments validate its robustness, generalization, and resilience against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: SOGPTSpotter is an effective and practical tool for detecting ChatGPT-generated content on Stack Overflow, aiding moderators in maintaining content reliability on the platform.

Abstract: Stack Overflow is a popular Q&A platform where users ask technical questions and receive answers from a community of experts. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of answers generated by ChatGPT, which can lead to incorrect and unreliable information being posted on the site. While Stack Overflow has banned such AI-generated content, detecting whether a post is ChatGPT-generated remains a challenging task. We introduce a novel approach, SOGPTSpotter, that employs Siamese Neural Networks, leveraging the BigBird model and the Triplet loss, to detect ChatGPT-generated answers on Stack Overflow. We use triplets of human answers, reference answers, and ChatGPT answers. Our empirical evaluation reveals that our approach outperforms well-established baselines like GPTZero, DetectGPT, GLTR, BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 in identifying ChatGPT-synthesized Stack Overflow responses. We also conducted an ablation study to show the effectiveness of our model. Additional experiments were conducted to assess various factors, including the impact of text length, the model's robustness against adversarial attacks, and its generalization capabilities across different domains and large language models. We also conducted a real-world case study on Stack Overflow. Using our tool's recommendations, Stack Overflow moderators were able to identify and take down ChatGPT-suspected generated answers, demonstrating the practical applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

### [375] [Semantic Consensus Decoding: Backdoor Defense for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04195)
*Guang Yang,Xing Hu,Xiang Chen,Xin Xia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) used in Verilog code generation to backdoor attacks, introducing a defense mechanism called Semantic Consensus Decoding (SCD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counteract the threat of hardware backdoor attacks in LLM-generated Verilog designs, which pose unique and severe challenges due to the irreversible nature of hardware vulnerabilities.

Method: The proposed Semantic Consensus Decoding (SCD) involves: (1) extracting functional requirements from user specifications and (2) using consensus decoding to identify and suppress potentially malicious components based on discrepancies in output distributions.

Result: SCD significantly reduces the average attack success rate from 89% to under 3% with minimal degradation in the quality of generated hardware designs.

Conclusion: Semantic Consensus Decoding effectively mitigates backdoor attacks during inference time in LLM-generated hardware designs, offering a practical and passive defensive solution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Verilog code generation are increasingly adopted in hardware design, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks where adversaries inject malicious triggers during training to induce vulnerable hardware designs. Unlike patchable software vulnerabilities, hardware trojans become irreversible once fabricated, making remediation extremely costly or impossible. Existing active defenses require access to training data, impractical for third-party LLM users, while passive defenses struggle against semantically stealthy triggers that naturally blend into design specifications. In this paper, we hypothesize that under the requirements of both effectiveness and stealthiness, attackers are strongly biased toward embedding triggers in non-functional requirements (e.g., style modifiers, quality descriptors) rather than functional specifications that determine hardware behavior. Exploiting this insight, we propose Semantic Consensus Decoding (SCD), an inference-time passive defense with two key components: (1) functional requirement extraction that identifies essential requirements from user specifications, and (2) consensus decoding that adaptively fuses output distributions based on full user specifications and extracted functional requirements. When these distributions diverge significantly, SCD automatically suppresses suspicious components. Extensive experiments with three representative backdoor attacks demonstrate that SCD reduces average attack success rate from 89% to under 3% with negligible impact on generation quality.

### [376] [Why Agentic-PRs Get Rejected: A Comparative Study of Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04226)
*Sota Nakashima,Yuta Ishimoto,Masanari Kondo,Shane Mclntosh,Yasutaka Kamei*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates rejection reasons for Pull Requests (PRs) produced by different autonomous coding agents, finding agent-specific failure patterns and proposing heuristics for better understanding rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why PRs generated by different coding agents face rejection and how agent-specific behaviors influence outcomes, given the increasing adoption of autonomous coding agents.

Method: Analyzed a dataset of 654 rejected PRs from five coding agents and a human baseline. Identified rejection modes specific to agentic PRs and proposed heuristics to improve analysis of rejection reasons.

Result: Found seven rejection modes unique to agentic PRs, observed agent-specific patterns, and highlighted that 67.9% of rejected PRs lack explicit reviewer feedback.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need to recognize distinct failure patterns in agentic PRs and suggests heuristics to address the challenge of unclear rejection reasons in future research.

Abstract: Agentic coding -- software development workflows in which autonomous coding agents plan, implement, and submit code changes with minimal human involvement -- is rapidly gaining traction. Prior work has shown that Pull Requests (PRs) produced using coding agents (Agentic-PRs) are accepted less often than PRs that are not labeled as agentic (Human-PRs). The rejection reasons for a single agent (Claude Code) have been explored, but a comparison of how rejection reasons differ between Agentic-PRs generated by different agents has not yet been performed. This comparison is important since different coding agents are often used for different purposes, which can lead to agent-specific failure patterns. In this paper, we inspect 654 rejected PRs from the AIDev dataset covering five coding agents, as well as a human baseline. Our results show that seven rejection modes occur only in Agentic-PRs, including distrust of AI-generated code. We also observe agent-specific patterns (e.g., automated withdrawal of inactive PRs by Devin), reflecting differences in how agents are configured and used in practice. Notably, a large proportion of rejected PRs (67.9%) lack explicit reviewer feedback, making their rejection reasons difficult to determine. To mitigate this issue, we propose a set of heuristics that reduce the proportion of such cases, offering a practical preprocessing step for future studies of PR rejection in agentic coding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing static benchmarks and simplistic metrics in evaluating real-world effectiveness of LLM-based code generation.

Method: ProxyWar systematically embeds LLM-generated agents into competitive game environments, combining automated testing, iterative code repair, and multi-agent tournaments for evaluation.

Result: Application of ProxyWar uncovers discrepancies between benchmark scores and actual dynamic performance, highlighting overlooked limitations and areas for improvement in LLM code generation.

Conclusion: ProxyWar underscores the importance of richer, competition-based evaluations, offering a foundation for further research into adaptive problem-solving and practical efficiency of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated code generation, yet the evaluation of their real-world effectiveness remains limited by static benchmarks and simplistic metrics. We present ProxyWar, a novel framework that systematically assesses code generation quality by embedding LLM-generated agents within diverse, competitive game environments. Unlike existing approaches, ProxyWar evaluates not only functional correctness but also the operational characteristics of generated programs, combining automated testing, iterative code repair, and multi-agent tournaments to provide a holistic view of program behavior. Applied to a range of state-of-the-art coders and games, our approach uncovers notable discrepancies between benchmark scores and actual performance in dynamic settings, revealing overlooked limitations and opportunities for improvement. These findings highlight the need for richer, competition-based evaluation of code generation. Looking forward, ProxyWar lays a foundation for research into LLM-driven algorithm discovery, adaptive problem solving, and the study of practical efficiency and robustness, including the potential for models to outperform hand-crafted agents.

### [378] [Model-Driven Legacy System Modernization at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04341)
*Tobias Böhm,Jens Guan Su Tien,Mohini Nonnenmann,Tom Schoonbaert,Bart Carpels,Andreas Biesdorf*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model-driven approach for modernizing legacy systems by introducing an intermediate model for structured migration to modern platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in migrating legacy systems to modern platforms while maintaining functional and non-functional qualities.

Method: The authors use a four-stage process: analysis, enrichment, synthesis, and transition, involving an intermediate enriched model to abstract and transform system artifacts.

Result: Application to a large .NET-based system showed semi-automatic migration of UI and code elements while retaining functionality; however, bespoke layouts required manual adjustments.

Conclusion: The approach enhances maintainability, extensibility, and developer experience, reduces modernization risks, and can generalize to other legacy migration scenarios.

Abstract: This experience report presents a model-driven approach to legacy system modernization that inserts an enriched, technology-agnostic intermediate model between the legacy codebase and the modern target platform, and reports on its application and evaluation. The four-stage process of analysis, enrichment, synthesis, and transition systematically extracts, abstracts, and transforms system artifacts. We apply our approach to a large industrial application built on legacy versions of the .NET Framework and ASP.NET MVC and show that core user interface components and page structures can be migrated semi-automatically to a modern web stack while preserving functional behavior and essential non-functional qualities. By consolidating architectural knowledge into explicit model representations, the resulting codebase exhibits higher maintainability and extensibility, thereby improving developer experience. Although automation is effective for standard patterns, migration of bespoke layout composites remains challenging and requires targeted manual adaptation. Our contributions are: (i) an end-to-end model-driven process, (ii) an enriched intermediate model that captures structure, dependencies, and semantic metadata, (iii) transformation rules that preserve functional behavior and essential non-functional qualities, and (iv) application and evaluation of the approach in an industrial setting. Overall, model-based abstractions reduce risk and effort while supporting scalable, traceable modernization of legacy applications. Our approach generalizes to comparable modernization contexts and promotes reuse of migration patterns.

*Stefan Otten,Philipp Reis,Philipp Rigoll,Joshua Ransiek,Tobias Schürmann,Jacob Langner,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces the LLM Risk Assessment Framework (LRF) to evaluate and manage risks associated with using Large Language Models in Systems Engineering environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges organizations face in assessing risks tied to the use of Large Language Models within complex engineering processes.

Method: The LLM Risk Assessment Framework (LRF) was developed to classify LLM-based applications based on autonomy (supportive assistance to fully automated decision making) and impact (severity of errors).

Result: By combining autonomy and impact dimensions, LRF facilitates risk classification, enabling organizations to define validation strategies, human oversight levels, and countermeasures.

Conclusion: LRF promotes a risk-aware approach for adopting LLMs in engineering, aligning AI adoption with principles of reliability, traceability, and controlled integration.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant opportunities across the engineering lifecycle, including requirements engineering, software development, process optimization, and decision support. Despite this potential, organizations face substantial challenges in assessing the risks associated with LLM use, resulting in inconsistent integration, unknown failure modes, and limited scalability. This paper introduces the LLM Risk Assessment Framework (LRF), a structured approach for evaluating the application of LLMs within Systems Engineering (SE) environments. The framework classifies LLM-based applications along two fundamental dimensions: autonomy, ranging from supportive assistance to fully automated decision making, and impact, reflecting the potential severity of incorrect or misleading model outputs on engineering processes and system elements. By combining these dimensions, the LRF enables consistent determination of corresponding risk levels across the development lifecycle. The resulting classification supports organizations in identifying appropriate validation strategies, levels of human oversight, and required countermeasures to ensure safe and transparent deployment. The framework thereby helps align the rapid evolution of AI technologies with established engineering principles of reliability, traceability, and controlled process integration. Overall, the LRF provides a basis for risk-aware adoption of LLMs in complex engineering environments and represents a first step toward standardized AI assurance practices in systems engineering.

*Rudra Dhar,Karthik Vaidhyanathan,Vasudeva Varma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents AgenticAKM, a framework where agents collaborate to automate Architecture Knowledge Management (AKM), validated to generate better Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual AKM is labor-intensive, often ignored by developers and architects, and lacks efficiency. Automation using LLMs faces context-related limitations and struggles with distributed knowledge.

Method: The paper proposes AgenticAKM, a systematic workflow where agents specialized in architecture Extraction, Retrieval, Generation, and Validation work together to manage AKM effectively.

Result: An initial demo of AgenticAKM was tested with 29 repositories, showing improved generation of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: AgenticAKM is a practical and promising method for automating AKM and enhancing the generation of architectural documentation.

Abstract: Architecture Knowledge Management (AKM) is crucial for maintaining current and comprehensive software Architecture Knowledge (AK) in a software project. However AKM is often a laborious process and is not adopted by developers and architects. While LLMs present an opportunity for automation, a naive, single-prompt approach is often ineffective, constrained by context limits and an inability to grasp the distributed nature of architectural knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic approach for AKM, AgenticAKM, where the complex problem of architecture recovery and documentation is decomposed into manageable sub-tasks. Specialized agents for architecture Extraction, Retrieval, Generation, and Validation collaborate in a structured workflow to generate AK. To validate we made an initial instantiation of our approach to generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) from code repositories. We validated our approach through a user study with 29 repositories. The results demonstrate that our agentic approach generates better ADRs, and is a promising and practical approach for automating AKM.

TL;DR: This paper studies submissions to SWE-Bench leaderboards for program repair using real Python issues and identifies industry dominance and the use of proprietary LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the impact and trends in APR using LLMs on SWE-Bench leaderboards and highlight transparency and diversity challenges in research.

Method: The study analyzes 79 entries from the Lite leaderboard and 133 entries from the Verified leaderboard, categorizing them by origin (industry, academia), type of LLM used, and openness.

Result: Industry submissions are predominant and outperform academic ones on average. Proprietary LLMs like Claude family dominate, with Claude 4 Sonnet achieving the best results.

Conclusion: This reflection on the SWE-Bench ecosystem emphasizes the need for transparency, diversity, and greater openness in future APR research leveraging benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been fueled by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate repair systems using real issues mined from popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards-SWE-Bench Lite and Verified-have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of these two leaderboards, examining who is submitting solutions, the products behind the submissions, the LLMs employed, and the openness of the approaches. We analyze 79 entries submitted to Lite leaderboard and 133 to Verified. Our results show that most entries on both leaderboards originate from industry, particularly small companies and large publicly traded companies. These submissions often achieve top results, although academic contributions-typically open source-also remain competitive. We also find a clear dominance of proprietary LLMs, especially Claude family, with state-of-the-art results on both leaderboards currently achieved by Claude 4 Sonnet. These findings offer insights into the SWE-Bench ecosystem that can guide greater transparency and diversity in future benchmark-driven research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Current Software Engineering (SE) agents are reactive, struggling with long-horizon reasoning due to lack of persistent state and coherent understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SE agents by addressing limitations in long-term reasoning caused by reactive behavior without structured memory.

Method: The paper proposes shifting towards structured, state-aware, and execution-grounded reasoning, along with a roadmap for creating advanced SE agents.

Result: The discussion highlights how structured reasoning and feedback integration can enable SE agents to better perform real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Advancing SE agents requires incorporating persistent structure, evolving states, and execution feedback for improved reliability and coherence in reasoning.

Abstract: Software Engineering (SE) agents have shown promising abilities in supporting various SE tasks. Current SE agents remain fundamentally reactive, making decisions mainly based on conversation history and the most recent response. However, this reactive design provides no explicit structure or persistent state within the agent's memory, making long-horizon reasoning challenging. As a result, SE agents struggle to maintain a coherent understanding across reasoning steps, adapt their hypotheses as new evidence emerges, or incorporate execution feedback into the mental reasoning model of the system state.
  In this position paper, we argue that, to further advance SE agents, we need to move beyond reactive behavior toward a structured, state-aware, and execution-grounded reasoning. We outline how explicit structure, persistent and evolving state, and the integration of execution-grounded feedback can help SE agents perform more coherent and reliable reasoning in long-horizon tasks. We also provide an initial roadmap for developing next-generation SE agents that can more effectively perform real-world tasks.

Motivation: To leverage large language models (LLMs) for enhancing software engineering processes, including test scenario generation and document management.

Method: Developing agentic AI systems with specialized LLM-based agents in star topology and dedicated agents for specific document-related tasks.

Result: Demonstrated effective test scenario generation from detailed requirements and document retrieval handling multiple use cases in software development.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic AI solutions show promising capabilities, with future research directions hinted at for further advancements.

Abstract: The introduction of large language models ignited great retooling and rethinking of the software development models. The ensuing response of software engineering research yielded a massive body of tools and approaches. In this paper, we join the hassle by introducing agentic AI solutions for two tasks. First, we developed a solution for automatic test scenario generation from a detailed requirements description. This approach relies on specialized worker agents forming a star topology with the supervisor agent in the middle. We demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world example. Second, we developed an agentic AI solution for the document retrieval task in the context of software engineering documents. Our solution enables performing various use cases on a body of documents related to the development of a single software, including search, question answering, tracking changes, and large document summarization. In this case, each use case is handled by a dedicated LLM-based agent, which performs all subtasks related to the corresponding use case. We conclude by hinting at the future perspectives of our line of research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the validity of software verification tool evaluation in SV-COMP by introducing realistic benchmarks that reveal different behaviors.

Method: Introduction of the ARG-V tool to automatically generate Java benchmarks in the SV-COMP format and test them on leading Java verifiers.

Result: On the generated set of 68 benchmarks, all four leading Java verifiers showed decreased accuracy and recall compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARG-V enhances the evaluation's realism and comprehensiveness, guiding verifier improvements for real-world software applications.

Abstract: The SV-COMP competition provides a state-of-the-art platform for evaluating software verification tools on a standardized set of verification tasks. Consequently, verifier development outcomes are influenced by the composition of program benchmarks included in SV-COMP. When expanding this benchmark corpus, it is crucial to consider whether newly added programs cause verifiers to exhibit behavior distinct from that observed on existing benchmarks. Doing so helps mitigate external threats to the validity of the competition's results.
  In this paper, we present the application of the ARG-V tool for automatically generating Java verification benchmarks in the SV-COMP format. We demonstrate that, on a newly generated set of 68 realistic benchmarks, all four leading Java verifiers decrease in accuracy and recall compared to their performance on the existing benchmark suite. These findings highlight the potential of ARG-V to enhance the comprehensiveness and realism of verification tool evaluation, while also providing a roadmap for verifier developers aiming to improve their tools' applicability to real-world software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked gap between theoretical controller guarantees and their practical implementation in robotic software, ensuring consistency and reliability.

Method: Conducted an analysis of 184 real-world robot controller implementations, examining application contexts, implementation qualities, and testing practices.

Result: Found issues like ad hoc handling of discretization, poor real-time reliability, timing inconsistencies, and inadequate systematic testing/verification.

Conclusion: Current practices in controller implementation need improvement; systematic and rigorous guidelines and methodologies are essential for maintaining safety and reliability in robotic controllers.

Abstract: A controller -- a software module managing hardware behavior -- is a key component of a typical robot system. While control theory gives safety guarantees for standard controller designs, the practical implementation of controllers in software introduces complexities that are often overlooked. Controllers are often designed in continuous space, while the software is executed in discrete space, undermining some of the theoretical guarantees. Despite extensive research on control theory and control modeling, little attention has been paid to the implementations of controllers and how their theoretical guarantees are ensured in real-world software systems. We investigate 184 real-world controller implementations in open-source robot software. We examine their application context, the implementation characteristics, and the testing methods employed to ensure correctness. We find that the implementations often handle discretization in an ad hoc manner, leading to potential issues with real-time reliability. Challenges such as timing inconsistencies, lack of proper error handling, and inadequate consideration of real-time constraints further complicate matters. Testing practices are superficial, no systematic verification of theoretical guarantees is used, leaving possible inconsistencies between expected and actual behavior. Our findings highlight the need for improved implementation guidelines and rigorous verification techniques to ensure the reliability and safety of robotic controllers in practice.

*Samuel W. Flint,Robert Dyer,Bonita Sharif*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates whether developers use type annotations as in-code documentation by conducting an eye-tracking study with 26 participants working in TypeScript. Results show developers do not spend additional focus on type annotations when present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the use of statically-annotated types as in-code documentation and understand their role in aiding developers, which can inform tool design, coding standards, and education.

Method: An eye-tracking study involving 26 undergraduate students who worked on code comprehension and bug localization tasks in TypeScript. Researchers observed if and how participants focused on type annotations.

Result: Developers did not spend noticeably more time looking at lines with type annotations or type declarations, indicating limited reliance on these annotations during tasks.

Conclusion: Type annotations may not be heavily utilized for code reading tasks, which could guide improvements in tooling, type annotation standards, and educational teaching methods for better usage.

Abstract: Statically-annotated types have been shown to aid developers in a number of programming tasks, and this benefit holds true even when static type checking is not used. It is hypothesized that this is because developers use type annotations as in-code documentation. In this study, we aim to provide evidence that developers use type annotations as in-code documentation. Understanding this hypothesized use will help to understand how, and in what contexts, developers use type information; additionally, it may help to design better development tools and inform educational decisions. To provide this evidence, we conduct an eye tracking study with 26 undergraduate students to determine if they read type annotations during code comprehension and bug localization in the TypeScript language. We found that developers do not look directly at lines containing type annotations or type declarations more often when they are present, in either code summarization or bug localization tasks. The results have implications for tool builders to improve the availability of type information, the development community to build good standards for use of type annotations, and education to enforce deliberate teaching of reading patterns.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Software Engineering needs to reorient itself away from traditional code-centric approaches towards intent articulation, architectural control, and verification under AI and hardware-energy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field faces pressures from AI automation reducing costs and hardware-energy constraints increasing failure costs, resulting in accountability risks.

Method: The paper proposes redefining the discipline of software engineering to focus on intent articulation, architectural control, and systematic verification.

Result: This redefinition shifts the discipline from production-oriented processes to human judgment-centered practices.

Conclusion: Software Engineering must undergo fundamental changes in research, education, and industrial practices to address these new challenges effectively.

Abstract: Software Engineering (SE) faces simultaneous pressure from AI automation (reducing code production costs) and hardware-energy constraints (amplifying failure costs). We position that SE must redefine itself around human discernment-intent articulation, architectural control, and verification-rather than code construction. This shift introduces accountability collapse as a central risk and requires fundamental changes to research priorities, educational curricula, and industrial practices. We argue that Software Engineering, as traditionally defined around code construction and process management, is no longer sufficient. Instead, the discipline must be redefined around intent articulation, architectural control, and systematic verification. This redefinition shifts Software Engineering from a production-oriented field to one centered on human judgment under automation, with profound implications for research, practice, and education.

### [389] [A computational account of dreaming: learning and memory consolidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04095)
*Qi Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study presents a cognitive model simulating dream processes, showing random signals can contribute to memory consolidation and learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether the randomness of dreams serves intellectual functions like learning and memory consolidation.

Method: Developing and simulating a cognitive computational model that incorporates random signal activation to test dream functions.

Result: Simulation demonstrated that random signals can yield learning and memory consolidation effects.

Conclusion: Dreaming continues the brain's waking activities, processing random signals from the hippocampus, supporting intellectual functions.

Abstract: A number of studies have concluded that dreaming is mostly caused by randomly arriving internal signals because "dream contents are random impulses", and argued that dream sleep is unlikely to play an important part in our intellectual capacity. On the contrary, numerous functional studies have revealed that dream sleep does play an important role in our learning and other intellectual functions. Specifically, recent studies have suggested the importance of dream sleep in memory consolidation, following the findings of neural replaying of recent waking patterns in the hippocampus. The randomness has been the hurdle that divides dream theories into either functional or functionless. This study presents a cognitive and computational model of dream process. This model is simulated to perform the functions of learning and memory consolidation, which are two most popular dream functions that have been proposed. The simulations demonstrate that random signals may result in learning and memory consolidation. Thus, dreaming is proposed as a continuation of brain's waking activities that processes signals activated spontaneously and randomly from the hippocampus. The characteristics of the model are discussed and found in agreement with many characteristics concluded from various empirical studies.

*Jan-Matthis Lueckmann,Viren Jain,Michał Januszewski*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A study presents an in silico testbed to test mechanistic models of neural circuits using larval zebrafish simulations. LLM-based methods outperform established baselines, highlighting insights into neural modeling. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of ground truth limits verifying mechanistic models of neural circuits, which are crucial for understanding neuroscience.

Method: An in silico test environment was created with neuromechanical simulations using larval zebrafish as ground truth. LLM-based tree search methods were used to discover and test models.

Result: LLM-based models outperformed established forecasting baselines but required structural priors to ensure faithful system identification and generalization.

Conclusion: The study guides the modeling of neural recordings and provides a prototype for AI-driven scientific discovery, emphasizing the importance of structural priors.

Abstract: Constructing mechanistic models of neural circuits is a fundamental goal of neuroscience, yet verifying such models is limited by the lack of ground truth. To rigorously test model discovery, we establish an in silico testbed using neuromechanical simulations of a larval zebrafish as a transparent ground truth. We find that LLM-based tree search autonomously discovers predictive models that significantly outperform established forecasting baselines. Conditioning on sensory drive is necessary but not sufficient for faithful system identification, as models exploit statistical shortcuts. Structural priors prove essential for enabling robust out-of-distribution generalization and recovery of interpretable mechanistic models. Our insights provide guidance for modeling real-world neural recordings and offer a broader template for AI-driven scientific discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrainVista, a framework for modeling causal evolution of brain states from multimodal sensory inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results in fMRI analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling causal forward evolution in realistic brain simulations due to mismatched timescales and complex cortical topologies across multimodal input streams.

Method: Introduced BrainVista with Network-wise Tokenizers for disentangling dynamics, a Spatial Mixer Head for capturing inter-network flow, and a Stimulus-to-Brain (S2B) masking mechanism for synchronizing inputs with brain signals.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in fMRI encoding on datasets like Algonauts 2025 and CineBrain, with improved long-horizon rollout correlations by 36.0% and 33.3% over respective baselines.

Conclusion: BrainVista effectively models dynamic brain activity and neural encoding patterns, setting new performance standards in naturalistic fMRI studies.

Abstract: Naturalistic fMRI characterizes the brain as a dynamic predictive engine driven by continuous sensory streams. However, modeling the causal forward evolution in realistic neural simulation is impeded by the timescale mismatch between multimodal inputs and the complex topology of cortical networks. To address these challenges, we introduce BrainVista, a multimodal autoregressive framework designed to model the causal evolution of brain states. BrainVista incorporates Network-wise Tokenizers to disentangle system-specific dynamics and a Spatial Mixer Head that captures inter-network information flow without compromising functional boundaries. Furthermore, we propose a novel Stimulus-to-Brain (S2B) masking mechanism to synchronize high-frequency sensory stimuli with hemodynamically filtered signals, enabling strict, history-only causal conditioning. We validate our framework on Algonauts 2025, CineBrain, and HAD, achieving state-of-the-art fMRI encoding performance. In long-horizon rollout settings, our model yields substantial improvements over baselines, increasing pattern correlation by 36.0\% and 33.3\% on relative to the strongest baseline Algonauts 2025 and CineBrain, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Degeneracy in maximum likelihood estimation via EM for finite mixture models leads to components collapsing, requiring a solution for stabilization.

Method: A transcendental regularization framework with analytic barrier functions is applied to prevent degeneracy while ensuring theoretical guarantees such as identifiability, consistency, and robustness.

Result: TAMD stabilizes estimation and prevents collapse but achieves modest improvements in unsupervised learning classification accuracy, particularly for high-dimensional data.

Conclusion: TAMD addresses degeneracy in mixture models with theoretical and practical contributions while acknowledging the limitations of mixture models for high-dimensional unsupervised learning.

Abstract: Finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised learning, but maximum likelihood estimation via EM suffers from degeneracy as components collapse. We introduce transcendental regularization, a penalized likelihood framework with analytic barrier functions that prevent degeneracy while maintaining asymptotic efficiency. The resulting Transcendental Algorithm for Mixtures of Distributions (TAMD) offers strong theoretical guarantees: identifiability, consistency, and robustness. Empirically, TAMD successfully stabilizes estimation and prevents collapse, yet achieves only modest improvements in classification accuracy-highlighting fundamental limits of mixture models for unsupervised learning in high dimensions. Our work provides both a novel theoretical framework and an honest assessment of practical limitations, implemented in an open-source R package.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper compares two methods, Exponential Arrival Time (EAT) simulation and Gumbel-SoftMax (GSM) relaxation, for differentiating through Poisson-distributed latent variable models and proposes an improved EAT method for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of differentiating through discrete stochastic samples in Poisson-distributed latent variable models, which is crucial for computational neuroscience.

Method: The methods compared include EAT simulation and GSM relaxation. The authors introduce a modification to the EAT method, ensuring an unbiased first moment and reducing second-moment bias. Evaluation metrics include distributional fidelity, gradient quality, and task performance.

Result: The modified EAT method demonstrates superior performance, often comparable to exact gradients, and shows enhanced robustness to hyperparameter choices. It outperforms GSM in various aspects.

Conclusion: The study provides practitioners with a clear understanding of the trade-offs between the EAT and GSM methods and offers practical recommendations, particularly endorsing the improved EAT method for its reliability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Poisson-distributed latent variable models are widely used in computational neuroscience, but differentiating through discrete stochastic samples remains challenging. Two approaches address this: Exponential Arrival Time (EAT) simulation and Gumbel-SoftMax (GSM) relaxation. We provide the first systematic comparison of these methods, along with practical guidance for practitioners. Our main technical contribution is a modification to the EAT method that theoretically guarantees an unbiased first moment (exactly matching the firing rate), and reduces second-moment bias. We evaluate these methods on their distributional fidelity, gradient quality, and performance on two tasks: (1) variational autoencoders with Poisson latents, and (2) partially observable generalized linear models, where latent neural connectivity must be inferred from observed spike trains. Across all metrics, our modified EAT method exhibits better overall performance (often comparable to exact gradients), and substantially higher robustness to hyperparameter choices. Together, our results clarify the trade-offs between these methods and offer concrete recommendations for practitioners working with Poisson latent variable models.

*Gilles Bareilles,Wassim Bouaziz,Julien Fageot,El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper focuses on MultiKrum, a distributed learning aggregation rule, and provides the first robustness proof and bounds for it, improving upon and comparing it with the Krum rule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the lack of theoretical guarantees for MultiKrum, an aggregation rule widely used in federated learning for robustness against adversaries, despite its superior empirical performance.

Method: The authors introduce a new measure, $κ^\star$, to quantify robustness in adversarial scenarios and derive both upper and lower bounds on MultiKrum's robustness coefficient.

Result: It is proven that MultiKrum’s bounds are never worse and often better than those of Krum, with improved robustness coefficient bounds derived for both.

Conclusion: MultiKrum is a theoretically robust aggregation rule with better guarantees and performance compared to Krum, backed by tighter robustness analysis and experimental validation.

Abstract: Aggregation rules are the cornerstone of distributed (or federated) learning in the presence of adversaries, under the so-called Byzantine threat model. They are also interesting mathematical objects from the point of view of robust mean estimation. The Krum aggregation rule has been extensively studied, and endowed with formal robustness and convergence guarantees. Yet, MultiKrum, a natural extension of Krum, is often preferred in practice for its superior empirical performance, even though no theoretical guarantees were available until now. In this work, we provide the first proof that MultiKrum is a robust aggregation rule, and bound its robustness coefficient. To do so, we introduce $κ^\star$, the optimal *robustness coefficient* of an aggregation rule, which quantifies the accuracy of mean estimation in the presence of adversaries in a tighter manner compared with previously adopted notions of robustness. We then construct an upper and a lower bound on MultiKrum's robustness coefficient. As a by-product, we also improve on the best-known bounds on Krum's robustness coefficient. We show that MultiKrum's bounds are never worse than Krum's, and better in realistic regimes. We illustrate this analysis by an experimental investigation on the quality of the lower bound.

*Anastasis Kratsios,Giulia Livieri,A. Martina Neuman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reasoning probes in a Boolean circuit model structured as a perfect $;&#x3c8;$-ary tree with iterative computation. It achieves an optimal generalization error rate for graph-convolutional network-based reasoning methods under partial access conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the statistical behavior of reasoning probes in the presence of partial observability in Boolean circuit models, and to explore how structural properties influence reasoning efficiency.

Method: A graph convolutional network (GCN)-based hypothesis system is used to parameterize reasoning probes, in tandem with metric embedding techniques and statistical optimal transport methods.

Result: The reasoning approach achieves an optimal generalization error rate of $;(\sqrt{\log(2/\delta)}/\sqrt{N})$ with high probability, independent of the graph size.

Conclusion: Structural properties of computational graphs, such as low-distortion snowflake embeddings, play a significant role in achieving statistical efficiency in partial-access reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: We study the statistical behaviour of reasoning probes in a stylized model of looped reasoning, given by Boolean circuits whose computational graph is a perfect $ν$-ary tree ($ν\ge 2$) and whose output is appended to the input and fed back iteratively for subsequent computation rounds. A reasoning probe has access to a sampled subset of internal computation nodes, possibly without covering the entire graph, and seeks to infer which $ν$-ary Boolean gate is executed at each queried node, representing uncertainty via a probability distribution over a fixed collection of $\mathtt{m}$ admissible $ν$-ary gates. This partial observability induces a generalization problem, which we analyze in a realizable, transductive setting.
  We show that, when the reasoning probe is parameterized by a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based hypothesis class and queries $N$ nodes, the worst-case generalization error attains the optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log(2/δ)}/\sqrt{N})$ with probability at least $1-δ$, for $δ\in (0,1)$. Our analysis combines snowflake metric embedding techniques with tools from statistical optimal transport. A key insight is that this optimal rate is achievable independently of graph size, owing to the existence of a low-distortion one-dimensional snowflake embedding of the induced graph metric. As a consequence, our results provide a sharp characterization of how structural properties of the computational graph govern the statistical efficiency of reasoning under partial access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect individual link information in relational datasets while enabling accurate estimation of parameters, especially under differential privacy constraints.

Method: Establishing minimax lower bounds and proposing estimators that achieve these bounds (up to constants and logarithmic factors) for $β$ models under differential privacy frameworks.

Result: Characterized privacy-utility trade-offs for parameter estimation in $β$ models, extending from graphs to hypergraphs, supported by results from synthetic and real-world data experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive understanding of finite sample privacy-utility trade-offs for parameter estimation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: In sensitive applications involving relational datasets, protecting information about individual links from adversarial queries is of paramount importance. In many such settings, the available data are summarized solely through the degrees of the nodes in the network. We adopt the $β$ model, which is the prototypical statistical model adopted for this form of aggregated relational information, and study the problem of minimax-optimal parameter estimation under both local and central differential privacy constraints. We establish finite sample minimax lower bounds that characterize the precise dependence of the estimation risk on the network size and the privacy parameters, and we propose simple estimators that achieve these bounds up to constants and logarithmic factors under both local and central differential privacy frameworks. Our results provide the first comprehensive finite sample characterization of privacy utility trade offs for parameter estimation in $β$ models, addressing the classical graph case and extending the analysis to higher order hypergraph models. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic data and a real world communication network.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a three-stage framework for inferring network topology, interaction kernels, and type assignments in particle systems, supported by theoretical guarantees and robust experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging task of understanding heterogeneous interacting particle systems by inferring their complex dynamics from multi-trajectory data.

Method: The framework includes: (1) leveraging matrix sensing to embed system parameters, (2) clustering in the learned embedding to identify interaction types, and (3) using matrix factorization and refinement to reconstruct network weights and kernel coefficients.

Result: The approach achieves theoretical guarantees (error bounds and type recovery conditions) and demonstrates accurate reconstruction in synthetic experiments, including predator-prey systems, even under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The framework is effective in recovering dynamics of heterogeneous systems, supported by error analyses and robustness, advancing understanding in particle systems modeling.

Abstract: We propose a framework for the joint inference of network topology, multi-type interaction kernels, and latent type assignments in heterogeneous interacting particle systems from multi-trajectory data. This learning task is a challenging non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem, which we address through a novel three-stage approach. First, we leverage shared structure across agent interactions to recover a low-rank embedding of the system parameters via matrix sensing. Second, we identify discrete interaction types by clustering within the learned embedding. Third, we recover the network weight matrix and kernel coefficients through matrix factorization and a post-processing refinement. We provide theoretical guarantees with estimation error bounds under a Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) assumption and establish conditions for the exact recovery of interaction types based on cluster separability. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets, including heterogeneous predator-prey systems, demonstrate that our method yields an accurate reconstruction of the underlying dynamics and is robust to noise.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the relationship between fixed-budget (FB) and fixed-confidence (FC) settings in the best-arm identification (BAI) problem, showing that FB is no harder than FC up to logarithmic factors via a novel algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In BAI problems, understanding whether the fixed-budget (FB) setting is harder than the fixed-confidence (FC) setting (or vice versa) is an open question with both theoretical and practical implications.

Method: The authors propose a meta-algorithm called FC2FB, which transforms any FC algorithm into an FB algorithm, with provable guarantees on sample complexity aligning with the FC algorithm, up to logarithmic factors.

Result: The FC2FB algorithm demonstrates that the sample complexity of the FB setting is upper-bounded by that of the FC setting up to logarithmic factors, bridging the gap between FB and FC settings.

Conclusion: This work establishes a fundamental relationship between FB and FC settings in BAI problems and provides a method to improve sample complexity in FB problems using state-of-the-art FC algorithms.

Abstract: The best-arm identification (BAI) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in interactive machine learning, which has two flavors: the fixed-budget setting (FB) and the fixed-confidence setting (FC).
  For $K$-armed bandits with the unique best arm, the optimal sample complexities for both settings have been settled down, and they match up to logarithmic factors.
  This prompts an interesting research question about the generic, potentially structured BAI problems: Is FB harder than FC or the other way around?
  In this paper, we show that FB is no harder than FC up to logarithmic factors.
  We do this constructively: we propose a novel algorithm called FC2FB (fixed confidence to fixed budget), which is a meta algorithm that takes in an FC algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ and turn it into an FB algorithm.
  We prove that this FC2FB enjoys a sample complexity that matches, up to logarithmic factors, that of the sample complexity of $\mathcal{A}$.
  This means that the optimal FC sample complexity is an upper bound of the optimal FB sample complexity up to logarithmic factors.
  Our result not only reveals a fundamental relationship between FB and FC, but also has a significant implication: FC2FB, combined with existing state-of-the-art FC algorithms, leads to improved sample complexity for a number of FB problems.

*Zhongming Xie,Joseph Giorgio,Jingshen Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fused optimal causal tree method for subgroup analysis in precision health, addressing limitations in traditional tree-based methods using mixed integer optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve precision health by addressing the challenges of identifying differential treatment effects and solving limitations in existing subgroup analysis methods, particularly for small sample sizes.

Method: The paper proposes a fused optimal causal tree approach that uses mixed integer optimization (MIO) for globally optimal partitions and introduces a fusion constraint for better information sharing across subgroups.

Result: The proposed method provides superior subgroup discovery accuracy, enhanced statistical efficiency, and outperforms baseline methods in simulations.

Conclusion: The fused optimal causal tree method demonstrates practical utility, providing clinically meaningful insights, as evidenced by the application on the Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities dataset.

Abstract: Identifying and making statistical inferences on differential treatment effects (commonly known as subgroup analysis in clinical research) is central to precision health. Subgroup analysis allows practitioners to pinpoint populations for whom a treatment is especially beneficial or protective, thereby advancing targeted interventions. Tree based recursive partitioning methods are widely used for subgroup analysis due to their interpretability. Nevertheless, these approaches encounter significant limitations, including suboptimal partitions induced by greedy heuristics and overfitting from locally estimated splits, especially under limited sample sizes. To address these limitations, we propose a fused optimal causal tree method that leverages mixed integer optimization (MIO) to facilitate precise subgroup identification. Our approach ensures globally optimal partitions and introduces a parameter fusion constraint to facilitate information sharing across related subgroups. This design substantially improves subgroup discovery accuracy and enhances statistical efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees by rigorously establishing out of sample risk bounds and comparing them with those of classical tree based methods. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms popular baselines in simulations. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility through a case study on the Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS-HD) dataset, where our approach yields clinically meaningful insights.

### [400] [Attack-Resistant Uniform Fairness for Linear and Smooth Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04125)
*Qingwen Zhang,Wenjia Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness and vulnerability to manipulation in contextual bandits, proposing robust algorithms with optimal regret bounds under fairness constraints and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying contextual bandits in online decision-making can lead to unfair exposure among arms, undermining the platform’s long-term sustainability and trust.

Method: The authors introduce algorithms achieving minimax-optimal regret under fairness constraints and develop adaptive methods to counter adversarial attacks that exploit fairness.

Result: The proposed algorithms maintain both optimal fairness and performance even under budget-constrained adversarial attacks, validated by theoretical analysis and experiments.

Conclusion: Maintaining fairness requires robust designs to counter fairness-specific vulnerabilities, ensuring sustainable and trustworthy platform operations.

Abstract: Modern systems, such as digital platforms and service systems, increasingly rely on contextual bandits for online decision-making; however, their deployment can inadvertently create unfair exposure among arms, undermining long-term platform sustainability and supplier trust. This paper studies the contextual bandit problem under a uniform $(1-δ)$-fairness constraint, and addresses its unique vulnerabilities to strategic manipulation. The fairness constraint ensures that preferential treatment is strictly justified by an arm's actual reward across all contexts and time horizons, using uniformity to prevent statistical loopholes. We develop novel algorithms that achieve (nearly) minimax-optimal regret for both linear and smooth reward functions, while maintaining strong $(1-\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness guarantees, and further characterize the theoretically inherent yet asymptotically marginal "price of fairness". However, we reveal that such merit-based fairness becomes uniquely susceptible to signal manipulation. We show that an adversary with a minimal $\tilde{O}(1)$ budget can not only degrade overall performance as in traditional attacks, but also selectively induce insidious fairness-specific failures while leaving conspicuous regret measures largely unaffected. To counter this, we design robust variants incorporating corruption-adaptive exploration and error-compensated thresholding. Our approach yields the first minimax-optimal regret bounds under $C$-budgeted attack while preserving $(1-\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness. Numerical experiments and a real-world case demonstrate that our algorithms sustain both fairness and efficiency.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper adopts a game-theoretic approach to group fairness, using relative improvement to balance diverging metrics among subpopulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness in predictors deployed across subpopulations by redefining it as a bargaining process that allows better equitable outcomes.

Method: Utilizes the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution with the concept 'relative improvement,' ensuring scale invariance and monotonicity in fairness, supported with convergence guarantees.

Result: Introduces a new fairness metric, relative improvement, which is well-grounded in axioms and compares favorably to traditional fairness metrics in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Relative improvement effectively overcomes the limitations of absolute methods, ensuring equitable prediction under varying subpopulation predictability.

Abstract: When deploying a single predictor across multiple subpopulations, we propose a fundamentally different approach: interpreting group fairness as a bargaining problem among subpopulations. This game-theoretic perspective reveals that existing robust optimization methods such as minimizing worst-group loss or regret correspond to classical bargaining solutions and embody different fairness principles. We propose relative improvement, the ratio of actual risk reduction to potential reduction from a baseline predictor, which recovers the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. Unlike absolute-scale methods that may not be comparable when groups have different potential predictability, relative improvement provides axiomatic justification including scale invariance and individual monotonicity. We establish finite-sample convergence guarantees under mild conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical studies fail to explain why larger pre-trained models significantly reduce the sample complexity of downstream learning, as observed empirically.

Method: Introduced a novel theoretical framework called 'caulking,' inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like adapter-based fine-tuning, low-rank adaptation, and partial fine-tuning.

Result: The framework shows that improved pre-trained models provably decrease the sample complexity of downstream tasks, aligning with empirical scaling laws.

Conclusion: The study offers a theoretical basis for the scaling laws relating pre-trained model size to downstream performance, advancing the understanding of pre-trained models' efficacy.

Abstract: Pre-trained models have become indispensable for efficiently building models across a broad spectrum of downstream tasks. The advantages of pre-trained models have been highlighted by empirical studies on scaling laws, which demonstrate that larger pre-trained models can significantly reduce the sample complexity of downstream learning. However, existing theoretical investigations of pre-trained models lack the capability to explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a theoretical investigation by introducing a novel framework, caulking, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as adapter-based fine-tuning, low-rank adaptation, and partial fine-tuning. Our analysis establishes that improved pre-trained models provably decrease the sample complexity of downstream tasks, thereby offering theoretical justification for the empirically observed scaling laws relating pre-trained model size to downstream performance, a relationship not covered by existing results.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Authors propose novel estimators for sampling error and intrinsic dimensionality in Optimal Transport (OT) without requiring an OT solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discretization error bottleneck in large-scale OT problems caused by the dependency on data's intrinsic dimension and sampling error.

Method: Introduced a tuning-free semi-dual OT functional estimator and a multi-scale decay-based intrinsic dimension estimator to estimate error and adapt geometry-aware computations.

Result: Achieved accurate quantification of discretization error convergence, better calibration of Sinkhorn divergence with intrinsic geometry, and a debiased Wasserstein estimation through Richardson extrapolation.

Conclusion: The approach minimizes discretization errors and improves statistical and computational efficiency in large-scale OT problems.

Abstract: Solving large scale Optimal Transport (OT) in machine learning typically relies on sampling measures to obtain a tractable discrete problem. While the discrete solver's accuracy is controllable, the rate of convergence of the discretization error is governed by the intrinsic dimension of our data. Therefore, the true bottleneck is the knowledge and control of the sampling error. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing novel estimators for both sampling error and intrinsic dimension. The key finding is a simple, tuning-free estimator of $\text{OT}_c(ρ, \hatρ)$ that utilizes the semi-dual OT functional and, remarkably, requires no OT solver. Furthermore, we derive a fast intrinsic dimension estimator from the multi-scale decay of our sampling error estimator. This framework unlocks significant computational and statistical advantages in practice, enabling us to (i) quantify the convergence rate of the discretization error, (ii) calibrate the entropic regularization of Sinkhorn divergences to the data's intrinsic geometry, and (iii) introduce a novel, intrinsic-dimension-based Richardson extrapolation estimator that strongly debiases Wasserstein distance estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our geometry-aware pipeline effectively mitigates the discretization error bottleneck while maintaining computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of providing adaptive, individualized practice to large and diverse groups of learners in digital educational settings.

Method: A framework that selects exercises to maximize learners' skill development using data on their performance and learning progress, validated using an online mathematics tutoring platform.

Result: The proposed method identified exercises improving skill levels significantly and effectively adapted to diverse learner needs.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable personalized practice, identifies impactful exercises, and assists instructors in supporting struggling learners.

Abstract: In recent years, instructional practices in Operations Research (OR), Management Science (MS), and Analytics have increasingly shifted toward digital environments, where large and diverse groups of learners make it difficult to provide practice that adapts to individual needs. This paper introduces a method that generates personalized sequences of exercises by selecting, at each step, the exercise most likely to advance a learner's understanding of a targeted skill. The method uses information about the learner and their past performance to guide these choices, and learning progress is measured as the change in estimated skill level before and after each exercise. Using data from an online mathematics tutoring platform, we find that the approach recommends exercises associated with greater skill improvement and adapts effectively to differences across learners. From an instructional perspective, the framework enables personalized practice at scale, highlights exercises with consistently strong learning value, and helps instructors identify learners who may benefit from additional support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of existing conformal prediction and risk control methods that only ensure error control on average over fixed-size calibration datasets.

Method: The authors use quantile-based arguments to extend prediction set guarantees across growing calibration datasets, ensuring high probability validity.

Result: The paper establishes theoretical guarantees for the proposed method, deriving a matching lower bound and asymptotic tightness. Practical performance is demonstrated using simulations and real-world examples.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves prediction set methodologies by providing robust error control across dynamically growing datasets, ensuring broader applicability, especially under distribution shift conditions.

Abstract: Prediction sets provide a means of quantifying the uncertainty in predictive tasks. Using held out calibration data, conformal prediction and risk control can produce prediction sets that exhibit statistically valid error control in a computationally efficient manner. However, in the standard formulations, the error is only controlled on average over many possible calibration datasets of fixed size. In this paper, we extend the control to remain valid with high probability over a cumulatively growing calibration dataset at any time point. We derive such guarantees using quantile-based arguments and illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework to settings involving distribution shift. We further establish a matching lower bound and show that our guarantees are asymptotically tight. Finally, we demonstrate the practical performance of our methods through both simulations and real-world numerical examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address how performative predictions, which affect sample or population outcomes, impact model generalization in forecasting scenarios.

Method: The authors embed performative predictions into statistical learning theory, proving generalization bounds using min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space and analyzing trade-offs.

Result: The study provides theoretical bounds and insights, revealing that models influencing data performatively learn less from it. Retraining on distorted samples can improve generalization guarantees.

Conclusion: Performative predictions fundamentally limit generalization, but careful retraining can alleviate these effects. The findings are supported by a case study on German labor market records.

Abstract: Performative predictions influence the very outcomes they aim to forecast. We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the traditional PINNs by integrating prior knowledge and enabling uncertainty quantification for solving linear inverse problems.

Method: Developed a Bayesian variation of PINNs called BPINN-IP, integrating variational inference and Monte Carlo dropout for handling uncertainties and providing predictive metrics.

Result: Implemented the methodology on applications like deconvolution and super-resolution and showed preliminary outcomes with implementation details provided.

Conclusion: The proposed BPINN-IP framework enhances traditional PINNs with Bayesian features that allow for better predictive accuracies and uncertainty quantification in linear inverse problems.

Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is to develop a hierarchical Bayesian formulation of PINNs for linear inverse problems, which is called BPINN-IP. The proposed methodology extends PINN to account for prior knowledge on the nature of the expected NN output, as well as its weights. Also, as we can have access to the posterior probability distributions, naturally uncertainties can be quantified. Also, variational inference and Monte Carlo dropout are employed to provide predictive means and variances for reconstructed images. Un example of applications to deconvolution and super-resolution is considered, details of the different steps of implementations are given, and some preliminary results are presented.

### [408] [A principled framework for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04596)
*Sandra Fortini,Kenyon Ng,Sonia Petrone,Judith Rousseau,Susan Wei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: TabPFN is a transformer used in tabular tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This paper addresses uncertainty decomposition by proposing a Bayesian predictive inference framework with a predictive CLT under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While TabPFN demonstrates strong performance, a method for capturing uncertainty decomposition is lacking, which hinders insights into its predictions and confidence.

Method: The paper introduces a framework using Bayesian predictive inference and proves a predictive Central Limit Theorem (CLT) under quasi-martingale conditions. They derive fast computations for credible bands and entropy-based classification uncertainty decomposition.

Result: The proposed credible bands effectively target epistemic uncertainty and show near-nominal frequentist coverage. The framework also achieves practical uncertainty decomposition for classification using entropy-based metrics.

Conclusion: Results demonstrate improved understanding and reliable measures of uncertainty within TabPFN, enhancing its predictive utility in tabular learning tasks.

Abstract: TabPFN is a transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance on supervised tabular tasks by amortizing Bayesian prediction into a single forward pass. However, there is currently no method for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN. Because it behaves, in an idealised limit, as a Bayesian in-context learner, we cast the decomposition challenge as a Bayesian predictive inference (BPI) problem. The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions. We derive variance estimators determined by the volatility of predictive updates along the context. The resulting credible bands are fast to compute, target epistemic uncertainty, and achieve near-nominal frequentist coverage. For classification, we further obtain an entropy-based uncertainty decomposition.

*Yuxin Wang,Dennis Frauen,Emil Javurek,Konstantin Hess,Yuchen Ma,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Targeted Synthetic Control (TSC) method to improve the estimation of causal effects in panel data by refining weights and avoiding biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the limitations of SCM, such as potential biases and instability in weight estimation, and enhancing the interpretability for better counterfactual analysis.

Method: Development of a two-stage TSC estimator, involving an initial synthetic control weight calculation followed by targeted weight refinement using weight-tilting submodels.

Result: TSC shows consistent improvement in estimation accuracy over current SCM methods through simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: TSC provides a robust and interpretable framework addressing previous SCM limitations, offering enhanced applicability and better causal inference analysis.

Abstract: The synthetic control method (SCM) estimates causal effects in panel data with a single-treated unit by constructing a counterfactual outcome as a weighted combination of untreated control units that matches the pre-treatment trajectory. In this paper, we introduce the targeted synthetic control (TSC) method, a new two-stage estimator that directly estimates the counterfactual outcome. Specifically, our TSC method (1) yields a targeted debiasing estimator, in the sense that the targeted updating refines the initial weights to produce more stable weights; and (2) ensures that the final counterfactual estimation is a convex combination of observed control outcomes to enable direct interpretation of the synthetic control weights. TSC is flexible and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models. Methodologically, TSC starts from an initial set of synthetic-control weights via a one-dimensional targeted update through the weight-tilting submodel, which calibrates the weights to reduce bias of weights estimation arising from pre-treatment fit. Furthermore, TSC avoids key shortcomings of existing methods (e.g., the augmented SCM), which can produce unbounded counterfactual estimates. Across extensive synthetic and real-world experiments, TSC consistently improves estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art SCM baselines.

*Philipp Alexander Schwarz,Johannes Oberpriller,Sven Klaassen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends a causal root-cause analysis method to handle time-dependent systems, employing two truncation methods to manage dependencies and testing its approach on a factory energy management problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of root-cause analysis in systems with instantaneous and delayed effects, especially in energy systems with memory-like behavior.

Method: Adapts an existing root-cause method to time-dependent systems and introduces two truncation methods for infinite dependency graphs, while benchmarking them with factory energy management simulations.

Result: Successfully localizes root-causes in both feature and time domains, while also evaluating the impact of mechanism approximation.

Conclusion: The extended method demonstrates effectiveness in handling complex, time-dependent systems for causal analysis, though improvements in mechanism understanding are discussed.

Abstract: Root-cause analysis in controlled time dependent systems poses a major challenge in applications. Especially energy systems are difficult to handle as they exhibit instantaneous as well as delayed effects and if equipped with storage, do have a memory. In this paper we adapt the causal root-cause analysis method of Budhathoki et al. [2022] to general time-dependent systems, as it can be regarded as a strictly causal definition of the term "root-cause". Particularly, we discuss two truncation approaches to handle the infinite dependency graphs present in time-dependent systems. While one leaves the causal mechanisms intact, the other approximates the mechanisms at the start nodes. The effectiveness of the different approaches is benchmarked using a challenging data generation process inspired by a problem in factory energy management: the avoidance of peaks in the power consumption. We show that given enough lags our extension is able to localize the root-causes in the feature and time domain. Further the effect of mechanism approximation is discussed.

*Thatchanon Anancharoenkij,Donlapark Ponnoprat*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conditional Counterfactual Mean Embeddings (CCME) for understanding heterogeneous treatment effects by embedding conditional distributions of counterfactual outcomes into an RKHS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fully characterize the heterogeneous treatment effects by analyzing the complete conditional distribution of potential outcomes.

Method: The authors propose CCME, a framework utilizing a two-stage meta-estimator in the RKHS setting and develop three estimators: Ridge Regression, Deep Feature, and Neural-Kernel estimators.

Result: The proposed estimators effectively recover distributional features, including multimodal structures, with finite-sample convergence rates and double robustness property.

Conclusion: The CCME framework provides a robust and practical approach for analyzing conditional counterfactual distributions, offering accurate and detailed insights into treatment effects.

Abstract: A complete understanding of heterogeneous treatment effects involves characterizing the full conditional distribution of potential outcomes. To this end, we propose the Conditional Counterfactual Mean Embeddings (CCME), a framework that embeds conditional distributions of counterfactual outcomes into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Under this framework, we develop a two-stage meta-estimator for CCME that accommodates any RKHS-valued regression in each stage. Based on this meta-estimator, we develop three practical CCME estimators: (1) Ridge Regression estimator, (2) Deep Feature estimator that parameterizes the feature map by a neural network, and (3) Neural-Kernel estimator that performs RKHS-valued regression, with the coefficients parameterized by a neural network. We provide finite-sample convergence rates for all estimators, establishing that they possess the double robustness property. Our experiments demonstrate that our estimators accurately recover distributional features including multimodal structure of conditional counterfactual distributions.

*Nicholas Barnfield,Subhabrata Sen,Pragya Sur*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores the mechanisms of in-context learning for multi-modal data, proposing a novel cross-attention mechanism that achieves Bayes-optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has focused on unimodal data, leaving the theoretical understanding of multi-modal in-context learning unexplored.

Method: The paper introduces a latent factor model to study multi-modal learning, analyzes limitations of linear self-attention, and designs a linearized cross-attention mechanism optimized by gradient flow.

Result: The linearized cross-attention mechanism is proven to be Bayes optimal in multi-modal contexts, highlighting the importance of deep architectures.

Conclusion: Depth and cross-attention significantly enhance in-context learning for multi-modal data, providing a theoretical foundation for better model design.

Abstract: Recent progress has rapidly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying in-context learning in modern attention-based neural networks. However, existing results focus exclusively on unimodal data; in contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning for multi-modal data remain poorly understood. We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the labor-intensive and semantically inconsistent process of generating academic presentation content from scientific papers.

Method: The authors develop PaperX, employing the Scholar DAG as an intermediate representation to decouple paper structure from presentation syntax and using adaptive graph traversal strategies.

Result: PaperX achieves state-of-the-art performance in content fidelity and aesthetic quality, while improving cost efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: PaperX offers a transformative approach to multimodal presentation content generation, enabling high-quality outputs and reducing redundancy, paving the way for efficient research dissemination.

Abstract: Transforming scientific papers into multimodal presentation content is essential for research dissemination but remains labor intensive. Existing automated solutions typically treat each format as an isolated downstream task, leading to redundant processing and semantic inconsistency. We introduce PaperX, a unified framework that models academic presentation generation as a structural transformation and rendering process. Central to our approach is the Scholar DAG, an intermediate representation that decouples the paper's logical structure from its final presentation syntax. By applying adaptive graph traversal strategies, PaperX generates diverse, high quality outputs from a single source. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves the state of the art performance in content fidelity and aesthetic quality while significantly improving cost efficiency compared to specialized single task agents.

*Francisco Ferreira da Silva,Stephanie Wehner*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how quantum entanglement can enhance distributed system coordination by improving task throughput and reducing latency, demonstrating its advantages over classical non-entangled strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome communication latency challenges in distributed systems by leveraging quantum entanglement for improved task coordination and performance.

Method: An analytical and computational approach combining queueing-theory, game-theory, and classical bound certifications, applied to a two-server optimization problem under entanglement-assisted strategies.

Result: Entanglement-assisted strategies yield Pareto-superior performance in task throughput and customer wait time, surpassing the best classical coordination strategies without communication.

Conclusion: Quantum entanglement introduces a significant performance benefit in distributed scheduling tasks and coordination, identifying a potential practical application for quantum networks.

Abstract: Coordination in distributed systems is often hampered by communication latency, which degrades performance. Quantum entanglement offers fundamentally stronger correlations than classically achievable without communication. Crucially, these correlations manifest instantaneously upon measurement, irrespective of the physical distance separating the systems. We investigate the application of shared entanglement to a dual-work optimization problem in a distributed system comprising two servers. The system must process both a continuously available, preemptible baseline task and incoming customer requests arriving in pairs. System performance is characterized by the trade-off between baseline task throughput and customer waiting time. We present a rigorous analytical model demonstrating that when the baseline task throughput function is strictly convex, rewarding longer uninterrupted processing periods, entanglement-assisted routing strategies achieve Pareto-superior performance compared to optimal communication-free classical strategies. We prove this advantage through queueing-theoretic analysis, non-local game formulation, and computational certification of classical bounds. Our results identify distributed scheduling and coordination as a novel application domain for near-term entanglement-based quantum networks.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study analyzes how large language models are reshaping AI research patterns using arXiv dataset, showing increased academic publications but limited academic-industry collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand structural shifts in the AI research landscape, particularly in publication trends and collaboration post-LLMs introduction.

Method: Data analysis using arXiv preprints, multi-stage data pipelines, and LLM-based classification to track research volume, team sizes, and collaboration patterns.

Result: An unprecedented surge in publications post-ChatGPT introduction; academic output dominates while academic-industry collaboration remains limited.

Conclusion: Generative AI research's resource demands may isolate academic-industry partnerships, highlighting structural divides in the scientific collaboration ecosystem.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) represents a significant technological shift within the scientific ecosystem, particularly within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper examines structural changes in the AI research landscape using a dataset of arXiv preprints (cs.AI) from 2021 through 2025. Given the rapid pace of AI development, the preprint ecosystem has become a critical barometer for real-time scientific shifts, often preceding formal peer-reviewed publication by months or years. By employing a multi-stage data collection and enrichment pipeline in conjunction with LLM-based institution classification, we analyze the evolution of publication volumes, author team sizes, and academic--industry collaboration patterns. Our results reveal an unprecedented surge in publication output following the introduction of ChatGPT, with academic institutions continuing to provide the largest volume of research. However, we observe that academic--industry collaboration is still suppressed, as measured by a Normalized Collaboration Index (NCI) that remains significantly below the random-mixing baseline across all major subfields. These findings highlight a continuing institutional divide and suggest that the capital-intensive nature of generative AI research may be reshaping the boundaries of scientific collaboration.

*Florian Kramer,Henrich R. Greve,Moritz von Zahn,Hayagreeva Rao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper studies key actors spreading conspiracy theories on social media -- Human Superspreaders and Bots -- analyzing their behavior. It proposes methods to identify these actors and recommends measures to mitigate conspiracy theory dissemination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant societal harm caused by conspiracy theories—including misinformation, polarization, and erosion of democratic trust—fueled by social media actors like Superspreaders and Bots.

Method: Approximately 7 million tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed to identify behavioral differences between Human Superspreaders and Bots across parameters like language complexity, toxicity, and hashtag usage. The study also proposed 27 metrics to assess conspiracy theory severity and evaluated these metrics.

Result: Superspreaders employ complex language and substantive content for credibility, while Bots use simpler language and strategic hashtagging to aid accessibility and reach. A modified H-Index showed promise in identifying Human Superspreaders efficiently.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights into distinguishing between Superspreaders and Bots, offering targeted tools and recommendations for combating conspiracy theories via moderation, account suspensions, and public campaigns.

Abstract: Conspiracy theories can threaten society by spreading misinformation, deepening polarization, and eroding trust in democratic institutions. Social media often fuels the spread of conspiracies, primarily driven by two key actors: Superspreaders -- influential individuals disseminating conspiracy content at disproportionately high rates, and Bots -- automated accounts designed to amplify conspiracies strategically. To counter the spread of conspiracy theories, it is critical to both identify these actors and to better understand their behavior. However, a systematic analysis of these actors as well as real-world-applicable identification methods are still lacking. In this study, we leverage over seven million tweets from the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze key differences between Human Superspreaders and Bots across dimensions such as linguistic complexity, toxicity, and hashtag usage. Our analysis reveals distinct communication strategies: Superspreaders tend to use more complex language and substantive content while relying less on structural elements like hashtags and emojis, likely to enhance credibility and authority. By contrast, Bots favor simpler language and strategic cross-usage of hashtags, likely to increase accessibility, facilitate infiltration into trending discussions, and amplify reach. To counter both Human Superspreaders and Bots, we propose and evaluate 27 novel metrics for quantifying the severity of conspiracy theory spread. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of an adapted H-Index for computationally feasible identification of Human Superspreaders. By identifying behavioral patterns unique to Human Superspreaders and Bots as well as providing suitable identification methods, this study provides a foundation for mitigation strategies, including platform moderation policies, temporary and permanent account suspensions, and public awareness campaigns.

*Eun Cheol Choi,Lindsay E. Young,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to replicate human patterns of belief and sharing of misinformation through simulated survey responses, finding both successes in capturing general tendencies and systematic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the growing use of LLMs as proxies in computational social science, particularly in human judgment-related tasks, and the need to determine their effectiveness in replicating susceptibility to misinformation.

Method: The paper tests LLMs by simulating survey responses using participant profiles from real survey data and comparing the outputs to three online survey baselines, evaluating distributional alignment, feature-association recovery, and reasoning behind responses.

Result: LLM responses align with broad distributional trends and modestly correlate with human responses but exaggerate associations between belief and sharing. Additionally, LLMs place overemphasis on attitudinal and behavioral features while neglecting personal network factors.

Conclusion: LLM-based survey simulations are better for identifying systematic discrepancies from human judgment rather than substituting for human responses outright, due to biases in misinformation-related concept representation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human judgment in computational social science, yet their ability to reproduce patterns of susceptibility to misinformation remains unclear. We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses. Analyses of model-generated reasoning and LLM training data suggest that these distortions reflect systematic biases in how misinformation-related concepts are represented. Our findings suggest that LLM-based survey simulations are better suited for diagnosing systematic divergences from human judgment than for substituting it.

TL;DR: This paper presents advancements in GPU-accelerated gyrokinetic simulations using TRIMEG code for plasma physics, optimizing computational efficiency for tokamak studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plasma physics requires computationally intensive simulations to study complex phenomena, and improving the efficiency of these simulations is crucial for the design and interpretation of experiments, particularly in tokamak geometries.

Method: The TRIangular MEsh based Gyrokinetic (TRIMEG) code was enhanced to perform GPU-accelerated simulations using the OpenMP API for portability across different GPU architectures. Key code components were adapted for GPU compatibility, and performance analyses were conducted to ensure efficiency.

Result: The GPU-accelerated version showed significant speedups compared to the CPU-only version. The Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) mode simulation validated the accuracy of energy growth rates and 2D mode structures.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration with OpenMP API enhanced TRIMEG's computational performance, enabling high-accuracy plasma simulations, which can contribute to better experimental designs and scientific discoveries in plasma physics.

Abstract: The field of plasma physics heavily relies on simulations to model various phenomena, such as instabilities, turbulence, and nonlinear behaviors that would otherwise be difficult to study from a purely theoretical approach. Simulations are fundamental in accurately setting up experiments, which can be extremely costly and complex. As high-fidelity tools, gyrokinetic simulations play a crucial role in discovering new physics, interpreting experimental results, and improving the design of next-generation devices. However, their high computational costs necessitate the use of acceleration platforms to reduce execution time. This work revolves around the TRIangular MEsh based Gyrokinetic (TRIMEG) code, which performs high-accuracy particle-in-cell plasma simulations in tokamak geometries, leveraging a novel finite element approach. The rise of graphical processing units (GPUs) constitutes an occasion to satisfy such computational needs, by offloading the most expensive portion of the code to the accelerators. The chosen approach features GPU offloading with the OpenMP API, which grants portability of the code to different architectures, namely AMD and NVIDIA. The particle pushing as well as the grid-to-particle operations have been ported to GPU platforms. Compiler limitations had to be overcome, and portions of the code were restructured to be suitable for GPU acceleration. Kernel performance was evaluated by carrying out GPU grid size exploration, as well as scalability studies. In addition, the efficiency of hybrid MPI-OpenMP offloading parallelization was assessed. The speedup of the GPU implementation was calculated by comparing it with the pure CPU version using different rationales. The Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) mode was simulated using the GPU-accelerated version, and its correctness was verified in terms of the energy growth rate and the two-dimensional mode structures.

*Peiwen Jiang,Takuo Matsubara,Minh-Ngoc Tran*

TL;DR: The paper proposes optimizing the Importance-Weighted Evidence Lower Bound (IW-ELBO) using a Bures-Wasserstein gradient approach to address inefficiencies and stability issues with traditional Euclidean methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the optimization efficiency and stability of the IW-ELBO in variational inference, especially addressing the vanishing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prevalent in Euclidean space methods.

Method: The paper derives a Wasserstein gradient of the IW-ELBO, projects it onto the Bures-Wasserstein space, and provides a tractable algorithm for Gaussian variational inference.

Result: The SNR of the proposed Wasserstein gradient scales favourably with an $Ω(√K)$ rate, making it efficient for large importance sample sizes. The framework also generalizes to other objectives and outperforms baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: Optimizing IW-ELBO in Bures-Wasserstein space results in improved stability and performance for variational inference tasks, demonstrating the potential of geometric approaches.

Abstract: The Importance-Weighted Evidence Lower Bound (IW-ELBO) has emerged as an effective objective for variational inference (VI), tightening the standard ELBO and mitigating the mode-seeking behaviour.
  However, optimizing the IW-ELBO in Euclidean space is often inefficient, as its gradient estimators suffer from a vanishing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This paper formulates the optimisation of the IW-ELBO in Bures-Wasserstein space, a manifold of Gaussian distributions equipped with the 2-Wasserstein metric. We derive the Wasserstein gradient of the IW-ELBO and project it onto the Bures-Wasserstein space to yield a tractable algorithm for Gaussian VI.
  A pivotal contribution of our analysis concerns the stability of the gradient estimator. While the SNR of the standard Euclidean gradient estimator is known to vanish as the number of importance samples $K$ increases, we prove that the SNR of the Wasserstein gradient scales favourably as $Ω(\sqrt{K})$, ensuring optimisation efficiency even for large $K$. We further extend this geometric analysis to the Variational Rényi Importance-Weighted Autoencoder bound, establishing analogous stability guarantees. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior approximation performance compared to other baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of von Neumann architectures in terms of speed and energy efficiency, and to exploit the advantages of photonics for neuromorphic computation.

Method: Introduced a photonic PNN architecture with local optical feedback implementing a Hebbian learning rule via non-volatile phase-change material synapses, demonstrated experimentally on letter recognition.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated a 100% recognition rate on a non-trivial letter recognition task using an all-optical fiber-optic system.

Conclusion: The work opens possibilities for highly efficient, real-time optical computing, removing the need for optical-electrical-optical conversions, paving the way for advanced AI applications.

Abstract: While software implementations of neural networks have driven significant advances in computation, the von Neumann architecture imposes fundamental limitations on speed and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic networks, with structures inspired by the brain's architecture, offer a compelling solution with the potential to approach the extreme energy efficiency of neurobiological systems. Photonic neuromorphic networks (PNNs) are particularly attractive because they leverage the inherent advantages of light, namely high parallelism, low latency, and exceptional energy efficiency. Previous PNN demonstrations have largely focused on device-level functionalities or system-level implementations reliant on supervised learning and inefficient optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. Here, we introduce a purely photonic deep PNN architecture that enables online, unsupervised learning. We propose a local feedback mechanism operating entirely in the optical domain that implements a Hebbian learning rule using non-volatile phase-change material synapses. We experimentally demonstrate this approach on a non-trivial letter recognition task using a commercially available fiber-optic platform and achieve a 100 percent recognition rate, showcasing an all-optical solution for efficient, real-time information processing. This work unlocks the potential of photonic computing for complex artificial intelligence applications by enabling direct, high-throughput processing of optical information without intermediate OEO signal conversions.

*Wenbin Zhou,Liyan Xie,Shixiang Zhu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework for change-point detection in spatio-temporal point processes, offering both the time and location of distributional changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for change-point detection in spatio-temporal data primarily focus on temporal changes and ignore spatial-localization aspects, which limits their practicality for real-world applications.

Method: A likelihood-free, score-based framework using Hyvärinen scores and a spatio-temporal CUSUM statistic to estimate both change time and affected spatial regions sequentially.

Result: The proposed method achieves false-alarm control, minimal detection delays, and effective spatial localization, validated through simulations and real-world data.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates real-time, interpretable change-point detection in space-time settings and provides strong theoretical performance guarantees.

Abstract: We study sequential change-point detection for spatio-temporal point processes, where actionable detection requires not only identifying when a distributional change occurs but also localizing where it manifests in space. While classical quickest change detection methods provide strong guarantees on detection delay and false-alarm rates, existing approaches for point-process data predominantly focus on temporal changes and do not explicitly infer affected spatial regions. We propose a likelihood-free, score-based detection framework that jointly estimates the change time and the change region in continuous space-time without assuming parametric knowledge of the pre- or post-change dynamics. The method leverages a localized and conditionally weighted Hyvärinen score to quantify event-level deviations from nominal behavior and aggregates these scores using a spatio-temporal CUSUM-type statistic over a prescribed class of spatial regions. Operating sequentially, the procedure outputs both a stopping time and an estimated change region, enabling real-time detection with spatial interpretability. We establish theoretical guarantees on false-alarm control, detection delay, and spatial localization accuracy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations and real-world spatio-temporal event data.

*Qianyi Chen,Anpeng Wu,Bo Li,Lu Deng,Yong Wang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in A/B testing with network interference, proposing the mean-in-interior (MII) estimator and its augmented version to reduce variance, adjust for biases, and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve A/B testing accuracy in the presence of network interference, where traditional methods result in either high variance or bias.

Method: The authors introduce the MII estimator to average over interior nodes and reduce variance and augment it with a counterfactual predictor to adjust for covariate biases.

Result: The augmented MII estimator demonstrated excellent performance and adaptability in simulations across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach balances bias and variance in network interference scenarios, offering significant improvements for A/B testing methodologies.

Abstract: A/B testing on platforms often faces challenges from network interference, where a unit's outcome depends not only on its own treatment but also on the treatments of its network neighbors. To address this, cluster-level randomization has become standard, enabling the use of network-aware estimators. These estimators typically trim the data to retain only a subset of informative units, achieving low bias under suitable conditions but often suffering from high variance. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the interior nodes - units whose neighbors all lie within the same cluster - constitute the vast majority of the post-trimming subpopulation. In light of this, we propose directly averaging over the interior nodes to construct the mean-in-interior (MII) estimator, which circumvents the delicate reweighting required by existing network-aware estimators and substantially reduces variance in classical settings. However, we show that interior nodes are often not representative of the full population, particularly in terms of network-dependent covariates, leading to notable bias. We then augment the MII estimator with a counterfactual predictor trained on the entire network, allowing us to adjust for covariate distribution shifts between the interior nodes and full population. By rearranging the expression, we reveal that our augmented MII estimator embodies an analytical form of the point estimator within prediction-powered inference framework. This insight motivates a semi-supervised lens, wherein interior nodes are treated as labeled data subject to selection bias. Extensive and challenging simulation studies demonstrate the outstanding performance of our augmented MII estimator across various settings.

### [423] [Decoding Ambiguous Emotions with Test-Time Scaling in Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03873)
*Hong Jia,Weibin Li,Jingyao Wu,Xiaofeng Yu,Yan Gao,Jintao Cheng,Xiaoyu Tang,Feng Xia,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores ambiguous emotion recognition in speech using audio language models (ALMs) and test-time scaling (TTS) techniques, offering insights into model capacity and affective ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion recognition in speech is vital for conversational AI, but real-world emotions are often ambiguous, overlapping, and context-dependent, posing challenges for annotation and modeling.

Method: Introduced a benchmark for ambiguous emotion recognition using ALMs and TTS strategies, evaluated across three speech emotion datasets, systematically comparing models and analyzing their interaction with affective ambiguity.

Result: The experiments revealed insights into model performance, adaptability, and generalization in handling ambiguous emotions, providing key findings on the interplay between ALMs and TTS techniques.

Conclusion: This benchmark paves the way for developing emotionally intelligent AI systems and identifies directions to better align model assumptions with the complexity of real-world emotions.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from human speech is a critical enabler for socially aware conversational AI. However, while most prior work frames emotion recognition as a categorical classification problem, real-world affective states are often ambiguous, overlapping, and context-dependent, posing significant challenges for both annotation and automatic modeling. Recent large-scale audio language models (ALMs) offer new opportunities for nuanced affective reasoning without explicit emotion supervision, but their capacity to handle ambiguous emotions remains underexplored. At the same time, advances in inference-time techniques such as test-time scaling (TTS) have shown promise for improving generalization and adaptability in hard NLP tasks, but their relevance to affective computing is still largely unknown. In this work, we introduce the first benchmark for ambiguous emotion recognition in speech with ALMs under test-time scaling. Our evaluation systematically compares eight state-of-the-art ALMs and five TTS strategies across three prominent speech emotion datasets. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the interaction between model capacity, TTS, and affective ambiguity, offering new insights into the computational and representational challenges of ambiguous emotion understanding. Our benchmark establishes a foundation for developing more robust, context-aware, and emotionally intelligent speech-based AI systems, and highlights key future directions for bridging the gap between model assumptions and the complexity of real-world human emotion.

*Min Jang,Orevaoghene Ahia,Nazif Tamer,Sachin Kumar,Yulia Tsvetkov,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces BASS, an evaluation framework for assessing music understanding capabilities of audio language models across structural, semantic, and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the ability of language models in comprehending and reasoning with complex music-related tasks like segmentation, transcription, and analysis.

Method: Developed a rigorous benchmark with 2658 questions, analyzing 1993 songs spanning 138 hours of diverse music to test reasoning in structural segmentation, lyric transcription, musicological analysis, and artist collaboration.

Result: Even advanced models perform poorly on reasoning tasks but excel at transcription, showcasing limitations in addressing higher-level music understanding.

Conclusion: BASS sets a foundation for improving audio language models, highlighting challenges and guiding future innovation in understanding and reasoning with musical content.

Abstract: Music understanding is a complex task that often requires reasoning over both structural and semantic elements of audio. We introduce BASS, designed to evaluate music understanding and reasoning in audio language models across four broad categories: structural segmentation, lyric transcription, musicological analysis, and artist collaboration. BASS comprises 2658 questions spanning 12 tasks, 1993 unique songs and covering over 138 hours of music from a wide range of genres and tracks, crafted to assess musicological knowledge and reasoning in real-world scenarios. We evaluate 14 open-source and frontier multimodal LMs, finding that even state-of-the-art models struggle on higher-level reasoning tasks such as structural segmentation and artist collaboration, while performing best on lyric transcription. Our analysis reveals that current models leverage linguistic priors effectively but remain limited in reasoning over musical structure, vocal, and musicological attributes. BASS provides an evaluation framework with widespread applications in music recommendation and search and has the potential to guide the development of audio LMs.

*Takanori Ashihara,Shota Horiguchi,Kohei Matsuura,Tsubasa Ochiai,Marc Delcroix*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods to handle environmental noise in discretized speech signals by enhancing semantic token-based ASR systems, showing wave-to-token enhancement as the best performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the susceptibility of discretized speech signal representations, such as semantic or phonetic tokens, to environmental noise that degrades speech application performance.

Method: Investigated four frontend enhancement models (wave-to-wave, token-to-token, continuous SSL feature-to-token, and wave-to-token) trained independently of ASR backends, using a semantic token-based ASR system.

Result: Wave-to-token enhancement model achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy and robustness on the CHiME-4 dataset, outperforming most ASR systems relying on continuous SSL features.

Conclusion: Wave-to-token enhancement is a viable solution for robust semantic token-based ASR under noisy conditions, showing potential for improving speech applications.

Abstract: Discretized representations of speech signals are efficient alternatives to continuous features for various speech applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech language models. However, these representations, such as semantic or phonetic tokens derived from clustering outputs of self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, are susceptible to environmental noise, which can degrade backend task performance. In this work, we introduce a frontend system that estimates clean speech tokens from noisy speech and evaluate it on an ASR backend using semantic tokens. We consider four types of enhancement models based on their input/output domains: wave-to-wave, token-to-token, continuous SSL features-to-token, and wave-to-token. These models are trained independently of ASR backends. Experiments on the CHiME-4 dataset demonstrate that wave-to-token enhancement achieves the best performance among the frontends. Moreover, it mostly outperforms the ASR system based on continuous SSL features.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper focuses on fine-grained text-to-audio generation by introducing ControlNet and Adapter models for controllable synthesis of attributes like loudness, pitch, and sound events, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is addressing the lack of precise control in text-to-audio generation models for attributes like loudness, pitch, and sound events, aiming to enhance controllable audio synthesis and editing.

Method: The method involves training ControlNet models on pre-trained text-to-audio backbones and introducing two novel designs, T2A-ControlNet and T2A-Adapter. They also propose T2A-Editor for audio event editing.

Result: T2A-Adapter, with only 38M additional parameters, achieves state-of-the-art F1 scores on the AudioSet-Strong benchmark, showing efficient and powerful control capabilities.

Conclusion: This paper concludes by presenting tools and frameworks for precise and efficient controllable audio generation and editing, aiming to promote further research in this domain.

Abstract: We study the fine-grained text-to-audio (T2A) generation task. While recent models can synthesize high-quality audio from text descriptions, they often lack precise control over attributes such as loudness, pitch, and sound events. Unlike prior approaches that retrain models for specific control types, we propose to train ControlNet models on top of pre-trained T2A backbones to achieve controllable generation over loudness, pitch, and event roll. We introduce two designs, T2A-ControlNet and T2A-Adapter, and show that the T2A-Adapter model offers a more efficient structure with strong control ability. With only 38M additional parameters, T2A-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AudioSet-Strong in both event-level and segment-level F1 scores. We further extend this framework to audio editing, proposing T2A-Editor for removing and inserting audio events at time locations specified by instructions. Models, code, dataset pipelines, and benchmarks will be released to support future research on controllable audio generation and editing.

### [427] [Speaker-Aware Simulation Improves Conversational Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04776)
*Máté Gedeon,Péter Mihajlik*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses data augmentation challenges for conversational ASR in Hungarian by adapting a speaker-aware simulated conversations (SASC) method and proposing an enhanced version, C-SASC, with pause modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve conversational ASR performance for Hungarian, a lower-resource language, and explore robust data augmentation methods.

Method: The paper adapts SASC for Hungarian, proposes C-SASC for enhanced pause modeling, and integrates these methods with synthetic and real conversational datasets for ASR training.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improvement in recognition performance with SASC and modest gains with C-SASC, especially for character-level error rates.

Conclusion: Speaker-aware conversational simulations are effective for Hungarian ASR, but more detailed temporal modeling offers limited benefits depending on domain compatibility.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational speech remains challenging due to the limited availability of large-scale, well-annotated multi-speaker dialogue data and the complex temporal dynamics of natural interactions. Speaker-aware simulated conversations (SASC) offer an effective data augmentation strategy by transforming single-speaker recordings into realistic multi-speaker dialogues. However, prior work has primarily focused on English data, leaving questions about the applicability to lower-resource languages. In this paper, we adapt and implement the SASC framework for Hungarian conversational ASR. We further propose C-SASC, an extended variant that incorporates pause modeling conditioned on utterance duration, enabling a more faithful representation of local temporal dependencies observed in human conversation while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original approach. We generate synthetic Hungarian dialogues from the BEA-Large corpus and combine them with real conversational data for ASR training. Both SASC and C-SASC are evaluated extensively under a wide range of simulation configurations, using conversational statistics derived from CallHome, BEA-Dialogue, and GRASS corpora. Experimental results show that speaker-aware conversational simulation consistently improves recognition performance over naive concatenation-based augmentation. While the additional duration conditioning in C-SASC yields modest but systematic gains--most notably in character-level error rates--its effectiveness depends on the match between source conversational statistics and the target domain. Overall, our findings confirm the robustness of speaker-aware conversational simulation for Hungarian ASR and highlight the benefits and limitations of increasingly detailed temporal modeling in synthetic dialogue generation.

### [428] [All-Atom GPCR-Ligand Simulation via Residual Isometric Latent Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03902)
*Jiying Zhang,Shuhao Zhang,Pierre Vandergheynst,Patrick Barth*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPCRLMD, a deep generative framework, to enhance the efficiency of GPCR-ligand all-atom molecular simulations by leveraging a latent space and deep learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPCRs are crucial for therapeutics, but their intricate signalling mechanisms are computationally expensive to study using traditional all-atom MD simulations.

Method: GPCRLMD uses a Harmonic-Prior Variational Autoencoder (HP-VAE) to map GPCR-ligand structures into a latent space, followed by a Residual Latent Flow to simulate evolution trajectories and decode them back to atomic coordinates, preserving dynamics and topology.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulating GPCR-ligand dynamics, accurately representing thermodynamic properties and key interactions.

Conclusion: This approach offers an efficient and accurate alternative for studying GPCR-ligand interactions, making it more feasible to understand their signalling mechanisms for therapeutic purposes.

Abstract: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), primary targets for over one-third of approved therapeutics, rely on intricate conformational transitions to transduce signals. While Molecular Dynamics (MD) is essential for elucidating this transduction process, particularly within ligand-bound complexes, conventional all-atom MD simulation is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce GPCRLMD, a deep generative framework for efficient all-atom GPCR-ligand simulation.GPCRLMD employs a Harmonic-Prior Variational Autoencoder (HP-VAE) to first map the complex into a regularized isometric latent space, preserving geometric topology via physics-informed constraints. Within this latent space, a Residual Latent Flow samples evolution trajectories, which are subsequently decoded back to atomic coordinates. By capturing temporal dynamics via relative displacements anchored to the initial structure, this residual mechanism effectively decouples static topology from dynamic fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that GPCRLMD achieves state-of-the-art performance in GPCR-ligand dynamics simulation, faithfully reproducing thermodynamic observables and critical ligand-receptor interactions.

*Martin G. Frasch,Marlene J. E. Mayer,Clara Becker,Peter Zimmermann,Camilla Zelgert,Marta C. Antonelli,Silvia M. Lobmaier*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This study proposes using deep learning models to detect stress during pregnancy via ECG signals, aiming to improve how prenatal stress is monitored compared to existing subjective questionnaires.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prenatal stress screening relies on subjective methods like questionnaires, which lack continuous and objective monitoring capabilities. There is a need for a reliable, non-invasive, and objective method to assess stress in pregnant women.

Method: The researchers developed a deep learning framework using ResNet-34 with SimCLR contrastive pretraining on ECG data from pregnant women. The model predicts binary stress levels and continuous PSS scores across maternal (mECG), fetal (fECG), and abdominal (aECG) signals. Validation was performed on one dataset (FELICITy 1) and externally tested on another (FELICITy 2). Signal quality-based channel selection was also integrated.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy on the internal FELICITy 1 dataset (mECG: 98.6%, fECG: 99.8%, aECG: 95.5%) but performance dropped during external validation on FELICITy 2 (mECG: 77.3%, aECG: 63.6%). Signal-quality based channel selection improved prediction accuracy (+12% R2). Additionally, mixed-effects models identified significant responses to a yoga intervention.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using self-supervised deep learning and ECG signals for accurate prenatal stress detection. Multi-layer feature extraction is a preferred approach, and this method shows promise for objective, non-invasive stress assessment systems in pregnant women.

Abstract: Prenatal psychological stress affects 15-25% of pregnancies and increases risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Current screening relies on subjective questionnaires (PSS-10), limiting continuous monitoring. We developed deep learning models for stress detection from electrocardiography (ECG) using the FELICITy 1 cohort (151 pregnant women, 32-38 weeks gestation). A ResNet-34 encoder was pretrained via SimCLR contrastive learning on 40,692 ECG segments per subject. Multi-layer feature extraction enabled binary classification and continuous PSS prediction across maternal (mECG), fetal (fECG), and abdominal ECG (aECG). External validation used the FELICITy 2 RCT (28 subjects, different ECG device, yoga intervention vs. control). On FELICITy 1 (5-fold CV): mECG 98.6% accuracy (R2=0.88, MAE=1.90), fECG 99.8% (R2=0.95, MAE=1.19), aECG 95.5% (R2=0.75, MAE=2.80). External validation on FELICITy 2: mECG 77.3% accuracy (R2=0.62, MAE=3.54, AUC=0.826), aECG 63.6% (R2=0.29, AUC=0.705). Signal quality-based channel selection outperformed all-channel averaging (+12% R2 improvement). Mixed-effects models detected a significant intervention response (p=0.041). Self-supervised deep learning on pregnancy ECG enables accurate, objective stress assessment, with multi-layer feature extraction substantially outperforming single embedding approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIANO, a specialized annotation tool for creating information retrieval datasets, which integrates LLM assistance to improve efficiency and accuracy in dataset creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-quality, curated information retrieval datasets has increased due to the rise of LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Current annotation tools complicate the process, prompting the development of a more efficient solution.

Method: The authors developed AIANO, an AI-augmented annotation tool that combines human expertise with LLM assistance, enabling annotators to utilize AI suggestions while maintaining control over decisions. A user study was conducted to compare AIANO with a baseline tool.

Result: AIANO nearly doubled the annotation speed, improved usability, and enhanced retrieval accuracy compared to the baseline tool based on a within-subject study with 15 participants.

Conclusion: AIANO's AI-augmented approach accelerates and improves the quality of dataset creation for information retrieval tasks, setting a standard for annotation efficiency in retrieval-intensive domains.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has rapidly increased the need for high-quality, curated information retrieval datasets. These datasets, however, are currently created with off-the-shelf annotation tools that make the annotation process complex and inefficient. To streamline this process, we developed a specialized annotation tool - AIANO. By adopting an AI-augmented annotation workflow that tightly integrates human expertise with LLM assistance, AIANO enables annotators to leverage AI suggestions while retaining full control over annotation decisions. In a within-subject user study ($n = 15$), participants created question-answering datasets using both a baseline tool and AIANO. AIANO nearly doubled annotation speed compared to the baseline while being easier to use and improving retrieval accuracy. These results demonstrate that AIANO's AI-augmented approach accelerates and enhances dataset creation for information retrieval tasks, advancing annotation capabilities in retrieval-intensive domains.

### [431] [Addressing Corpus Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on RAG Using Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04711)
*Sagie Dekel,Moshe Tennenholtz,Oren Kurland*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes Sparse Document Attention for Retrieval Augmented Generation (SDAG) as a defense against corpus knowledge poisoning by restricting cross-document interactions in neural networks, improving resilience against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG, while effective for updating LLMs and reducing hallucinations, is vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks where malicious documents influence undesired LLM responses. The motivation is to address these vulnerabilities and enhance robustness.

Method: The authors propose Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG), which uses a block-sparse attention mechanism to disallow cross-attention between retrieved documents. This requires minimal inference-time adjustment and no fine-tuning or architectural changes.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrated that SDAG significantly reduces the attack success rate compared to standard causal attention mechanisms. Additionally, combining SDAG with existing state-of-the-art RAG defenses results in statistically significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: SDAG is a straightforward yet effective method to enhance the robustness of RAG systems against corpus knowledge poisoning while significantly advancing defense effectiveness when integrated with existing methods.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a highly effective paradigm for keeping LLM-based responses up-to-date and reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLMs' output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate. We further demonstrate the clear merits of integrating SDAG with state-of-the-art RAG defense methods. Specifically, the integration results in performance that is statistically significantly better than the state-of-the-art.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical anomaly detection without pixel-level annotations is crucial for scalable and effective diagnostics.

Method: The framework employs DINO-V3 representations, embedding similarity, foreground-aware clustering, and cosine similarity to detect anomalies.

Result: The method achieves AUROC scores up to 98.71 on Brain and Liver datasets and produces accurate anomaly localization.

Conclusion: The proposed method is robust, interpretable, and generalizable, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in medical anomaly detection.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in medical images aims to identify abnormal regions without relying on pixel-level annotations, which is crucial for scalable and label-efficient diagnostic systems. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework based on DINO-V3 representations, termed DINO-AD, which leverages self-supervised visual features for precise and interpretable anomaly localization. Specifically, we introduce an embedding similarity matching strategy to select a semantically aligned support image and a foreground-aware K-means clustering module to model the distribution of normal features. Anomaly maps are then computed by comparing the query features with clustered normal embeddings through cosine similarity. Experimental results on both the Brain and Liver datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior quantitative performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches, achieving AUROC scores of up to 98.71. Qualitative results further confirm that our framework produces clearer and more accurate anomaly localization. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: The motivation is to offer a clear, reproducible framework for understanding how PFMs perform for dense prediction tasks like segmentation across diverse datasets and tuning strategies.

Method: The authors created PFM-DenseBench, which assesses PFMs under a unified protocol using multiple adaptation and fine-tuning strategies to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses in dense segmentation tasks.

Result: PFM-DenseBench provides systematic evaluations, offering practice-oriented insights into the performance and stability of PFMs across heterogeneous datasets, highlighting when and why they succeed or fail.

Conclusion: PFM-DenseBench facilitates reproducible evaluation and aids in informed selection of PFMs for real-world dense pathology tasks, contributing to practical advancements in the field.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have rapidly advanced and are becoming a common backbone for downstream clinical tasks, offering strong transferability across tissues and institutions. However, for dense prediction (e.g., segmentation), practical deployment still lacks a clear, reproducible understanding of how different PFMs behave across datasets and how adaptation choices affect performance and stability. We present PFM-DenseBench, a large-scale benchmark for dense pathology prediction, evaluating 17 PFMs across 18 public segmentation datasets. Under a unified protocol, we systematically assess PFMs with multiple adaptation and fine-tuning strategies, and derive insightful, practice-oriented findings on when and why different PFMs and tuning choices succeed or fail across heterogeneous datasets. We release containers, configs, and dataset cards to enable reproducible evaluation and informed PFM selection for real-world dense pathology tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AtlasPatch, an efficient framework for tissue detection and patch extraction in whole-slide image (WSI) preprocessing, achieving high accuracy and low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI preprocessing is critical in AI-driven computational pathology workflows but suffers from inefficiencies due to reliance on inaccurate methods or computationally expensive AI approaches.

Method: AtlasPatch uses the Segment-Anything model fine-tuned on ~30,000 WSI thumbnails and offers computational efficiency by extrapolating tissue masks to full-resolution slides, enabling parallelized patch processing across CPUs and GPUs.

Result: AtlasPatch achieves precision comparable to state-of-the-art methods in tissue segmentation and patch extraction, while significantly reducing computational overhead and supporting downstream workflows.

Conclusion: The proposed AtlasPatch framework provides an open-source, high-performance alternative for WSI preprocessing, optimizing both accuracy and computational efficiency in pathology workflows.

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) preprocessing, typically comprising tissue detection followed by patch extraction, is foundational to AI-driven computational pathology workflows. This remains a major computational bottleneck as existing tools either rely on inaccurate heuristic thresholding for tissue detection, or adopt AI-based approaches trained on limited-diversity data that operate at the patch level, incurring substantial computational complexity. We present AtlasPatch, an efficient and scalable slide preprocessing framework for accurate tissue detection and high-throughput patch extraction with minimal computational overhead. AtlasPatch's tissue detection module is trained on a heterogeneous and semi-manually annotated dataset of ~30,000 WSI thumbnails, using efficient fine-tuning of the Segment-Anything model. The tool extrapolates tissue masks from thumbnails to full-resolution slides to extract patch coordinates at user-specified magnifications, with options to stream patches directly into common image encoders for embedding or store patch images, all efficiently parallelized across CPUs and GPUs. We assess AtlasPatch across segmentation precision, computational complexity, and downstream multiple-instance learning, matching state-of-the-art performance while operating at a fraction of their computational cost.

Method: Utilizes a dual-branch system for multi-scale image processing, combined with spatial and channel attention mechanisms. Introduces cross-branch attention and two new consistency loss functions for better feature integration and spatial integrity.

Result: MS-SCANet outperforms state-of-the-art models in image quality assessment, as demonstrated on datasets such as KonIQ-10k, LIVE, LIVE Challenge, and CSIQ.

Conclusion: The proposed MS-SCANet offers a robust framework that improves efficiency and accuracy in image quality assessment while maintaining high correlation with subjective evaluations.

Abstract: We present the Multi-Scale Spatial Channel Attention Network (MS-SCANet), a transformer-based architecture designed for no-reference image quality assessment (IQA). MS-SCANet features a dual-branch structure that processes images at multiple scales, effectively capturing both fine and coarse details, an improvement over traditional single-scale methods. By integrating tailored spatial and channel attention mechanisms, our model emphasizes essential features while minimizing computational complexity. A key component of MS-SCANet is its cross-branch attention mechanism, which enhances the integration of features across different scales, addressing limitations in previous approaches. We also introduce two new consistency loss functions, Cross-Branch Consistency Loss and Adaptive Pooling Consistency Loss, which maintain spatial integrity during feature scaling, outperforming conventional linear and bilinear techniques. Extensive evaluations on datasets like KonIQ-10k, LIVE, LIVE Challenge, and CSIQ show that MS-SCANet consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust framework with stronger correlations with subjective human scores.

### [436] [Horizon-LM: A RAM-Centric Architecture for LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04816)
*Zhengqing Yuan,Lichao Sun,Yanfang,Ye*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: Horizon-LM introduces a memory-centric system for training large language models by shifting computational roles from GPU memory to CPU memory, improving scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations in scaling large language models, which are increasingly constrained by GPU memory and tied to complex multi-GPU clusters.

Method: Horizon-LM redefines execution by making host memory the parameter store and using GPUs for computation only. It eliminates GPU-resident modules, enables recomputation, and integrates a pipelined execution engine.

Result: Horizon-LM achieves training of models up to 120B parameters on single GPUs with high efficiency, notably outperforming existing methods like DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 in throughput.

Conclusion: Horizon-LM successfully decouples model scaling from GPU dependency, making large-model training feasible with predictable memory use and enabling efficient single-node solutions.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.

### [437] [Theory of Optimal Learning Rate Schedules and Scaling Laws for a Random Feature Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04774)
*Blake Bordelon,Francesco Mori*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of optimal learning rate schedules for training deep learning models with SGD, emphasizing two regimes (easy and hard phases) and exploring optimal control methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and optimize learning rate schedules for deep learning models, which are often chosen empirically, and provide a theoretical framework for efficient training.

Method: The study uses optimal control methods for theoretical analysis and derives optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with SGD. It also explores joint optimization of learning rate and batch size and extends the analysis to momentum optimization.

Result: The research identifies two phases (easy and hard) of optimal learning rate schedules, proposes polynomial decay forms and warmup-stable-decay strategies, and predicts compute-optimal scaling laws. It demonstrates improved rates compared to existing benchmarks and examines experimental setups.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into transferable learning rate schedules, model-specific optimal training strategies, and potential speedups via optimized momentum schedules, contributing to more efficient deep learning training processes.

Abstract: Setting the learning rate for a deep learning model is a critical part of successful training, yet choosing this hyperparameter is often done empirically with trial and error. In this work, we explore a solvable model of optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We consider the optimal schedule $η_T^\star(t)$ where $t$ is the current iterate and $T$ is the total training horizon. This schedule is computed both numerically and analytically (when possible) using optimal control methods. Our analysis reveals two regimes which we term the easy phase and hard phase. In the easy phase the optimal schedule is a polynomial decay $η_T^\star(t) \simeq T^{-ξ} (1-t/T)^δ$ where $ξ$ and $δ$ depend on the properties of the features and task. In the hard phase, the optimal schedule resembles warmup-stable-decay with constant (in $T$) initial learning rate and annealing performed over a vanishing (in $T$) fraction of training steps. We investigate joint optimization of learning rate and batch size, identifying a degenerate optimality condition. Our model also predicts the compute-optimal scaling laws (where model size and training steps are chosen optimally) in both easy and hard regimes. Going beyond SGD, we consider optimal schedules for the momentum $β(t)$, where speedups in the hard phase are possible. We compare our optimal schedule to various benchmarks in our task including (1) optimal constant learning rates $η_T(t) \sim T^{-ξ}$ (2) optimal power laws $η_T(t) \sim T^{-ξ} t^{-χ}$, finding that our schedule achieves better rates than either of these. Our theory suggests that learning rate transfer across training horizon depends on the structure of the model and task. We explore these ideas in simple experimental pretraining setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between fractionalization and crystallization in fractional quantum Hall liquids, especially in strong Landau-level mixing regimes.

Method: Developed MagNet, a self-attention neural-network variational wavefunction, trained via energy minimization of the microscopic Hamiltonian.

Result: MagNet successfully describes both fractional quantum Hall states and electron crystal ground states, discovering competing phases across various regimes.

Conclusion: First-principle AI techniques like MagNet are effective for solving complex quantum many-body problems and uncovering competing phases without external training data or prior physics knowledge.

Abstract: When does a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid crystallize? Addressing this question requires a framework that treats fractionalization and crystallization on equal footing, especially in strong Landau-level mixing regime. Here, we introduce MagNet, a self-attention neural-network variational wavefunction designed for quantum systems in magnetic fields on the torus geometry. We show that MagNet provides a unifying and expressive ansatz capable of describing both FQH states and electron crystals within the same architecture. Trained solely by energy minimization of the microscopic Hamiltonian, MagNet discovers topological liquid and electron crystal ground states across a broad range of Landau-level mixing. Our results highlight the power of first-principles AI for solving strongly interacting many-body problems and finding competing phases without external training data or physics pre-knowledge.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: PluRel synthesizes multi-tabular relational databases to advance Relational Foundation Models (RFMs) using scalable and lightweight methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy restrictions on relational databases required for RFMs training, and overcome challenges in synthesizing multi-table relational data.

Method: PluRel uses step-by-step modeling: directed graphs for schemas, bipartite graphs for inter-table connectivity, and conditional causal mechanisms for feature distributions.

Result: Synthetic database scaling demonstrates power-law loss scaling and improved generalization to real databases during RFM pretraining.

Conclusion: Synthetic data scaling offers a compelling pathway for enhancing RFMs pretraining and generalization performance.

Abstract: Relational Foundation Models (RFMs) facilitate data-driven decision-making by learning from complex multi-table databases. However, the diverse relational databases needed to train such models are rarely public due to privacy constraints. While there are methods to generate synthetic tabular data of arbitrary size, incorporating schema structure and primary--foreign key connectivity for multi-table generation remains challenging. Here we introduce PluRel, a framework to synthesize multi-tabular relational databases from scratch. In a step-by-step fashion, PluRel models (1) schemas with directed graphs, (2) inter-table primary-foreign key connectivity with bipartite graphs, and, (3) feature distributions in tables via conditional causal mechanisms. The design space across these stages supports the synthesis of a wide range of diverse databases, while being computationally lightweight. Using PluRel, we observe for the first time that (1) RFM pretraining loss exhibits power-law scaling with the number of synthetic databases and total pretraining tokens, (2) scaling the number of synthetic databases improves generalization to real databases, and (3) synthetic pretraining yields strong base models for continued pretraining on real databases. Overall, our framework and results position synthetic data scaling as a promising paradigm for RFMs.

### [440] [Piece of CAKE: Adaptive Execution Engines via Microsecond-Scale Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04181)
*Zijie Zhao,Ryan Marcus*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: CAKE is a system that uses microsecond-scale bandit learning to select optimal database kernels for each data morsel, significantly reducing workload latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional database systems depend on static heuristics or defaults for kernel selection, often resulting in suboptimal performance given varied input data distributions.

Method: CAKE employs contextual multi-armed bandit learning, utilizing counterfactual analysis to obtain feedback efficiently and reduce latency by compiling policies into regret trees.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CAKE can improve workload latency by up to 2x when compared to existing static heuristic approaches.

Conclusion: CAKE showcases the potential of adaptive, data-driven kernel selection to enhance database workload efficiency by leveraging modern learning approaches.

Abstract: Low-level database operators often admit multiple physical implementations ("kernels") that are semantically equivalent but have vastly different performance characteristics depending on the input data distribution. Existing database systems typically rely on static heuristics or worst-case optimal defaults to select these kernels, often missing significant performance opportunities. In this work, we propose CAKE (Counterfactual Adaptive Kernel Execution), a system that learns to select the optimal kernel for each data "morsel" using a microsecond-scale contextual multi-armed bandit. CAKE circumvents the high latency of traditional reinforcement learning by exploiting the cheapness of counterfactuals -- selectively running multiple kernels to obtain full feedback -- and compiling policies into low-latency regret trees. Experimentally, we show that CAKE can reduce end-to-end workload latency by up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art static heuristics.

*Annalisa Barbara,Riccardo Poiani,Martino Bernasconi,Andrea Celli*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper studies how a learner can infer payoff functions of players based purely on actions in a Nash equilibrium setting and provides the first minimax-optimal rates for such inference with precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable inference of payoff functions from observed behavior in multi-agent environments, facilitating applications such as counterfactual analysis and mechanism design.

Method: The authors propose estimating the set of payoffs consistent with observed actions using minimax optimal rates, focusing on precision using the Hausdorff metric for exact and approximate equilibrium play.

Result: The study provides learning-theoretic foundations and minimax-optimal rates for set-valued payoff inference in both zero-sum and general-sum games.

Conclusion: This work establishes a theoretical framework for payoff inference in multi-agent settings, advancing the field of inverse game theory for practical applications in economics and security.

Abstract: We study a setting in which two players play a (possibly approximate) Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game, while a learner observes only their actions and has no knowledge of the equilibrium or the underlying game. A natural question is whether the learner can rationalize the observed behavior by inferring the players' payoff functions. Rather than producing a single payoff estimate, inverse game theory aims to identify the entire set of payoffs consistent with observed behavior, enabling downstream use in, e.g., counterfactual analysis and mechanism design across applications like auctions, pricing, and security games. We focus on the problem of estimating the set of feasible payoffs with high probability and up to precision $ε$ on the Hausdorff metric. We provide the first minimax-optimal rates for both exact and approximate equilibrium play, in zero-sum as well as general-sum games. Our results provide learning-theoretic foundations for set-valued payoff inference in multi-agent environments.

*Vasudha Malhotra,Rhea D'silva,Rashina Hoda*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study explores the experiences of 15 women teaching-support staff (TSS) in IT/SE education, shedding light on challenges with authority, gendered dynamics, and inequality in these roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to highlight the often unrecognized and undervalued contributions of women TSS in computing education and address the gendered challenges they face in their roles.

Method: The study synthesizes qualitative data from the lived experiences of 15 women TSS in IT/SE higher education and maps these dynamics onto an intersectional 'wheel of privilege and power.'

Result: The findings reveal that TSS profiles further from the center of privilege (due to factors like ethnicity, language, age, career stage, etc.) face greater relational, emotional, and disciplinary labor to achieve equality.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable recommendations for fostering inclusivity in technology education, aimed at building more equitable and supportive academic environments.

Abstract: Despite their critical role in shaping student learning in computing education, the contributions of women teaching-support staff (TSS) often go unrecognised and undervalued. In this experience report, we synthesise lived experiences of 15 women TSS in IT/SE higher education to illuminate how authority is earned, resisted, and maintained in everyday teaching. Participants shared both their positive and negative lived experiences associated with finding and losing voice with teaching team colleagues on the one hand, and rewarding connections and gendered friction with students on the other. We map these dynamics onto an intersectional "wheel of privilege and power" tailored to TSS roles. The farther a TSS profile sits from the wheel's center (e.g., non-native English, non-white, younger-seeming, non-permanent, early-career), the more relational, emotional, and disciplinary labour is needed to reach parity. We provide actionable insights and recommendations for creating more inclusive education environments in technology dominant fields that are particularly timely as universities worldwide grapple with post-pandemic teaching models and seek to build more inclusive and resilient academic communities.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how large language models (LLMs) navigate value trade-offs in online advice contexts, revealing systematic bias toward certain values and potential risks for homogenized decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With people increasingly relying on LLM-based chatbots for advice, the authors aim to understand how these models approach value trade-offs, which are central to advice-seeking scenarios.

Method: The researchers constructed a hierarchical value framework by studying a curated dataset from four advice-related subreddits. They analyzed value co-occurrence networks to uncover patterns in value conflicts and evaluated LLMs' responses against these frameworks.

Result: Value trade-off structures vary across advice-seeking contexts. LLMs consistently prioritize values related to Exploration & Growth over Benevolence & Connection, indicating systemic biases in AI-mediated advice.

Conclusion: The paper raises concerns about the uniformity of AI-driven advice shaping individual decision-making processes and societal norms, emphasizing the need to address these biases in LLMs.

Abstract: People increasingly seek advice online from both human peers and large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. Such advice rarely involves identifying a single correct answer; instead, it typically requires navigating trade-offs among competing values. We aim to characterize how LLMs navigate value trade-offs across different advice-seeking contexts. First, we examine the value trade-off structure underlying advice seeking using a curated dataset from four advice-oriented subreddits. Using a bottom-up approach, we inductively construct a hierarchical value framework by aggregating fine-grained values extracted from individual advice options into higher-level value categories. We construct value co-occurrence networks to characterize how values co-occur within dilemmas and find substantial heterogeneity in value trade-off structures across advice-seeking contexts: a women-focused subreddit exhibits the highest network density, indicating more complex value conflicts; women's, men's, and friendship-related subreddits exhibit highly correlated value-conflict patterns centered on security-related tensions (security vs. respect/connection/commitment); by contrast, career advice forms a distinct structure where security frequently clashes with self-actualization and growth. We then evaluate LLM value preferences against these dilemmas and find that, across models and contexts, LLMs consistently prioritize values related to Exploration & Growth over Benevolence & Connection. This systemically skewed value orientation highlights a potential risk of value homogenization in AI-mediated advice, raising concerns about how such systems may shape decision-making and normative outcomes at scale.

### [444] [Inference-Time Reasoning Selectively Reduces Implicit Social Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04742)
*Molly Apsel,Michael N. Jones*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper investigates the interaction between reasoning-enabled inference and implicit bias in large language models (LLMs), finding that reasoning reduces implicit social bias in certain models but not in non-social domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit biases in LLMs, drawing from cognitive psychology to explore the theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning.

Method: The authors conducted IAT-style evaluations across 15 stereotype topics to assess the effect of reasoning-enabled inference on implicit bias in LLMs, comparing social and non-social domains.

Result: Reasoning-enabled inference significantly reduced implicit bias in social bias domains of some LLM model classes, but it did not reduce bias in non-social implicit associations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential for reasoning-enabled inference to influence fairness evaluation outcomes in LLMs, while emphasizing the importance of understanding the interaction between alignment procedures and reasoning in shaping bias outcomes.

Abstract: Drawing on constructs from psychology, prior work has identified a distinction between explicit and implicit bias in large language models (LLMs). While many LLMs undergo post-training alignment and safety procedures to avoid expressions of explicit social bias, they still exhibit significant implicit biases on indirect tasks resembling the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning. Motivated by a theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning in human cognition, we examine how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit bias in LLMs. We find that enabling reasoning significantly reduces measured implicit bias on an IAT-style evaluation for some model classes across fifteen stereotype topics. This effect appears specific to social bias domains, as we observe no corresponding reduction for non-social implicit associations. As reasoning is increasingly enabled by default in deployed LLMs, these findings suggest that it can meaningfully alter fairness evaluation outcomes in some systems, while also raising questions about how alignment procedures interact with inference-time reasoning to drive variation in bias reduction across model types. More broadly, this work highlights how theory from cognitive science and psychology can complement AI evaluation research by providing methodological and interpretive frameworks that reveal new insights into model behavior.

*Andrés Holgado-Sánchez,Holger Billhardt,Alberto Fernández,Sascha Ossowski*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel method to learn human value systems automatically, focusing on agreement technologies that align AI systems with ethical principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging task of ensuring AI systems align with various human moral values and systems, especially given the difficulty in computationally defining values and scaling human-engineered specifications.

Method: The authors propose a formal model for value system learning in sequential decision-making using preference-based and inverse reinforcement learning within multi-objective Markov decision processes.

Result: The proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated through simulated use cases, showcasing its potential in learning value grounding functions and value systems.

Conclusion: This work advances AI by providing a scalable, automated way to align agreements in autonomous systems with ethical principles and varying human value systems.

Abstract: Agreement Technologies refer to open computer systems in which autonomous software agents interact with one another, typically on behalf of humans, in order to come to mutually acceptable agreements. With the advance of AI systems in recent years, it has become apparent that such agreements, in order to be acceptable to the involved parties, must remain aligned with ethical principles and moral values. However, this is notoriously difficult to ensure, especially as different human users (and their software agents) may hold different value systems, i.e. they may differently weigh the importance of individual moral values. Furthermore, it is often hard to specify the precise meaning of a value in a particular context in a computational manner. Methods to estimate value systems based on human-engineered specifications, e.g. based on value surveys, are limited in scale due to the need for intense human moderation. In this article, we propose a novel method to automatically \emph{learn} value systems from observations and human demonstrations. In particular, we propose a formal model of the \emph{value system learning} problem, its instantiation to sequential decision-making domains based on multi-objective Markov decision processes, as well as tailored preference-based and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms to infer value grounding functions and value systems. The approach is illustrated and evaluated by two simulated use cases.

*Yanjin Xiang,Zhihua Zhang*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper establishes a universality principle for rank-one spiked tensor models, showing robustness to non-Gaussian noise in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend analysis of spiked tensor models beyond the classical Gaussian noise assumption, making the framework applicable to a broader class of noise distributions.

Method: Utilize resolvent methods, cumulant expansions, and variance bounds to study the spectral distribution and statistical limits of asymmetric tensors under mild assumptions.

Result: The empirical spectral distribution converges to a deterministic limit identical to the Gaussian case, providing explicit characterizations for singular values and spike alignments.

Conclusion: High-dimensional spectral behavior and statistical limits of spiked tensor models are shown to be universally robust across different noise distributions.

Abstract: We study the rank-one spiked tensor model in the high-dimensional regime, where the noise entries are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, unit variance, and finite fourth moment.This setting extends the classical Gaussian framework to a substantially broader class of noise distributions.Focusing on asymmetric tensors of order $d$ ($\ge 3$), we analyze the maximum likelihood estimator of the best rank-one approximation.Under a mild assumption isolating informative critical points of the associated optimization landscape, we show that the empirical spectral distribution of a suitably defined block-wise tensor contraction converges almost surely to a deterministic limit that coincides with the Gaussian case.As a consequence, the asymptotic singular value and the alignments between the estimated and true spike directions admit explicit characterizations identical to those obtained under Gaussian noise. These results establish a universality principle for spiked tensor models, demonstrating that their high-dimensional spectral behavior and statistical limits are robust to non-Gaussian noise.
  Our analysis relies on resolvent methods from random matrix theory, cumulant expansions valid under finite moment assumptions, and variance bounds based on Efron-Stein-type arguments. A key challenge in the proof is how to handle the statistical dependence between the signal term and the noise term.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid approach to address pilot overhead challenges in wideband MIMO systems through tensor completion and neural network integration, achieving notable improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome pilot overhead limitations in high-dimensional channel estimation scenarios for beyond-5G and 6G systems.

Method: A hybrid tensor-based approach using canonical polyadic and Tucker decompositions, combined with a lightweight 3D U-Net, to estimate channels based on sparse observations.

Result: Significant NMSE improvements (10-20 dB over LS and OMP; 24-44% over tensor methods) in both synthetic and ray-tracing channels were achieved.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively recovers sparse signals in high-dimensional scenarios, bridging algebraic and realistic effects with reduced pilot requirements.

Abstract: Channel estimation in wideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems faces fundamental pilot overhead limitations in high-dimensional beyond-5G and sixth-generation (6G) scenarios. This paper presents a hybrid tensor-neural architecture that formulates pilot-limited channel estimation as low-rank tensor completion from sparse observations -- a fundamentally different setting from prior tensor methods that assume fully observed received signal tensors. A canonical polyadic (CP) baseline implemented via a projection-based scheme (Tucker completion under partial observations) and Tucker decompositions are compared under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and scattering conditions: CP performs well for specular channels matching the multipath model, while Tucker provides greater robustness under model mismatch. A lightweight three-dimensional (3D) U-Net learns residual components beyond the low-rank structure, bridging algebraic models and realistic propagation effects. Empirical recovery threshold analysis shows that sample complexity scales approximately with intrinsic model dimensionality $L(N_r + N_t + N_f)$ rather than ambient tensor size $N_r N_t N_f$, where $L$ denotes the number of dominant propagation paths. Experiments on synthetic channels demonstrate 10-20\,dB normalized mean-square error (NMSE) improvement over least-squares (LS) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) baselines at 5-10\% pilot density, while evaluations on DeepMIMO ray-tracing channels show 24-44\% additional NMSE reduction over pure tensor-based methods.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a learned Majorization-Minimization framework for solving inverse problems, aiming to enhance robustness, stability, and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems often require stable and robust optimization schemes due to their ill-posed nature, and current learning-based approaches lack explicit guarantees on descent and curvature.

Method: The authors introduce a bilevel optimization framework using a learned structured curvature majorant governed by a recurrent neural network, constrained by valid MM conditions, to ensure stability and robustness.

Result: Experiments on EEG source imaging show superior performance in accuracy, stability, and generalization compared to deep-unrolled and meta-learning methods.

Conclusion: The learned MM framework successfully combines classical descent guarantees with modern learning techniques, addressing key issues in inverse problem optimization and proving effectiveness across datasets.

Abstract: Inverse problems are often ill-posed and require optimization schemes with strong stability and convergence guarantees. While learning-based approaches such as deep unrolling and meta-learning achieve strong empirical performance, they typically lack explicit control over descent and curvature, limiting robustness. We propose a learned Majorization-Minimization (MM) framework for inverse problems within a bilevel optimization setting. Instead of learning a full optimizer, we learn a structured curvature majorant that governs each MM step while preserving classical MM descent guarantees. The majorant is parameterized by a lightweight recurrent neural network and explicitly constrained to satisfy valid MM conditions. For cosine-similarity losses, we derive explicit curvature bounds yielding diagonal majorants. When analytic bounds are unavailable, we rely on efficient Hessian-vector product-based spectral estimation to automatically upper-bound local curvature without forming the Hessian explicitly. Experiments on EEG source imaging demonstrate improved accuracy, stability, and cross-dataset generalization over deep-unrolled and meta-learning baselines.

*Shuntaro Suzuki,Shuitsu Koyama,Shinnosuke Hirano,Shunya Nagashima*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces PENGUIN, a novel framework for robust vital sign reconstruction from PPG, addressing motion artifacts and noise across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vital sign estimation from PPG are limited by their susceptibility to noise and lack of generalizability. Recent approaches ignore vital sign morphological details, necessitating a robust, fine-grained framework.

Method: The authors propose PENGUIN, a generative flow-matching framework based on deep state space models, designed to condition finely on PPG signals for reconstructing multiple vital signs as continuous waveforms.

Result: PENGUIN was evaluated on six real-world PPG datasets involving three tasks: ECG reconstruction, respiratory monitoring, and ABP monitoring, outperforming both task-specific and general baselines.

Conclusion: PENGUIN is presented as a general, robust framework for decoding PPG signals into various vital signs, achieving superior performance across multiple challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) plays a crucial role in continuous cardiovascular health monitoring as a non-invasive and cost-effective modality. However, PPG signals are susceptible to motion artifacts and noise, making accurate estimation of vital signs such as arterial blood pressure (ABP) challenging. Existing estimation methods are often restricted to a single-task or environment, limiting their generalizability across diverse PPG decoding scenarios. Moreover, recent general-purpose approaches typically rely on predictions over multi-second intervals, discarding the morphological characteristics of vital signs. To address these challenges, we propose PENGUIN, a generative flow-matching framework that extends deep state space models, enabling fine-grained conditioning on PPG for reconstructing multiple vital signs as continuous waveforms. We evaluate PENGUIN using six real-world PPG datasets across three distinct vital sign reconstruction tasks (electrocardiogram reconstruction, respiratory monitoring, and ABP monitoring). Our method consistently outperformed both task-specific and general-purpose baselines, demonstrating PENGUIN as a general framework for robust vital sign reconstruction from PPG.

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-modal foundational model for wireless communication systems that generalizes across tasks and environments using physics-aware self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wireless AI techniques struggle with generalization across tasks and environments, demanding costly retraining for new scenarios.

Method: Develop a task-agnostic model using physics-guided self-supervised pretraining with physical tokens to learn transferable representations across various sensing modalities.

Result: Demonstrated better generalization, robustness to environment shifts, and reduced data needs compared to task-specific approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed model enables transferable, efficient solutions for diverse wireless tasks with minimized dependence on labeled data, marking a significant advancement in wireless AI technology.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is a key enabler for next-generation wireless communication and sensing. Yet, today's learning-based wireless techniques do not generalize well: most models are task-specific, environment-dependent, and limited to narrow sensing modalities, requiring costly retraining when deployed in new scenarios. This work introduces a task-agnostic, multi-modal foundational model for physical-layer wireless systems that learns transferable, physics-aware representations across heterogeneous modalities, enabling robust generalization across tasks and environments. Our framework employs a physics-guided self-supervised pretraining strategy incorporating a dedicated physical token to capture cross-modal physical correspondences governed by electromagnetic propagation. The learned representations enable efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks, including massive multi-antenna optimization, wireless channel estimation, and device localization, using limited labeled data. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate superior generalization, robustness to deployment shifts, and reduced data requirements compared to task-specific baselines.

*Jiaze Wang,Qinghao Zhao,Zizheng Chen,Zhejun Sun,Deyun Zhang,Yuxi Zhou,Shenda Hong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Physiology-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL) method to utilize large-scale unlabeled PPG data for screening aortic valve diseases, achieving superior performance compared to traditional supervised approaches with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional echocardiography-based diagnosis, such as high cost and expertise requirements, and to address the scarcity of labeled Photoplethysmography (PPG) data for effective use in early screening of aortic valve diseases.

Method: The paper introduces PG-SSL, which formulates a set of PPG morphological phenotypes based on clinical knowledge for a proxy task in self-supervised pre-training. This method uses over 170,000 unlabeled PPG samples from the UK Biobank and employs a dual-branch, gated-fusion architecture for fine-tuning with a small labeled dataset.

Result: The PG-SSL framework achieved AUCs of 0.765 for Aortic Stenosis (AS) and 0.776 for Aortic Regurgitation (AR) screenings, outperforming traditional supervised models trained with limited labeled data. It also demonstrated prognostic value as an independent digital biomarker.

Conclusion: PG-SSL effectively addresses the scarcity of labeled data in medical artificial intelligence for early screening of aortic valve disease, showcasing its potential for large-scale, low-cost applications.

Abstract: Traditional diagnosis of aortic valve disease relies on echocardiography, but its cost and required expertise limit its use in large-scale early screening. Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising screening modality due to its widespread availability in wearable devices and its ability to reflect underlying hemodynamic dynamics. However, the extreme scarcity of gold-standard labeled PPG data severely constrains the effectiveness of data-driven approaches. To address this challenge, we propose and validate a new paradigm, Physiology-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), aimed at unlocking the value of large-scale unlabeled PPG data for efficient screening of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Aortic Regurgitation (AR). Using over 170,000 unlabeled PPG samples from the UK Biobank, we formalize clinical knowledge into a set of PPG morphological phenotypes and construct a pulse pattern recognition proxy task for self-supervised pre-training. A dual-branch, gated-fusion architecture is then employed for efficient fine-tuning on a small labeled subset. The proposed PG-SSL framework achieves AUCs of 0.765 and 0.776 for AS and AR screening, respectively, significantly outperforming supervised baselines trained on limited labeled data. Multivariable analysis further validates the model output as an independent digital biomarker with sustained prognostic value after adjustment for standard clinical risk factors. This study demonstrates that PG-SSL provides an effective, domain knowledge-driven solution to label scarcity in medical artificial intelligence and shows strong potential for enabling low-cost, large-scale early screening of aortic valve disease.

### [453] [Learning to Separate RF Signals Under Uncertainty: Detect-Then-Separate vs. Unified Joint Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04650)
*Ariel Rodrigez,Alejandro Lancho,Amir Weiss*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of recovering interference-contaminated signals in single-channel RF processing from diverse interference types by introducing a Unified Joint Model (UJM), which combines detection and separation, and demonstrates its efficiency and scalability compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasingly crowded RF spectrum leads to complicated interference scenarios where signals must coexist despite non-Gaussian interference. Traditional methods relying on known interference types and separate models for each are inefficient, motivating the need for a scalable solution.

Method: The paper develops a Unified Joint Model (UJM) using a single deep neural network architecture and tailored UNet structures to jointly detect and separate interference. It compares this to the traditional detect-then-separate (DTS) method with Gaussian mixture modeling.

Result: UJM achieves performance comparable to oracle-aided DTS, even with diverse signal-to-interference ratios, mismatched training/testing conditions, and interference uncertainty, demonstrating its broad applicability and scalability.

Conclusion: The UJM provides a scalable and practical method for unified signal separation and detection in crowded RF spectrum scenarios, surpassing the limitations of traditional, specialized models and opening avenues for broader applications.

Abstract: The increasingly crowded radio frequency (RF) spectrum forces communication signals to coexist, creating heterogeneous interferers whose structure often departs from Gaussian models. Recovering the interference-contaminated signal of interest in such settings is a central challenge, especially in single-channel RF processing. Existing data-driven methods often assume that the interference type is known, yielding ensembles of specialized models that scale poorly with the number of interferers. We show that detect-then-separate (DTS) strategies admit an analytical justification: within a Gaussian mixture framework, a plug-in maximum a posteriori detector followed by type-conditioned optimal estimation achieves asymptotic minimum mean-square error optimality under a mild temporal-diversity condition. This makes DTS a principled benchmark, but its reliance on multiple type-specific models limits scalability. Motivated by this, we propose a unified joint model (UJM), in which a single deep neural architecture learns to jointly detect and separate when applied directly to the received signal. Using tailored UNet architectures for baseband (complex-valued) RF signals, we compare DTS and UJM on synthetic and recorded interference types, showing that a capacity-matched UJM can match oracle-aided DTS performance across diverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios, interference types, and constellation orders, including mismatched training and testing type-uncertainty proportions. These findings highlight UJM as a scalable and practical alternative to DTS, while opening new directions for unified separation under broader regimes.

*Sina Tavakolian,Nhan Thanh Nguyen,Ahmed Alkhateeb,Markku Juntti*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents a computationally efficient approach for high-mobility mmWave beamforming, drastically reducing computations using compact deep learning architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mmWave beamforming require substantial training overhead and rely on large deep learning models with excessive resource demands. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors propose knowledge distillation (KD)-based compact deep learning architectures that mimic the performance of large models using individual and relational distillation strategies.

Result: The compact models reduce computational complexity and trainable parameters by 99%, matching the beam prediction accuracy and spectral efficiency of large models.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation enables efficient and practical mmWave beamforming while maintaining high performance, suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Beamforming in millimeter-wave (mmWave) high-mobility environments typically incurs substantial training overhead. While prior studies suggest that sub-6 GHz channels can be exploited to predict optimal mmWave beams, existing methods depend on large deep learning (DL) models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient framework for sub-6 GHz channel-mmWave beam mapping based on the knowledge distillation (KD) technique. We develop two compact student DL architectures based on individual and relational distillation strategies, which retain only a few hidden layers yet closely mimic the performance of large teacher DL models. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed student models achieve the teacher's beam prediction accuracy and spectral efficiency while reducing trainable parameters and computational complexity by 99%.

### [455] [Cross-Attention Transformer for Joint Multi-Receiver Uplink Neural Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04728)
*Xavier Tardy,Grégoire Lefebvre,Apostolos Kountouris,Haïfa Fares,Amor Nafkha*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cross-attention Transformer model for jointly decoding uplink OFDM signals received by multiple access points, enhancing performance without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the decoding of uplink OFDM signals in multi-access-point scenarios without relying on explicit channel estimation, ensuring robustness to degraded links or sparse pilots.

Method: The model uses a shared per-receiver encoder for time-frequency structure learning and a cross-attention mechanism to fuse receiver data. It outputs soft log-likelihood ratios for channel decoding and is trained with a bit-metric objective.

Result: The proposed architecture surpasses classical and convolutional baselines across realistic Wi-Fi channels, sometimes matching or surpassing methods with perfect channel knowledge. It remains robust in degraded scenarios with low latency and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: This compact and efficient cross-attention Transformer is a practical and high-performing option for next-generation Wi-Fi receivers, adaptable to various conditions without per-receiver channel estimates.

Abstract: We propose a cross-attention Transformer for joint decoding of uplink OFDM signals received by multiple coordinated access points. A shared per-receiver encoder learns time-frequency structure within each received grid, and a token-wise cross-attention module fuses the receivers to produce soft log-likelihood ratios for a standard channel decoder, without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates. Trained with a bit-metric objective, the model adapts its fusion to per-receiver reliability, tolerates missing or degraded links, and remains robust when pilots are sparse. Across realistic Wi-Fi channels, it consistently outperforms classical pipelines and strong convolutional baselines, frequently matching (and in some cases surpassing) a powerful baseline that assumes perfect channel knowledge per access point. Despite its expressiveness, the architecture is compact, has low computational cost (low GFLOPs), and achieves low latency on GPUs, making it a practical building block for next-generation Wi-Fi receivers.

### [456] [Functional Stochastic Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03999)
*Anming Gu,Bobby Shi,Kevin Tian*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: This paper generalizes Eldan's stochastic localization by replacing Gaussian regularization with log-Laplace transforms for broader applicability in optimization and sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the need to explore stochastic localization under non-Euclidean geometries and improve optimization methods like mirror descent.

Method: The authors introduce a generalized stochastic localization process using log-Laplace regularization and analyze its mixing time under functional Poincaré inequalities.

Result: The framework improves query complexities for differentially private convex optimization in $\ell_p$ norms ($p \in [1, 2)$) in a zeroth-order model.

Conclusion: The generalized localization process extends Eldan's approach to new geometries and offers better optimization performance in certain settings.

Abstract: Eldan's stochastic localization is a probabilistic construction that has proved instrumental to modern breakthroughs in high-dimensional geometry and the design of sampling algorithms. Motivated by sampling under non-Euclidean geometries and the mirror descent algorithm in optimization, we develop a functional generalization of Eldan's process that replaces Gaussian regularization with regularization by any positive integer multiple of a log-Laplace transform. We further give a mixing time bound on the Markov chain induced by our localization process, which holds if our target distribution satisfies a functional Poincaré inequality. Finally, we apply our framework to differentially private convex optimization in $\ell_p$ norms for $p \in [1, 2)$, where we improve state-of-the-art query complexities in a zeroth-order model.

### [457] [Semantic Rate Distortion and Posterior Design: Compute Constraints, Multimodality, and Strategic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03949)
*Emrah Akyol*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper examines strategic Gaussian semantic compression in AI under rate and compute constraints for encoder-decoder optimization, offering foundational insights to improve data and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a theoretical framework for understanding and improving resource efficiency (data, energy, and computation) in AI models and to provide insights into modern multimodal language models.

Method: The authors use information theory and characterize strategic rate distortion functions in different regimes. They derive solutions like semantic waterfilling and Gaussian persuasion while considering compute constraints.

Result: The study reveals exponential gains in semantic accuracy with increasing model depth and compute time. It also explains how multimodal setups remove penalties from remote encoding scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings form a theoretical basis for improving resource efficiency in AI and offer a new perspective on multimodal models as optimized mechanisms under resource constraints.

Abstract: We study strategic Gaussian semantic compression under rate and compute constraints, where an encoder and decoder optimize distinct quadratic objectives. A latent Gaussian state generates a task dependent semantic variable, and the decoder best responds via MMSE estimation, reducing the encoder's problem to posterior covariance design under an information rate constraint. We characterize the strategic rate distortion function in direct, remote, and full information regimes, derive semantic waterfilling and rate constrained Gaussian persuasion solutions, and establish Gaussian optimality under misaligned objectives. We further show that architectural compute limits act as implicit rate constraints, yielding exponential improvements in semantic accuracy with model depth and inference time compute, while multimodal observation eliminates the geometric mean penalty inherent to remote encoding. These results provide information theoretic foundations for data and energy efficient AI and offer a principled interpretation of modern multimodal language models as posterior design mechanisms under resource constraints.

TL;DR: El Agente Estructural is a multimodal agent enhancing autonomous chemistry and molecular modeling by enabling precise 3D molecule manipulation through domain-informed tools and vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of generative models by providing experts with direct, precise control over 3D molecular manipulations while maintaining complex frameworks.

Method: The method involves integrating domain-informed tools and vision-language models to allow context-aware manipulation of molecular geometries.

Result: Estructural enables various real-world molecular modeling tasks such as functionalization, ligand binding, stereochemical construction, and image-guided generation.

Conclusion: The system introduces a significant tool for chemically meaningful, interactive molecular modeling and is planned to integrate with El Agente Quntur for enhanced autonomous chemistry applications.

Abstract: We present El Agente Estructural, a multimodal, natural-language-driven geometry-generation and manipulation agent for autonomous chemistry and molecular modelling. Unlike molecular generation or editing via generative models, Estructural mimics how human experts directly manipulate molecular systems in three dimensions by integrating a comprehensive set of domain-informed tools and vision-language models. This design enables precise control over atomic or functional group replacements, atomic connectivity, and stereochemistry without the need to rebuild extensive core molecular frameworks. Through a series of representative case studies, we demonstrate that Estructural enables chemically meaningful geometry manipulation across a wide range of real-world scenarios. These include site-selective functionalization, ligand binding, ligand exchange, stereochemically controlled structure construction, isomer interconversion, fragment-level structural analysis, image-guided generation of structures from schematic reaction mechanisms, and mechanism-driven geometry generation and modification. These examples illustrate how multimodal reasoning, when combined with specialized geometry-aware tools, supports interactive and context-aware molecular modelling beyond structure generation. Looking forward, the integration of Estructural into El Agente Quntur, an autonomous multi-agent quantum chemistry platform, enhances its capabilities by adding sophisticated tools for the generation and editing of three-dimensional structures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quntur, an AI system designed as a research collaborator for computational quantum chemistry, aiming to make quantum chemistry more accessible to scientists by overcoming existing barriers such as complexity and software heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum chemistry is powerful but inaccessible to non-experts due to its complex methodologies, software issues, and interpretation barriers. The paper aims to democratize the field through Quntur, an AI system.

Method: Quntur leverages reasoning-driven decisions instead of hard-coded rules, builds generalizable actions for efficiency, and guides deep research by integrating abstract reasoning and understanding software syntax.

Result: Quntur enables comprehensive quantum chemical experiments using ORCA 6.0, reasoning over documentation and literature to autonomously plan, execute, and analyze experiments.

Conclusion: Quntur demonstrates the feasibility of AI systems as collaborators in computational quantum chemistry and provides insights into advancing such systems towards full autonomy in research.

Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a foundational enabling tool for the fields of chemistry, materials science, computational biology and others. Despite of its power, the practical application of quantum chemistry simulations remains in the hands of qualified experts due to methodological complexity, software heterogeneity, and the need for informed interpretation of results. To bridge the accessibility gap for these tools and expand their reach to chemists with broader backgrounds, we introduce El Agente Quntur, a hierarchical, multi-agent AI system designed to operate not merely as an automation tool but as a research collaborator for computational quantum chemistry. Quntur was designed following three main strategies: i) elimination of hard-coded procedural policies in favour of reasoning-driven decisions, ii) construction of general and composable actions that facilitate generalization and efficiency, and iii) implementation of guided deep research to integrate abstract quantum-chemical reasoning across subdisciplines and a detailed understanding of the software's internal logic and syntax. Although instantiated in ORCA, these design principles are applicable to research agents more generally and easily expandable to additional quantum chemistry packages and beyond. Quntur supports the full range of calculations available in ORCA 6.0 and reasons over software documentation and scientific literature to plan, execute, adapt, and analyze in silico chemistry experiments following best practices. We discuss the advances and current bottlenecks in agentic systems operating at the research level in computational chemistry, and outline a roadmap toward a fully autonomous end-to-end computational chemistry research agent.

TL;DR: Pre-trained molecular encoders lack task specificity. ACE-Mol, using weak supervision with molecular motifs and language descriptors, rapidly aligns representations to tasks, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most pre-trained molecular encoders fail to provide task-sensitive representations, limiting their flexibility and accuracy.

Method: ACE-Mol leverages weak supervision using computationally inexpensive, programmatically derived molecular motifs paired with natural language descriptors to enable task-aligned embeddings.

Result: ACE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance across molecular property prediction benchmarks and provides interpretable, chemically meaningful representations.

Conclusion: Weak supervision via motifs and descriptor pairing in ACE-Mol enables efficient, scalable, and task-adaptive molecular representation learning.

Abstract: Molecular representations are inherently task-dependent, yet most pre-trained molecular encoders are not. Task conditioning promises representations that reorganize based on task descriptions, but existing approaches rely on expensive labeled data. We show that weak supervision on programmatically derived molecular motifs is sufficient. Our Adaptive Chemical Embedding Model (ACE-Mol) learns from hundreds of motifs paired with natural language descriptors that are cheap to compute, trivial to scale. Conventional encoders slowly search the embedding space for task-relevant structure, whereas ACE-Mol immediately aligns its representations with the task. ACE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance across molecular property prediction benchmarks with interpretable, chemically meaningful representations.

*Jane Schlesinger,Simon Hjaltason,Nathan J. Szymanski,Christopher J. Bartel*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Machine learning models predict synthesizability of solid-state materials, but their alignment with material thermodynamics shows inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate machine learning models for synthesizing materials and their alignment with thermodynamic principles.

Method: Analyzing synthesis prediction models in comparison to thermodynamic metrics from a dataset of synthesis recipes and computed values using CHGNet and Chemeleon generative model.

Result: Models tend to overpredict synthesizability but some scores correlate with thermodynamic stability and selectivity.

Conclusion: There are gaps in machine learning models for material synthesis prediction, prompting a new methodology for assessment without relying on failed synthesis examples.

Abstract: Machine learning models have recently emerged to predict whether hypothetical solid-state materials can be synthesized. These models aim to circumvent direct first-principles modeling of solid-state phase transformations, instead learning from large databases of successfully synthesized materials. Here, we assess the alignment of several recently introduced synthesis prediction models with material and reaction thermodynamics, quantified by the energy with respect to the convex hull and a metric accounting for thermodynamic selectivity of enumerated synthesis reactions. A dataset of successful synthesis recipes was used to determine the likely bounds on both quantities beyond which materials can be deemed unlikely to be synthesized. With these bounds as context, thermodynamic quantities were computed using the CHGNet foundation potential for thousands of new hypothetical materials generated using the Chemeleon generative model. Four recently published machine learning models for synthesizability prediction were applied to this same dataset, and the resultant predictions were considered against computed thermodynamics. We find these models generally overpredict the likelihood of synthesis, but some model scores do trend with thermodynamic heuristics, assigning lower scores to materials that are less stable or do not have an available synthesis recipe that is calculated to be thermodynamically selective. In total, this work identifies existing gaps in machine learning models for materials synthesis and introduces a new approach to assess their quality in the absence of extensive negative examples (failed syntheses).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of generative 3D models has emphasized the bottleneck in animation pipelines caused by inefficient and decoupled rigging and skinning processes.

Method: The paper introduces SkinTokens, a discrete representation for skinning weights using an FSQ-CVAE model, and combines it with TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework. Reinforcement learning is applied to improve generalization.

Result: The SkinTokens representation improves skinning accuracy by 98%-133%, while TokenRig enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable, unified approach to 3D rigging, offering improved fidelity and robustness, addressing challenges in animation pipelines.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.

Result: Professionals connected cybersecurity education to concern about AML threats. CTF challenges effectively increased students' interest in AML vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of incorporating security education into the ML curriculum to address AML challenges effectively.

Abstract: An exponential growth of Machine Learning and its Generative AI applications brings with it significant security challenges, often referred to as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). In this paper, we conducted two comprehensive studies to explore the perspectives of industry professionals and students on different AML vulnerabilities and their educational strategies. In our first study, we conducted an online survey with professionals revealing a notable correlation between cybersecurity education and concern for AML threats. For our second study, we developed two CTF challenges that implement Natural Language Processing and Generative AI concepts and demonstrate a poisoning attack on the training data set. The effectiveness of these challenges was evaluated by surveying undergraduate and graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University, finding that a CTF-based approach effectively engages interest in AML threats. Based on the responses of the participants in our research, we provide detailed recommendations emphasizing the critical need for integrated security education within the ML curriculum.

*Nikolas Melissaris,Jiayi Xu,Antigoni Polychroniadou,Akira Takahashi,Chenkai Weng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ZKBoost, a protocol to provide zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT) for XGBoost models, ensuring integrity without revealing sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of gradient-boosted decision trees like XGBoost in sensitive environments necessitates cryptographically verifiable training integrity to build trust.

Method: The authors propose a fixed-point XGBoost implementation, a template for zkPoT that integrates with zero-knowledge proof systems, and a VOLE-based technique for efficiently verifying nonlinear operations.

Result: Their implementation achieves similar accuracy to standard XGBoost (within 1%) and enables feasible zkPoT execution on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ZKBoost successfully demonstrates the practicality of zero-knowledge validation for XGBoost model training, ensuring data privacy without compromising performance.

Abstract: Gradient boosted decision trees, particularly XGBoost, are among the most effective methods for tabular data. As deployment in sensitive settings increases, cryptographic guarantees of model integrity become essential. We present ZKBoost, the first zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT) protocol for XGBoost, enabling model owners to prove correct training on a committed dataset without revealing data or parameters. We make three key contributions: (1) a fixed-point XGBoost implementation compatible with arithmetic circuits, enabling instantiation of efficient zkPoT, (2) a generic template of zkPoT for XGBoost, which can be instantiated with any general-purpose ZKP backend, and (3) vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE)-based instantiation resolving challenges in proving nonlinear fixed-point operations. Our fixed-point implementation matches standard XGBoost accuracy within 1\% while enabling practical zkPoT on real-world datasets.

### [468] [Inference-Time Backdoors via Hidden Instructions in LLM Chat Templates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04653)
*Ariel Fogel,Omer Hofman,Eilon Cohen,Roman Vainshtein*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new, overlooked attack surface in language model deployments through maliciously modified chat templates, enabling inference-time backdoors without altering model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security concerns in language models used in production, focusing on potential backdoor attacks and exploring less-investigated vulnerabilities such as chat templates.

Method: Developed and evaluated template-based backdoors across various language models, targeting objectives such as factual accuracy degradation and attacker-controlled URL emission without modifying training data or model weights.

Result: Factual accuracy dropped significantly from 90% to 15% under triggered conditions, and targeted URLs achieved an over 80% success rate, demonstrating the reliability of the attack and evasion of security measures.

Conclusion: Chat templates represent a dangerous, overlooked attack vector in the language model supply chain, necessitating attention to defend this vulnerability in open-weight model deployments.

Abstract: Open-weight language models are increasingly used in production settings, raising new security challenges. One prominent threat in this context is backdoor attacks, in which adversaries embed hidden behaviors in language models that activate under specific conditions. Previous work has assumed that adversaries have access to training pipelines or deployment infrastructure. We propose a novel attack surface requiring neither, which utilizes the chat template. Chat templates are executable Jinja2 programs invoked at every inference call, occupying a privileged position between user input and model processing. We show that an adversary who distributes a model with a maliciously modified template can implant an inference-time backdoor without modifying model weights, poisoning training data, or controlling runtime infrastructure. We evaluated this attack vector by constructing template backdoors targeting two objectives: degrading factual accuracy and inducing emission of attacker-controlled URLs, and applied them across eighteen models spanning seven families and four inference engines. Under triggered conditions, factual accuracy drops from 90% to 15% on average while attacker-controlled URLs are emitted with success rates exceeding 80%; benign inputs show no measurable degradation. Backdoors generalize across inference runtimes and evade all automated security scans applied by the largest open-weight distribution platform. These results establish chat templates as a reliable and currently undefended attack surface in the LLM supply chain.

### [469] [Benchmarking Automatic Speech Recognition for Indian Languages in Agricultural Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03868)
*Chandrashekar M S,Vineet Singh,Lakshmi Pedapudi*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper discusses the evaluation of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in agriculture across three Indian languages with new benchmarks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate digitization of agricultural advisory services in India through robust ASR systems capable of handling domain-specific and multi-language contexts.

Method: The authors propose a benchmarking framework using 10,934 audio recordings, introducing metrics like Agriculture Weighted Word Error Rate (AWWER) and domain-specific utility scoring alongside traditional methods.

Result: Hindi ASR systems performed the best with a WER of 16.2%, while Odia faced significant challenges with a best WER of 35.1%. Speaker diarization showed effectiveness in reducing WER for multi-speaker recordings.

Conclusion: It establishes baseline benchmarks, identifies recurring error patterns, and provides recommendations to enhance ASR systems for low-resource agricultural domains.

Abstract: The digitization of agricultural advisory services in India requires robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems capable of accurately transcribing domain-specific terminology in multiple Indian languages. This paper presents a benchmarking framework for evaluating ASR performance in agricultural contexts across Hindi, Telugu, and Odia languages. We introduce evaluation metrics including Agriculture Weighted Word Error Rate (AWWER) and domain-specific utility scoring to complement traditional metrics. Our evaluation of 10,934 audio recordings, each transcribed by up to 10 ASR models, reveals performance variations across languages and models, with Hindi achieving the best overall performance (WER: 16.2%) while Odia presents the greatest challenges (best WER: 35.1%, achieved only with speaker diarization). We characterize audio quality challenges inherent to real-world agricultural field recordings and demonstrate that speaker diarization with best-speaker selection can substantially reduce WER for multi-speaker recordings (upto 66% depending on the proportion of multi-speaker audio). We identify recurring error patterns in agricultural terminology and provide practical recommendations for improving ASR systems in low-resource agricultural domains. The study establishes baseline benchmarks for future agricultural ASR development.

### [470] [Sounding Highlights: Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Audio-Visual Video Highlight Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03891)
*Seohyun Joo,Yoori Oh*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework (DAViHD) for video highlight detection, improving performance by incorporating a dual-pathway audio encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video highlight detection models underutilize the audio modality and fail to leverage rich, dynamic sound qualities.

Method: DAViHD employs a dual-pathway audio encoder—one pathway for capturing semantic audio content and another for dynamic spectro-temporal acoustic changes, integrated into an audio-visual framework.

Result: DAViHD achieves state-of-the-art results on the Mr.HiSum benchmark for video highlight detection.

Conclusion: Effective integration of a dual-pathway audio representation significantly enhances video highlight detection capabilities.

Abstract: Audio-visual video highlight detection aims to automatically identify the most salient moments in videos by leveraging both visual and auditory cues. However, existing models often underutilize the audio modality, focusing on high-level semantic features while failing to fully leverage the rich, dynamic characteristics of sound. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Video Highlight Detection (DAViHD). The dual-pathway audio encoder is composed of a semantic pathway for content understanding and a dynamic pathway that captures spectro-temporal dynamics. The semantic pathway extracts high-level information by identifying the content within the audio, such as speech, music, or specific sound events. The dynamic pathway employs a frequency-adaptive mechanism as time evolves to jointly model these dynamics, enabling it to identify transient acoustic events via salient spectral bands and rapid energy changes. We integrate the novel audio encoder into a full audio-visual framework and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Mr.HiSum benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a sophisticated, dual-faceted audio representation is key to advancing the field of highlight detection.

*Chien-Chun Wang,Hung-Shin Lee,Hsin-Min Wang,Berlin Chen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Introduces URSA-GAN, a generative framework addressing mismatches in noise and channel conditions to enhance ASR and SE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for ASR and SE struggle with domain shifts, particularly under unseen noise and channel distortions.

Method: Proposes URSA-GAN, using a dual-embedding architecture with noise/channel encoders and a GAN-based speech generator to ensure domain alignment and phonetic integrity.

Result: URSA-GAN yields relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: URSA-GAN effectively addresses domain mismatches, enhancing robustness and generalization for ASR and SE models in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Pre-trained models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech enhancement (SE) have exhibited remarkable capabilities under matched noise and channel conditions. However, these models often suffer from severe performance degradation when confronted with domain shifts, particularly in the presence of unseen noise and channel distortions. In view of this, we in this paper present URSA-GAN, a unified and domain-aware generative framework specifically designed to mitigate mismatches in both noise and channel conditions. URSA-GAN leverages a dual-embedding architecture that consists of a noise encoder and a channel encoder, each pre-trained with limited in-domain data to capture domain-relevant representations. These embeddings condition a GAN-based speech generator, facilitating the synthesis of speech that is acoustically aligned with the target domain while preserving phonetic content. To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios. Notably, evaluations on compound test conditions with both channel and noise degradations confirm the generalization ability of URSA-GAN, yielding relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics.

### [472] [Towards X-embodiment safety: A control theory perspective on transferring safety certificates across dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03987)
*Nikolaos Bousias,George Pappas*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces the transferred control barrier function (tCBF) framework to enforce safety constraints between mismatched dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety certificates for control systems are challenging to design for complex, high-dimensional dynamics. Simplified models often provide a basis for easier design.

Method: The framework transfers safety guarantees using simulation functions and margin terms. It uses quadratic-program-based safety filters to account for model mismatch.

Result: Effectiveness is demonstrated in a quadrotor navigation task ensuring collision avoidance with minimal intervention to the nominal controller.

Conclusion: The tCBF framework offers a flexible approach for enforcing safety across systems with different state dimensions or dynamics, broadening applications in heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a powerful tool for enforcing safety constraints in control systems, but their direct application to complex, high-dimensional dynamics is often challenging. In many settings, safety certificates are more naturally designed for simplified or alternative system models that do not exactly match the dynamics of interest. This paper addresses the problem of transferring safety guarantees between dynamical systems with mismatched dynamics. We propose a transferred control barrier function (tCBF) framework that enables safety constraints defined on one system to be systematically enforced on another system using a simulation function and an explicit margin term. The resulting transferred barrier accounts for model mismatch and induces a safety condition that can be enforced on the target system via a quadratic-program-based safety filter. The proposed approach is general and does not require the two systems to share the same state dimension or dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on a quadrotor navigation task with the transferred barrier ensuring collision avoidance for the target system, while remaining minimally invasive to a nominal controller. These results highlight the potential of transferred control barrier functions as a general mechanism for enforcing safety across heterogeneous dynamical systems.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper focuses on safety challenges in applying foundation models to robotics, proposing modular safety guardrails for improved safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the new safety challenges posed by the integration of foundation models in robotics, particularly in handling open-ended semantic reasoning and embodied physical actions.

Method: The paper proposes modular safety guardrails, with monitoring and intervention layers, to enhance safety. It also emphasizes cross-layer co-design opportunities for faster and effective safety deployment.

Result: This approach is suggested to provide comprehensive safety across various dimensions, allowing better handling of tasks, environments, and human expectations in robotics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by encouraging exploration of better guardrail modules and co-design strategies to ensure safer deployment of physical AI in the real world.

Abstract: The integration of foundation models (FMs) into robotics has accelerated real-world deployment, while introducing new safety challenges arising from open-ended semantic reasoning and embodied physical action. These challenges require safety notions beyond physical constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we characterize FM-enabled robot safety along three dimensions: action safety (physical feasibility and constraint compliance), decision safety (semantic and contextual appropriateness), and human-centered safety (conformance to human intent, norms, and expectations). We argue that existing approaches, including static verification, monolithic controllers, and end-to-end learned policies, are insufficient in settings where tasks, environments, and human expectations are open-ended, long-tailed, and subject to adaptation over time. To address this gap, we propose modular safety guardrails, consisting of monitoring (evaluation) and intervention layers, as an architectural foundation for comprehensive safety across the autonomy stack. Beyond modularity, we highlight possible cross-layer co-design opportunities through representation alignment and conservatism allocation to enable faster, less conservative, and more effective safety enforcement. We call on the community to explore richer guardrail modules and principled co-design strategies to advance safe real-world physical AI deployment.

*Dhruv S. Kushwaha,Zoleikha A. Biron*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces LC-SAC, an RL algorithm integrating Lyapunov stability guarantees using Koopman operator theory for better performance in safety-critical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has succeeded in decision-making tasks, but its lack of stability guarantees limits application in safety-critical systems. Addressing this, the paper aims to enhance RL algorithms with stability assurances.

Method: The authors employ Koopman operator theory using extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to derive a candidate Lyapunov function and incorporate it into a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework.

Result: The LC-SAC algorithm demonstrated better stability guarantees and reduced Lyapunov stability violations in a 2D Quadrotor trajectory tracking task using a safe-control-gym environment.

Conclusion: LC-SAC provides a novel stability-informed RL method, improving upon standard RL approaches by constraining policies to ensure stability while maintaining effective training convergence.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems. However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

*Chongyang Shi,Michael Dorothy,Jie Fu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper addresses policy synthesis for contextual partially observable Markov decision processes (CPOMDPs) by proposing an information-driven objective and a novel algorithm (C-IDS) to optimize context identification and cumulative returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of controlling systems governed by unknown latent contexts in CPOMDPs, which traditional POMDP solutions fail to address adequately.

Method: The paper introduces an information-directed objective combining cumulative return maximization with mutual information regarding latent context, formulates C-IDS algorithm using this objective, and uses Lagrangian relaxation to analyze the information structure.

Result: The proposed approach achieves faster context identification and higher returns in a continuous Light-Dark environment compared to traditional POMDP methods.

Conclusion: The integration of information-theoretic objectives and C-IDS algorithm proves effective in synthesizing policies for CPOMDPs, improving both reward and latent context understanding simultaneously.

Abstract: We study the policy synthesis problem in contextual partially observable Markov decision processes (CPOMDPs), where the environment is governed by an unknown latent context that induces distinct POMDP dynamics. Our goal is to design a policy that simultaneously maximizes cumulative return and actively reduces uncertainty about the underlying context. We introduce an information-directed objective that augments reward maximization with mutual information between the latent context and the agent's observations. We develop the C-IDS algorithm to synthesize policies that maximize the information-directed objective. We show that the objective can be interpreted as a Lagrangian relaxation of the linear information ratio and prove that the temperature parameter is an upper bound on the information ratio. Based on this characterization, we establish a sublinear Bayesian regret bound over K episodes. We evaluate our approach on a continuous Light-Dark environment and show that it consistently outperforms standard POMDP solvers that treat the unknown context as a latent state variable, achieving faster context identification and higher returns.

TL;DR: The paper presents SPEAR, a multi-agent coordination framework designed for smart contract auditing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance smart contract auditing by leveraging multi-agent systems (MAS) for improved coordination, recovery, and efficient security analysis mechanisms.

Method: SPEAR utilizes specialized agents such as a Planning Agent, Execution Agent, and Repair Agent, incorporating protocols for task allocation, recovery, and belief updates for comprehensive auditing.

Result: An empirical study demonstrates that SPEAR outperforms centralized and pipeline-based approaches in coordination, resource utilization, and recovery behavior under controlled failure scenarios.

Conclusion: SPEAR proves effective in enhancing security workflows for smart contract auditing, offering robust coordination and autonomous recovery mechanisms.

Abstract: We present SPEAR, a multi-agent coordination framework for smart contract auditing that applies established MAS patterns in a realistic security analysis workflow. SPEAR models auditing as a coordinated mission carried out by specialized agents: a Planning Agent prioritizes contracts using risk-aware heuristics, an Execution Agent allocates tasks via the Contract Net protocol, and a Repair Agent autonomously recovers from brittle generated artifacts using a programmatic-first repair policy. Agents maintain local beliefs updated through AGM-compliant revision, coordinate via negotiation and auction protocols, and revise plans as new information becomes available. An empirical study compares the multi-agent design with centralized and pipeline-based alternatives under controlled failure scenarios, focusing on coordination, recovery behavior, and resource use.

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for cellular automata using category theory, extending classical definitions to arbitrary categories. It introduces new properties for morphisms and discusses their algebraic structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the definition of cellular automata beyond set-theoretic constraints using category theory, thus unifying existing concepts.

Method: The paper defines cellular automata in a categorical setting using morphisms in a category with products. It extends classical theorems and incorporates group homomorphisms for generalized cellular automata.

Result: Generalized cellular automata form subcategories in $c$ and satisfy a categorical Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem. Their structure includes finite weak products involving free group products.

Conclusion: This categorical framework unifies cellular automata definitions, providing new proofs of foundational results and extending the classical theory into a broader mathematical perspective.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generalized framework for cellular automata using the language of category theory, extending the classical definition beyond set-theoretic constraints. For an arbitrary category $\mathscr{C}$ with products, we define $\mathscr{C}$-cellular automata as morphisms $τ: A^G \to B^G$ in $\mathscr{C}$, where the alphabets $A$ and $B$ are objects in $\mathscr{C}$ and the universe is a group $G$. We show that $\mathscr{C}$-cellular automata form a subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$ closed under finite products, and that they satisfy a categorical version of the Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem. For two arbitrary group universes $G$ and $H$, we extend our theory to define generalized $\mathscr{C}$-cellular automata as morphisms $τ: A^G \to B^H$ constructed via a group homomorphism $φ: H \to G$. Finally, we prove that generalized $\mathscr{C}$-cellular automata form a subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$ with a finite weak product involving the free product of the underlying group universes. This framework unifies existing concepts and provides purely categorical proofs of foundational results in the theory of cellular automata.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new paradigm called self-evolving embodied AI, which focuses on creating adaptive and continuously evolving intelligent systems in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional embodied AI, which relies on fixed settings and static environments, and to enable AI to adapt in dynamic, real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper defines the concept of self-evolving embodied AI and outlines its framework, components, and mechanisms. It also reviews current advancements, discusses applications, and highlights research directions.

Result: The research outlines how self-evolving embodied AI can operate autonomously with features like memory self-updating, task switching, environment prediction, and model evolution.

Conclusion: Self-evolving embodied AI provides a path for agents to learn and engage with environments in a human-like manner, advancing the pursuit of general artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system formed by agents and their environment through active perception, embodied cognition, and action interaction. Existing embodied AI remains confined to human-crafted setting, in which agents are trained on given memory and construct models for given tasks, enabling fixed embodiments to interact with relatively static environments. Such methods fail in in-the-wild setting characterized by variable embodiments and dynamic open environments. This paper introduces self-evolving embodied AI, a new paradigm in which agents operate based on their changing state and environment with memory self-updating, task self-switching, environment self-prediction, embodiment self-adaptation, and model self-evolution, aiming to achieve continually adaptive intelligence with autonomous evolution. Specifically, we present the definition, framework, components, and mechanisms of self-evolving embodied AI, systematically review state-of-the-art works for realized components, discuss practical applications, and point out future research directions. We believe that self-evolving embodied AI enables agents to autonomously learn and interact with environments in a human-like manner and provide a new perspective toward general artificial intelligence.

*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li,Tie-Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores a human-AI hybrid method to advance scientific research by combining AI data processing with human judgment to generate meaningful research questions and forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess whether AI scientists, particularly large language models, can identify meaningful research questions and make long-term predictions on scientific breakthroughs, a largely unexplored avenue.

Method: The methodology is divided into three phases: AI-Accelerated Information Gathering, Candidate Question Proposing using an ensemble of LLMs, and Hybrid Question Selection through multi-stage human oversight.

Result: The hybrid system was tested to predict the Top 10 Scientific Breakthroughs of 2025 and the Top 10 Scientific Questions for 2026. Results showed AI aligns well with humans on recognized breakthroughs but diverges significantly on subjective, future-oriented questions.

Conclusion: While AI proves capable in structured data processing and analysis, human judgment remains essential for evaluating forward-looking scientific challenges, supporting the need for a human-AI collaborative approach.

Abstract: The "AI Scientist" paradigm is transforming scientific research by automating key stages of the research process, from idea generation to scholarly writing. This shift is expected to accelerate discovery and expand the scope of scientific inquiry. However, a key question remains unclear: can AI scientists identify meaningful research questions? While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied successfully to task-specific ideation, their potential to conduct strategic, long-term assessments of past breakthroughs and future questions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore a human-AI hybrid solution that integrates the scalable data processing capabilities of AI with the value judgment of human experts. Our methodology is structured in three phases. The first phase, AI-Accelerated Information Gathering, leverages AI's advantage in processing vast amounts of literature to generate a hybrid information base. The second phase, Candidate Question Proposing, utilizes this synthesized data to prompt an ensemble of six diverse LLMs to propose an initial candidate pool, filtered via a cross-model voting mechanism. The third phase, Hybrid Question Selection, refines this pool through a multi-stage filtering process that progressively increases human oversight. To validate this system, we conducted an experiment aiming to identify the Top 10 Scientific Breakthroughs of 2025 and the Top 10 Scientific Questions for 2026 across five major disciplines. Our analysis reveals that while AI agents demonstrate high alignment with human experts in recognizing established breakthroughs, they exhibit greater divergence in forecasting prospective questions, suggesting that human judgment remains crucial for evaluating subjective, forward-looking challenges.

TL;DR: The study introduces a vision-language model (VLM) to edit HTML and reduce web accessibility violations using supervised learning and a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address web accessibility issues by reducing WCAG2 violations through automated HTML corrections while preserving appearance and content.

Method: A violation-conditioned VLM is developed, guided by a custom dataset (WebAccessVL) to learn accessibility corrections based on HTML and its rendering.

Result: The model reduces WCAG2 violations from 5.34 to 0.44 per website, surpassing major LLM APIs like Gemini and GPT-5, while retaining visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed VLM proves effective in reducing accessibility violations while preserving the original aesthetics and content of websites.

Abstract: We present a vision-language model (VLM) that automatically edits website HTML to address Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 (WCAG2) violations. We formulate this as a supervised image-conditioned program synthesis task, where the model learns to correct HTML given the HTML and its rendering. We collected WebAccessVL, a new dataset with manually corrected accessibility violations, establishing paired training data. We then propose a violation-conditioned VLM that additionally conditions on the WCAG2 violation count to guide the correction process. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively reduces the average number of violations from 5.34 to 0.44 per website, outperforming commercial LLM APIs (Gemini, GPT-5). A perceptual study confirms that our edited websites maintain the original visual appearance and content.

*Chan-in Sio,Alex Mann,Lingxi Fan,Andrew Cheung,Lik-hang Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper examines the perceptions and experiences of AI-CBT chatbots among Chinese graduate students, revealing cautious openness due to factors like usefulness, privacy concerns, and stigma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing concerns of mental well-being among graduate students and to understand how AI-CBT chatbots can potentially serve as scalable support solutions in Chinese contexts.

Method: Qualitative study using semi-structured Zoom interviews with ten Chinese graduate students. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted using the HBM and TPB frameworks.

Result: Participants exhibited cautious openness to AI-CBT chatbots, citing usefulness and access benefits. Barriers included concerns about data privacy, emotional safety, complexity of problems, and social norms.

Conclusion: The paper suggests culturally-sensitive design, transparent safeguards, and graduated care pathways to enhance the adoption and effectiveness of AI-CBT chatbots for mental well-being among Chinese students.

Abstract: The mental well-being of graduate students is an increasing concern, yet the adoption of scalable support remains uneven. Artificial intelligence-powered cognitive behavioral therapy chatbots (AI-CBT) offer low barrier help, but little is known about how Chinese postgraduates perceive and use them. This qualitative study explored perceptions and experiences of AI-CBT chatbots among ten Chinese graduate students recruited through social media. Semi-structured Zoom interviews were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, with the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as sensitizing frameworks. The findings indicate a cautious openness to AI-CBT chatbots: perceived usefulness and 24/7 access supported favorable attitudes, while data privacy, emotional safety, and uncertainty about `fit' for complex problems restricted the intention to use. Social norms (e.g., stigma and peer views) and perceived control (digital literacy, language quality) further shaped adoption. The study offers context-specific information to guide the culturally sensitive design, communication, and deployment of AI mental well-being tools for student populations in China and outlines the design implications around transparency, safeguards, and graduated care pathways.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how mobile robots can support blind individuals in group interactions, focusing on guided tours with mixed-visual groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind people face challenges in group interactions due to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting visual cues.

Method: The researchers conducted interviews with blind individuals and museum experts to design and prototype a robotic system. A field study involving blind participants in a science museum was carried out to test the system.

Result: Findings showed improved safety from the robot's navigational aid, issues regarding group participation, and preferences for environmental information.

Conclusion: The study highlights areas for improvement and provides design implications to enhance robotic systems for blind individuals in mixed-visual group settings.

Abstract: Group interactions are essential to social functioning, yet effective engagement relies on the ability to recognize and interpret visual cues, making such engagement a significant challenge for blind people. In this paper, we investigate how a mobile robot can support group interactions for blind people. We used the scenario of a guided tour with mixed-visual groups involving blind and sighted visitors. Based on insights from an interview study with blind people (n=5) and museum experts (n=5), we designed and prototyped a robotic system that supported blind visitors to join group tours. We conducted a field study in a science museum where each blind participant (n=8) joined a group tour with one guide and two sighted participants (n=8). Findings indicated users' sense of safety from the robot's navigational support, concerns in the group participation, and preferences for obtaining environmental information. We present design implications for future robotic systems to support blind people's mixed-visual group participation.

### [483] [The Supportiveness-Safety Tradeoff in LLM Well-Being Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04487)
*Himanshi Lalwani,Hanan Salam*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study examines how the level of supportiveness in prompts for large language models influences safety and care quality in socially assistive robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about how varying degrees of supportive framing in system prompts might impact the safety and effectiveness of LLMs in mental health applications.

Method: Evaluated 6 LLMs using 3 different supportiveness levels in prompts on synthetic queries related to well-being, employing an LLM judge framework validated against human ratings for safety and care quality.

Result: Moderately supportive prompts enhanced empathy and support without compromising safety, but excessively validating prompts led to reduced safety and care quality, with model-specific variability.

Conclusion: Balanced and thoughtful prompt design is crucial for safe and effective deployment of LLMs in mental health support applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being integrated into socially assistive robots (SARs) and other conversational agents providing mental health and well-being support. These agents are often designed to sound empathic and supportive in order to maximize user's engagement, yet it remains unclear how increasing the level of supportive framing in system prompts influences safety relevant behavior. We evaluated 6 LLMs across 3 system prompts with varying levels of supportiveness on 80 synthetic queries spanning 4 well-being domains (1440 responses). An LLM judge framework, validated against human ratings, assessed safety and care quality. Moderately supportive prompts improved empathy and constructive support while maintaining safety. In contrast, strongly validating prompts significantly degraded safety and, in some cases, care across all domains, with substantial variation across models. We discuss implications for prompt design, model selection, and domain specific safeguards in SARs deployment.

Motivation: Enhance tactile-based expressive robot research by reducing operational complexity, production costs, and improving gesture customizability.

Method: Developed a scalable cable-driven actuation system, implemented a four-layer decoupled software architecture, and connected human vocal input to robots' real-time emotional responses.

Result: Created soft robots with nuanced gestures, 'pleasant-to-touch' exteriors, and a user-friendly platform for tailored gesture construction.

Conclusion: PuppetAI offers a highly adaptable, accessible foundation for tactile expressive robot research, enabling researchers to innovate in social robot gesture designs.

Abstract: We introduce PuppetAI, a modular soft robot interaction platform. This platform offers a scalable cable-driven actuation system and a customizable, puppet-inspired robot gesture framework, supporting a multitude of interaction gesture robot design formats. The platform comprises a four-layer decoupled software architecture that includes perceptual processing, affective modeling, motion scheduling, and low-level actuation. We also implemented an affective expression loop that connects human input to the robot platform by producing real-time emotional gestural responses to human vocal input. For our own designs, we have worked with nuanced gestures enacted by "soft robots" with enhanced dexterity and "pleasant-to-touch" plush exteriors. By reducing operational complexity and production costs while enhancing customizability, our work creates an adaptable and accessible foundation for future tactile-based expressive robot research. Our goal is to provide a platform that allows researchers to independently construct or refine highly specific gestures and movements performed by social robots.

### [485] [Tinker Tales: Supporting Child-AI Collaboration through Co-Creative Storytelling with Educational Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04109)
*Nayoung Choi,Jiseung Hong,Peace Cyebukayire,Ikseon Choi,Jinho D. Choi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores child-AI co-creation in storytelling using Tinker Tales, a system incorporating tangible elements and AI interaction. A user study observed children's positive collaborative experiences with the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how children can engage with AI in collaborative and iterative storytelling, addressing a gap in studies on child-AI creative interactions outside of instructional contexts.

Method: The authors designed and utilized a system called Tinker Tales, including a tangible storytelling board, NFC-embedded toys, and a connected mobile app for voice-based child-AI interaction. An exploratory user study with 10 children was conducted.

Result: Children viewed the AI as a collaborative and responsive partner, with the scaffolding provided by the system enhancing narrative coherence while preserving children's creative agency.

Conclusion: Tinker Tales demonstrates the potential for meaningful child-AI collaboration in storytelling, supporting engagement, narrative structure, and creativity.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly framed as a collaborative partner in creative activities, yet children's interactions with AI have largely been studied in AI-led instructional settings rather than co-creative collaboration. This leaves open questions about how children can meaningfully engage with AI through iterative co-creation. We present Tinker Tales, a tangible storytelling system designed with narrative and social-emotional scaffolding to support child-AI collaboration. The system combines a physical storytelling board, NFC-embedded toys representing story elements (e.g., characters, places, items, and emotions), and a mobile app that mediates child-AI interaction. Children shape and refine stories by placing and moving story elements and interacting with the AI through tangible and voice-based interaction. We conducted an exploratory user study with 10 children to examine how they interacted with Tinker Tales. Our findings show that children treated the AI as an attentive, responsive collaborator, while scaffolding supported coherent narrative refinement without diminishing children's agency.

### [486] [Chaplains' Reflections on the Design and Usage of AI for Conversational Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04017)
*Joel Wester,Samuel Rhys Cox,Henning Pohl,Niels van Berkel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores chaplains' perceptions of conversational AI in providing emotional support in non-clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how conversational AI can support emotional well-being in non-clinical contexts where traditional clinical approaches may not apply.

Method: Eighteen chaplains were recruited to build AI chatbots and provide feedback on their use for pastoral care duties.

Result: The study identified themes of Listening, Connecting, Carrying, and Wanting that highlight both the possibilities and limitations of chatbots in non-clinical emotional support.

Conclusion: The insights on chaplains' views on AI provide a relational lens for designing conversational AI to better address emotional support in non-clinical environments.

Abstract: Despite growing recognition that responsible AI requires domain knowledge, current work on conversational AI primarily draws on clinical expertise that prioritises diagnosis and intervention. However, much of everyday emotional support needs occur in non-clinical contexts, and therefore requires different conversational approaches. We examine how chaplains, who guide individuals through personal crises, grief, and reflection, perceive and engage with conversational AI. We recruited eighteen chaplains to build AI chatbots. While some chaplains viewed chatbots with cautious optimism, the majority expressed limitations of chatbots' ability to support everyday well-being. Our analysis reveals how chaplains perceive their pastoral care duties and areas where AI chatbots fall short, along the themes of Listening, Connecting, Carrying, and Wanting. These themes resonate with the idea of attunement, recently highlighted as a relational lens for understanding the delicate experiences care technologies provide. This perspective informs chatbot design aimed at supporting well-being in non-clinical contexts.

*Saleh Afzoon,Amin Beheshti,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study introduces PersoPilot, an AI tool that integrates persona understanding with situational context to enhance service personalization and user interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in existing systems that treat user personas and context separately, limiting personalization potential.

Method: Developed PersoPilot, featuring a chat interface for end-users and a reasoning-driven labeling assistant for analysts, leveraging active learning for adaptive personalization.

Result: PersoPilot enables personalized recommendations, context-aware insights, and adaptive learning based on new data.

Conclusion: PersoPilot effectively links persona data with contextual information to enhance service personalization and is adaptable to diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding and classifying user personas is critical for delivering effective personalization. While persona information offers valuable insights, its full potential is realized only when contextualized, linking user characteristics with situational context to enable more precise and meaningful service provision. Existing systems often treat persona and context as separate inputs, limiting their ability to generate nuanced, adaptive interactions. To address this gap, we present PersoPilot, an agentic AI-Copilot that integrates persona understanding with contextual analysis to support both end users and analysts. End users interact through a transparent, explainable chat interface, where they can express preferences in natural language, request recommendations, and receive information tailored to their immediate task. On the analyst side, PersoPilot delivers a transparent, reasoning-powered labeling assistant, integrated with an active learning-driven classification process that adapts over time with new labeled data. This feedback loop enables targeted service recommendations and adaptive personalization, bridging the gap between raw persona data and actionable, context-aware insights. As an adaptable framework, PersoPilot is applicable to a broad range of service personalization scenarios.

*Xinyi Wen,Lena Hegemann,Xiaofu Jin,Shuai Ma,Antti Oulasvirta*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: APE (Adaptive Prompt Elicitation) is a technique to improve user intent alignment in text-to-image generation via interactive refinement prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of aligning text-to-image generation with ambiguous user inputs and model idiosyncrasies.

Method: APE uses an information-theoretic framework to infer user intent interactively, employing language model priors, visual queries, and adaptive intent elicitation to create effective prompts.

Result: APE demonstrated stronger alignment with user intent on IDEA-Bench and DesignBench, alongside a user study showing a 19.8% improvement without added workload.

Conclusion: APE provides a more efficient and principled approach to user interaction for text-to-image generation, making it accessible and effective for general users.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image generation with user intent remains challenging, for users who provide ambiguous inputs and struggle with model idiosyncrasies. We propose Adaptive Prompt Elicitation (APE), a technique that adaptively asks visual queries to help users refine prompts without extensive writing. Our technical contribution is a formulation of interactive intent inference under an information-theoretic framework. APE represents latent intent as interpretable feature requirements using language model priors, adaptively generates visual queries, and compiles elicited requirements into effective prompts. Evaluation on IDEA-Bench and DesignBench shows that APE achieves stronger alignment with improved efficiency. A user study with challenging user-defined tasks demonstrates 19.8% higher alignment without workload overhead. Our work contributes a principled approach to prompting that, for general users, offers an effective and efficient complement to the prevailing prompt-based interaction paradigm with text-to-image models.

### [490] [An Improved Boosted DC Algorithm for Nonsmooth Functions with Applications in Image Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04237)
*ZeYu Li,Te Qi,TieYong Zeng*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a monotone improved boosted DC algorithm (IBDCA) for non-smooth, non-convex DC problems, achieving better performance in convergence and application effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in solving non-smooth, non-convex DC optimization problems efficiently, particularly when classical methods struggle with monotone line search issues.

Method: Developed IBDCA that employs a monotone approach for a specific type of DC programs and ensures convergence by leveraging the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property.

Result: IBDCA demonstrates global convergence, monotonic decrease in objective value, and faster computational performance compared to DCA and other DC methods. Its effectiveness is shown in image recovery applications.

Conclusion: IBDCA is an advanced algorithm that enhances the performance of solving certain non-smooth DC problems, outperforming existing methods and ensuring robust convergence.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to perform the boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (BDCA) on non-smooth and non-convex problems involving the difference of convex (DC) functions. The recently proposed BDCA uses an extrapolation step from the point computed by the classical DC algorithm (DCA) via a line search procedure in a descent direction to get an additional decrease of the objective function and accelerate the convergence of DCA. However, when the first function in DC decomposition is non-smooth, the direction computed by BDCA can be ascent and a monotone line search cannot be performed. In this work, we proposed a monotone improved boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (IBDCA) for certain types of non-smooth DC programs, namely those that can be formulated as the difference of a possibly non-smooth function and a smooth one. We show that any cluster point of the sequence generated by IBDCA is a critical point of the problem under consideration and that the corresponding objective value is monotonically decreasing and convergent. We also present the global convergence and the convergent rate under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. The applications of IBDCA in image recovery show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The corresponding numerical experiments demonstrate that our IBDCA outperforms DCA and other state-of-the-art DC methods in both computational time and number of iterations.

*Bowen Tan,Qiong Wu,Pingyi Fan,Kezhi Wang,Nan Cheng,Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: A three-tier content caching architecture is proposed for vehicular fog caching-assisted platoons, incorporating large language models for intelligent and dynamic decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address content retrieval latency in Vehicular Fog Caching-assisted platoon systems while leveraging intelligent storage management across multiple tiers.

Method: The system organizes storage within local platoon vehicles, dynamic Vehicle Fog Clusters (VFCs), and a cloud server while utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent caching decisions via a prompting framework and hierarchical deterministic mapping.

Result: Simulation results show improved adaptive request prediction and precise content placement with minimized latency using the proposed caching strategy.

Conclusion: The architecture effectively utilizes LLMs and hierarchical strategies to optimize multi-tier content caching in vehicular platoon systems.

Abstract: This letter proposes a novel three-tier content caching architecture for Vehicular Fog Caching (VFC)-assisted platoon, where the VFC is formed by the vehicles driving near the platoon. The system strategically coordinates storage across local platoon vehicles, dynamic VFC clusters, and cloud server (CS) to minimize content retrieval latency. To efficiently manage distributed storage, we integrate large language models (LLMs) for real-time and intelligent caching decisions. The proposed approach leverages LLMs' ability to process heterogeneous information, including user profiles, historical data, content characteristics, and dynamic system states. Through a designed prompting framework encoding task objectives and caching constraints, the LLMs formulate caching as a decision-making task, and our hierarchical deterministic caching mapping strategy enables adaptive requests prediction and precise content placement across three tiers without frequent retraining. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed caching scheme.

*Hrishikesh Dutta,Roberto Minerva,Noel Crespi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin-enabled scheduling framework based on the Dual Mind World Model architecture, designed for adaptive, intelligent network control in dynamic environments. The framework outperforms traditional approaches in various network conditions while maintaining interpretability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of industrial IoT and cyber-physical infrastructures necessitates intelligent scheduling strategies that can adapt to dynamic traffic, deadlines, and interference, which conventional methods struggle to handle efficiently.

Method: A Digital Twin-enabled framework inspired by the DMWM architecture integrates short-horizon planning and symbolic model-based rollout for adaptive and future-predictive scheduling. It was implemented in a simulation testbed and benchmarked against traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning methods.

Result: The proposed DMWM scheduler outperformed traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning baselines in bursty, interference-limited, and deadline-sensitive environments, demonstrating better adaptability, interpretability, and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The DMWM-based design bridges the gap between network-level decision-making and efficient learning, contributing to scalable and adaptive network optimization in real-time settings.

Abstract: Emerging networked systems such as industrial IoT and real-time cyber-physical infrastructures demand intelligent scheduling strategies capable of adapting to dynamic traffic, deadlines, and interference constraints. In this work, we present a novel Digital Twin-enabled scheduling framework inspired by Dual Mind World Model (DMWM) architecture, for learning-informed and imagination-driven network control. Unlike conventional rule-based or purely data-driven policies, the proposed DMWM combines short-horizon predictive planning with symbolic model-based rollout, enabling the scheduler to anticipate future network states and adjust transmission decisions accordingly. We implement the framework in a configurable simulation testbed and benchmark its performance against traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning baselines under varied traffic conditions. Our results show that DMWM achieves superior performance in bursty, interference-limited, and deadline-sensitive environments, while maintaining interpretability and sample efficiency. The proposed design bridges the gap between network-level reasoning and low-overhead learning, marking a step toward scalable and adaptive NDT-based network optimization.
