### [2] [Teaching LLMs to Ask: Self-Querying Category-Theoretic Planning for Under-Specified Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20014)
*Shuhui Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called SQ-BCP for improving planning in large language models under partial observability by reducing task errors and maintaining plan quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitation of inference-time planning in large language models, which struggle under partial observability conditions by hallucinating facts or breaking constraints.

Method: The proposed SQ-BCP method explicitly tracks precondition statuses, resolves unknowns through self-queries or bridging hypotheses, and incorporates bidirectional search with a pullback-based verifier for goal compatibility.

Result: SQ-BCP outperforms baseline methods by significantly reducing resource-violation rates on WikiHow and RecipeNLG datasets while achieving competitive plan quality.

Conclusion: SQ-BCP demonstrates robustness in partial observability scenarios, offering reliable planning capabilities to tackle tasks with incomplete preconditions.

Abstract: Inference-time planning with large language models frequently breaks under partial observability: when task-critical preconditions are not specified at query time, models tend to hallucinate missing facts or produce plans that violate hard constraints. We introduce \textbf{Self-Querying Bidirectional Categorical Planning (SQ-BCP)}, which explicitly represents precondition status (\texttt{Sat}/\texttt{Viol}/\texttt{Unk}) and resolves unknowns via (i) targeted self-queries to an oracle/user or (ii) \emph{bridging} hypotheses that establish the missing condition through an additional action. SQ-BCP performs bidirectional search and invokes a pullback-based verifier as a categorical certificate of goal compatibility, while using distance-based scores only for ranking and pruning. We prove that when the verifier succeeds and hard constraints pass deterministic checks, accepted plans are compatible with goal requirements; under bounded branching and finite resolution depth, SQ-BCP finds an accepting plan when one exists. Across WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks with withheld preconditions, SQ-BCP reduces resource-violation rates to \textbf{14.9\%} and \textbf{5.8\%} (vs.\ \textbf{26.0\%} and \textbf{15.7\%} for the best baseline), while maintaining competitive reference quality.

### [3] [Fuzzy Categorical Planning: Autonomous Goal Satisfaction with Graded Semantic Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20021)
*Shuhui Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), a framework integrating fuzzy logic with category-theory for addressing vague predicates in planning. It demonstrates improved performance in recipe and benchmark planning tasks over several baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning often involves vague or graded predicates, which are not well-addressed by existing category-theoretic methods due to their crisp handling of applicability. This gap hinders effective planning in real-world scenarios where quality degrades over multi-step plans.

Method: FCP annotates actions with a [0,1] graded degree, composes quality via t-norm Lukasiewicz, and employs crisp executability checks through pullbacks. It grounds graded applicability via LLM-assisted median aggregation and applies residuum-based backward search strategies to support planning.

Result: FCP outperforms LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines on recipe substitution planning tasks and aligns competitively with classical PDDL3 planners, ensuring improved success rates and fewer constraint violations.

Conclusion: Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning effectively addresses the limitations of crisp applicability in existing planners, enabling graded predicate handling and improving performance on real-world and benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Natural-language planning often involves vague predicates (e.g., suitable substitute, stable enough) whose satisfaction is inherently graded. Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners.

### [4] [Insight Agents: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Data Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20048)
*Jincheng Bai,Zhenyu Zhang,Jennifer Zhang,Zhihuai Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, designed to assist E-commerce sellers in accessing and understanding data insights, with a 90% demonstrated accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges faced by E-commerce sellers, such as difficulty in discovering and using tools and analyzing data effectively.

Method: IA is an LLM-backed system based on a plan-and-execute paradigm. It includes a manager agent for task routing and worker agents for data presentation and insight generation. ML techniques like OOD detection and BERT-classification are used for optimization.

Result: IA was launched for Amazon sellers in the US, showing 90% accuracy (evaluated by humans) and latency of P90 under 15 seconds.

Conclusion: IA is effective in improving sellers' decision-making process by providing personalized insights, showing potential for broader adoption in the E-commerce domain.

Abstract: Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.

### [5] [Should I Have Expressed a Different Intent? Counterfactual Generation for LLM-Based Autonomous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20090)
*Amirmohammad Farzaneh,Salvatore D'Oro,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for counterfactual reasoning in language model-driven agents, ensuring reliability for user intent variation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for reliable counterfactual reasoning in language model-driven agents, where users seek to understand alternative outcomes of differently phrased intents.

Method: They model the user-agent-environment interaction as a structural causal model, applying test-time scaling for counterfactual outcome generation and leveraging conformal counterfactual generation for reliability.

Result: The framework significantly improves counterfactual analysis, as demonstrated in a wireless network control case, outperforming naive approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust and reliable way to evaluate counterfactual scenarios in LLM-powered applications, enhancing user understanding and interaction.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents can translate high-level user intents into plans and actions in an environment. Yet after observing an outcome, users may wonder: What if I had phrased my intent differently? We introduce a framework that enables such counterfactual reasoning in agentic LLM-driven control scenarios, while providing formal reliability guarantees. Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction. Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines.

### [6] [Towards Intelligent Urban Park Development Monitoring: LLM Agents for Multi-Modal Information Fusion and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20206)
*Zixuan Xiao,Chunguang Hu,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multi-modal LLM agent framework to improve urban park development monitoring by addressing limitations of traditional remote sensing methods and leveraging advanced semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring new urban park development is essential for evaluating urban planning impacts and optimizing resource use, but traditional methods lack high-level analysis capabilities and struggle with complex multi-modal data.

Method: The study introduces a multi-modal LLM agent framework featuring a data alignment mechanism for consistency, and a toolkit to reduce hallucination issues in LLM due to insufficient domain knowledge.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated robust multi-modal data fusion and analysis capabilities, outperforming existing GPT-4o and other agents in diverse application scenarios of urban park monitoring.

Conclusion: This multi-modal LLM agent framework offers scalable, reliable solutions for complex urban park development monitoring, meeting modern urban planning's evolving demands.

Abstract: As an important part of urbanization, the development monitoring of newly constructed parks is of great significance for evaluating the effect of urban planning and optimizing resource allocation. However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.

### [7] [Scaling Medical Reasoning Verification via Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20221)
*Hang Zhang,Ruheng Wang,Yuelyu Ji,Mingu Kwak,Xizhi Wu,Chenyu Li,Li Zhang,Wenqi Shi,Yifan Peng,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agentic framework, $ethod$, which improves verification of medical reasoning by iteratively querying external medical resources during evaluation. This leads to substantial accuracy improvements in benchmarks and decreases sampling budget requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel in medical reasoning but need rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy, especially in clinical applications.

Method: The paper proposes $ethod$, which combines iterative querying of external corpora, tool-augmented verification, reinforcement learning, and an adaptive curriculum mechanism for model training.

Result: $ethod$ achieves significant accuracy improvements across medical benchmarks (e.g., MedQA accuracy up by 23.5%) and reduces the sampling budget by 8x compared to prior reward models.

Conclusion: Dynamic evidence retrieval and iterative verification are effective methods to enhance the reliability of medical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, yet their deployment in clinical settings demands rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy. While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\method$ demonstrates an $\mathbf{8\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.

### [8] [Endogenous Reprompting: Self-Evolving Cognitive Alignment for Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20305)
*Zhenchen Tang,Songlin Yang,Zichuan Wang,Bo Peng,Yang Li,Beibei Dong,Jing Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the shortcomings of Unified Multimodal Models by proposing the SEER training framework, which enhances the model's generative reasoning using endogenous reprompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the Cognitive Gap in Unified Multimodal Models, where the models fail to utilize their strong understanding to improve their generative processes effectively.

Method: The authors propose SEER, a two-stage framework. It uses Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to activate and refine the model's evaluation capabilities and Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) to optimize generative reasoning, relying on a small-scale proxy task and endogenous reward signals.

Result: SEER demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality while maintaining multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the Cognitive Gap in multimodal models by transforming passive model understanding into active generative reasoning, improving generation quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) exhibit strong understanding, yet this capability often fails to effectively guide generation. We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities.

### [9] [ECG-Agent: On-Device Tool-Calling Agent for ECG Multi-Turn Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20323)
*Hyunseung Chung,Jungwoo Oh,Daeun Kyung,Jiho Kim,Yeonsu Kwon,Min-Gyu Kim,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ECG-Agent, a tool-calling LLM designed for multi-turn ECG dialogue, along with the ECG-MTD dataset for evaluation. The study highlights the performance and practicality of both on-device and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current multimodal LLMs applied to ECG tasks, such as the lack of multi-turn dialogue capability, on-device efficiency, and precise ECG measurement understanding.

Method: Develop ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue, and create ECG-MTD dataset containing realistic user-assistant dialogues with diverse configurations.

Result: ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy while on-device models show comparable results to larger agents across metrics like tool-calling ability and hallucination reduction.

Conclusion: ECG-Agents demonstrate their potential in real-world applications, combining multi-turn dialogue capability and on-device efficiency for diverse ECG analyses.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have rapidly expanded to electrocardiograms, focusing on classification, report generation, and single-turn QA tasks. However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy. Furthermore, on-device agents achieve comparable performance to larger agents in various evaluations that assess response accuracy, tool-calling ability, and hallucinations, demonstrating their viability for real-world applications.

### [10] [AMA: Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20352)
*Weiquan Huang,Zixuan Wang,Hehai Lin,Sudong Wang,Bo Xu,Qian Li,Beier Zhu,Linyi Yang,Chengwei Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMA, a novel framework for LLM memory management using multi-agent collaboration, effectively improving memory consistency and task-specific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current LLM memory systems, such as rigid retrieval mechanisms and logical inconsistencies, which impact long-term interaction and reasoning.

Method: AMA employs a multi-agent design, with components like Constructor, Retriever, Judge, and Refresher, to ensure adaptive memory retrieval, relevance verification, and consistency maintenance.

Result: AMA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on long-context benchmarks, reducing token usage by 80% while improving retrieval precision and consistency.

Conclusion: AMA provides a robust, adaptive memory system for LLMs that advances long-term reasoning capabilities and resolves issues of inefficiency and logical inconsistency.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has necessitated robust memory systems to support cohesive long-term interaction and complex reasoning. Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.

### [11] [Policy of Thoughts: Scaling LLM Reasoning via Test-time Policy Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20379)
*Zhengbo Jiao,Hongyu Xian,Qinglong Wang,Yunpu Ma,Zhebo Wang,Zifan Zhang,Dezhang Kong,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models suffer from limited reasoning abilities due to static policies. Policy of Thoughts (PoT) uses real-time feedback learning, substantially improving reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models traditionally struggle with complex reasoning due to fixed operational policies that don't adapt to errors during execution.

Method: Policy of Thoughts (PoT) introduces within-instance optimization through GRPO methodology, enabling real-time updates to reasoning strategies based on execution feedback.

Result: Experimental analysis shows significant performance improvements with PoT, allowing a 4B model to outperform larger models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The PoT framework shows great promise for advancing adaptive reasoning capabilities in language models, proving that smaller models can match or surpass larger ones with efficient optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.

### [12] [OmegaUse: Building a General-Purpose GUI Agent for Autonomous Task Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20380)
*Le Zhang,Yixiong Xiao,Xinjiang Lu,Jingjia Cao,Yusai Zhao,Jingbo Zhou,Lang An,Zikan Feng,Wanxiang Sha,Yu Shi,Congxi Xiao,Jian Xiong,Yankai Zhang,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmegaUse is a GUI agent model designed for autonomous task execution across mobile and desktop platforms, achieving state-of-the-art results in GUI benchmarks and introducing novel methodologies for data construction and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance human-computer interaction and productivity by developing a general-purpose GUI agent capable of autonomous task execution on diverse platforms.

Method: OmegaUse employs a two-stage training paradigm comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization and uses a Mixture-of-Experts backbone for efficiency. It also utilizes a novel data-construction pipeline combining autonomous exploration and taxonomy-guided generation to create synthetic data.

Result: OmegaUse achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 96.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot-V2 and competitive success rates on AndroidControl, ChiM-Nav, and Ubu-Nav benchmarks.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate OmegaUse's effectiveness as a cross-terminal GUI agent, showcasing its potential for improving interaction efficiency across mobile and desktop environments.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.

### [13] [CtrlCoT: Dual-Granularity Chain-of-Thought Compression for Controllable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20467)
*Zhenxuan Fan,Jie Cao,Yang Dai,Zheqi Lv,Wenqiao Zhang,Zhongle Xie,Peng LU,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CtrlCoT improves reasoning efficiency by compressing verbose reasoning traces while maintaining accuracy and logic-preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high latency and memory costs of verbose Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by enabling efficient compression while safeguarding task-critical cues and correctness.

Method: CtrlCoT employs a dual-granularity compression framework: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction creates multi-grain semantic traces, Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner, and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with reasoning styles.

Result: CtrlCoT cuts down token usage by 30.7% and improves performance by 7.6 percentage points on MATH-500 dataset, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CtrlCoT successfully balances compression and correctness using advanced techniques, enabling faster and more reliable large language model reasoning.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/fanzhenxuan/Ctrl-CoT.

Motivation: To investigate the influence of AI agents on the emergence and maintenance of cooperative social norms in small human groups, addressing a gap in existing research on human-AI interactions.

Method: The study conducted an online experiment with a repeated four-player Public Goods Game, including human participants and AI bots that followed varied decision strategies (cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding).

Result: The study found that cooperation was driven by group dynamics rather than the identity of agents (human or AI). Cooperation mechanisms and normative behaviours remained consistent across mixed human-AI and all-human groups.

Conclusion: Cooperative norms are adaptable and extend to AI agents, suggesting that the human-AI distinction may blur in collective decision-making environments.

Abstract: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.

### [15] [PathWise: Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20539)
*Oguzhan Gungordu,Siheng Xiong,Faramarz Fekri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes PathWise, a framework using multi-agent reasoning for improved heuristic design in combinatorial optimization problems, avoiding redundant evaluations and enabling state-aware planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of existing automated heuristic design frameworks, such as reliance on fixed rules and static prompts, leading to ineffective heuristic design and redundant computations.

Method: PathWise employs a multi-agent reasoning approach, where policies, world models, and critics interact using entailment graphs as state memory for heuristic design.

Result: PathWise demonstrates faster convergence, effective generalization across various LLMs, and scalability to larger optimization problems.

Conclusion: The study concludes that PathWise enhances heuristic design by transitioning to state-aware multi-agent reasoning, ensuring efficient and informed decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.

### [16] [Online Risk-Averse Planning in POMDPs Using Iterated CVaR Value Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20554)
*Yaacov Pariente,Vadim Indelman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops risk-sensitive planning methods utilizing Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR) for partially observable scenarios, extending algorithms to optimize for risk-sensitive objectives and demonstrating improved performance in lowering tail risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of standard planning methods that only optimize for expected returns, neglecting risk sensitivity, especially in uncertain settings characterized by partial observability.

Method: The authors introduce a policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR with finite-time performance guarantees, extend widely-used online planning algorithms to optimize ICVaR, and develop a novel exploration strategy tailored to risk-sensitive objectives.

Result: Extended algorithms like Sparse Sampling, PFT-DPW, and POMCPOW, optimized for ICVaR, demonstrate improved performance in lowering tail risk compared to risk-neutral counterparts, validated through benchmark POMDP experiments.

Conclusion: The study successfully shows that ICVaR-based planning performs better in lowering risks in partially observable scenarios, providing a robust framework for risk-sensitive decision-making.

Abstract: We study risk-sensitive planning under partial observability using the dynamic risk measure Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR). A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

*Gray Cox*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new empirical testing framework for AI alignment strategies, utilizing structured multi-model dialogue influenced by Peace Studies traditions to assess models' capacity for collaborative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reframe AI alignment from being a control problem to a relationship-building problem, focusing on dialogical reasoning inspired by Peace Studies concepts, to address the growing challenges of AI alignment.

Method: The paper designs experiments assigning distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to AI systems, with structured dialogue across six conditions using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o models.

Result: The results show that AI systems engaged substantively with Peace Studies concepts, generated novel insights like "VCW as transitional framework," and showed variability in concerns emphasized by different models (verification, bias, scalability, implementation issues).

Conclusion: The study concluded that structured AI dialogue can stress-test alignment proposals effectively, revealing AI's capacity for dialogical reasoning, while noting limitations about foundational claim engagement and proposing future directions for research.

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodological framework for empirically testing AI alignment strategies through structured multi-model dialogue. Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.
  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.
  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of "VCW as transitional framework." Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.
  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.

### [18] [Harder Is Better: Boosting Mathematical Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware GRPO and Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20614)
*Yanqi Dai,Yuxiang Ji,Xiao Zhang,Yong Wang,Xiangxiang Chu,Zhiwu Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning in large models by addressing the lack of emphasis on harder questions in existing reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is the observed lack of focus on challenging mathematical reasoning questions in existing methods, which are crucial for refining and improving underdeveloped capabilities in models.

Method: The proposed method, MathForge, comprises two main components: 1) Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) to balance difficulty and prioritize harder questions in policy optimization, and 2) Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) to generate more challenging data by reformulating questions. Together, these create a loop where MQR expands the training data and DGPO systematically learns from it.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods in various mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: MathForge enhances the learning of harder questions in mathematical reasoning through its dual approach, offering a promising advancement in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MathForge.

*Boaz Carmeli,Orr Paradise,Shafi Goldwasser,Yonatan Belinkov,Ron Meir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how LLM-based agents develop task-oriented communication, focusing on efficiency and covertness through referential games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if task-oriented communication in LLMs can progress towards efficiency and covertness, and evaluate their potential benefits and risks.

Method: The authors adopted a referential-game framework where vision-language model agents communicate to study language adaptations and coordination.

Result: The experiments show that VLM agents can create effective, task-specialized communication, including covert protocols that resist human or external interpretation.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents developing task-oriented communication highlight both opportunities and challenges regarding efficiency, covertness, and coordination potential.

Abstract: We investigate whether \emph{LLM-based agents} can develop task-oriented communication protocols that differ from standard natural language in collaborative reasoning tasks. Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient solutions for challenging optimization problems (JSP and KP) using modern deep learning methods.

Method: Utilize the Multi-Type Transformer (MTT) architecture for addressing JSP and KP within a unified framework.

Result: MTT shows competitive performance on benchmark datasets and is successfully applied in real manufacturing (Ferro-Titanium).

Conclusion: Multi-Type Transformers offer a promising approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems in both theoretical and practical applications.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems such as the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and Knapsack Problem (KP) are fundamental challenges in operations research, logistics, and eterprise resource planning (ERP). These problems often require sophisticated algorithms to achieve near-optimal solutions within practical time constraints. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced transformer-based architectures as promising alternatives to traditional heuristics and metaheuristics. We leverage the Multi-Type Transformer (MTT) architecture to address these benchmarks in a unified framework. We present an extensive experimental evaluation across standard benchmark datasets for JSP and KP, demonstrating that MTT achieves competitive performance on different size of these benchmark problems. We showcase the potential of multi-type attention on a real application in Ferro-Titanium industry. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply multi-type transformers in real manufacturing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational approach to Metric ASP for handling quantitative temporal constraints while overcoming scaling issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scalability in ASP when working with fine-grained temporal constraints.

Method: The approach uses ASP extensions with difference constraints to externally manage time-related calculations, decoupling them from time granularity.

Result: The developed method successfully mitigates the grounding bottleneck, making the solution independent of time precision.

Conclusion: This work advances ASP capabilities in dealing with temporal constraints efficiently and at large scales.

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constraints, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.

*Zishen Wan,Che-Kai Liu,Jiayi Qian,Hanchen Yang,Arijit Raychowdhury,Tushar Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces REASON, an acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI, achieving significant improvements in speed, energy efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying neuro-symbolic AI systems faces challenges due to inefficiencies in probabilistic logical reasoning, which hinders their practical scalability despite their superior performance in reasoning, planning, and verification.

Method: The authors propose REASON, integrating novel graph representations, adaptive pruning, and specialized hardware architecture. It combines a reconfigurable processing fabric and GPU interface for efficient execution.

Result: REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency compared to desktop and edge GPUs, enabling real-time probabilistic logical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: REASON significantly improves performance and efficiency for neuro-symbolic AI, establishing itself as a foundational architecture for future advancements in cognitive intelligence.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic AI systems integrate neural perception with symbolic reasoning to enable data-efficient, interpretable, and robust intelligence beyond purely neural models. Although this compositional paradigm has shown superior performance in domains such as reasoning, planning, and verification, its deployment remains challenging due to severe inefficiencies in symbolic and probabilistic inference. Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs.
  This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node. REASON enables real-time probabilistic logical reasoning, completing end-to-end tasks in 0.8 s with 6 mm2 area and 2.12 W power, demonstrating that targeted acceleration of probabilistic logical reasoning is critical for practical and scalable neuro-symbolic AI and positioning REASON as a foundational system architecture for next-generation cognitive intelligence.

*Vishnu Sashank Dorbala,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MemCtrl, a framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for online-driven memory pruning to enhance embodied agent task performance, achieving a 16% average improvement in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models face limitations in handling personalized decisions due to constrained memory contexts and rely on external systems, which are suboptimal for real-time, memory-limited agents. The research aims to address this limitation by developing an efficient memory management mechanism.

Method: MemCtrl uses Multimodal Large Language Models augmented with a memory head μ, which decides which observations or reflections to retain, discard, or update. It proposes two methods to train the memory head: through an offline expert or online reinforcement learning (RL).

Result: The implementation of MemCtrl on MLLMs demonstrated significant improvements in task completion performance, particularly with a 16% average performance improvement in benchmarks and over 20% on specific instruction subsets. The framework was especially effective on long and complex instruction types.

Conclusion: MemCtrl provides an effective solution to the memory constraints of embodied agents, improving task completion abilities through efficient online memory pruning. It showcases potential for enhancing multimodal language model-driven applications in constrained environments.

Abstract: Foundation models rely on in-context learning for personalized decision making. The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head μthat acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of μ, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on μ-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that μ-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by μ, noting the superior performance of μaugmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in the Parallel Scaling paradigm and improve efficiency in generating deep research-level reports.

Method: Utilized Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and Candidates Crossover algorithms, enabling dynamic adaptation and leveraging multiple LLM candidates.

Result: Achieved a score of 46.21 on the DeepResearch Bench, outperforming other leading research agents.

Conclusion: Sequential scaling demonstrates superior performance over parallel approaches, validating the efficacy of the Deep Researcher architecture.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Deep Researcher architecture designed to generate detailed research reports on complex PhD level topics by addressing the inherent limitations of the Parallel Scaling paradigm. Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard. This performance marginally exceeds our previous work, Static DRA, and reinforces the finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self consistency paradigm.

TL;DR: This paper assesses the long-horizon planning abilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using a novel Sokoban-based benchmark, revealing limitations in planning performance for tasks requiring over 25 moves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the gap in understanding of long-horizon planning abilities in Large Language Models, despite their demonstrated capabilities in other reasoning areas.

Method: The researchers designed a Sokoban puzzle benchmark that isolates long-horizon planning by simplifying state persistence and tested LRMs' performance on this benchmark.

Result: Performance degraded consistently for tasks requiring more than 25 moves, highlighting a constraint in forward planning. Adding tools like PDDL parsing showed only modest performance improvements.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that current architectural limitations prevent LRMs from excelling in long-horizon planning tasks, even with additional tools or scaling at test time.

Abstract: Although the capabilities of large language models have been increasingly tested on complex reasoning tasks, their long-horizon planning abilities have not yet been extensively investigated. In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows for modest improvements, suggesting inherent architectural limitations which might not be overcome by test-time scaling approaches alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bit-truncation memory designs lack flexibility and require custom designs for specific applications, limiting their broader applicability.

Method: An innovative bit-truncation memory is introduced that dynamically truncates any number of bits during runtime, catering to diverse quality-power trade-offs for multiple applications.

Result: The proposed memory improved power efficiency up to 47.02% in video processing and up to 51.69% in deep learning applications, with minimal silicon area overhead.

Conclusion: This adaptable memory solution enables efficient deployment of approximate applications across different edge environments, balancing quality and power effectively.

Abstract: Bit truncation has demonstrated great potential to enable run-time quality-power adaptive data storage, thereby optimizing the power/energy efficiency of approximate applications and supporting their deployment in edge environments. However, existing bit-truncation memories require custom designs for a specific application. In this paper, we present a novel bit-truncation memory with full adaptation flexibility, which can truncate any number of data bits at run time to meet different quality and power trade-off requirements for various approximate applications. The developed bit-truncation memory has been applied to two representative data-intensive approximate applications: video processing and deep learning. Our experiments show that the proposed memory can support three different video applications (including luminance-aware, content-aware, and region-of-interest-aware) with enhanced power efficiency (up to 47.02% power savings) as compared to state-of-the-art. In addition, the proposed memory achieves significant (up to 51.69%) power savings for both baseline and pruned lightweight deep learning models, respectively, with a low implementation cost (2.89% silicon area overhead).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing application of LLMs in hardware design, particularly in HLS, and the increasing interest in leveraging these models requires a structured benchmarking framework to evaluate their performance in HLS workflows.

Method: Developed Bench4HLS, a framework with 170 manually curated case studies, automated evaluation capabilities (including compilation success, simulation correctness, and synthesis feasibility), and a pluggable API for power, performance, and area analysis.

Result: Bench4HLS demonstrates robust capability to evaluate LLM-generated HLS designs and assesses performance with tools like Xilinx Vitis HLS and validation on Catapult HLS.

Conclusion: Bench4HLS serves as an extensible, structured platform for benchmarking LLM-based solutions in HLS, contributing to advancing research and performance evaluation in this domain.

Abstract: In last two years, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code generation, including hardware design at register-transfer level (RTL). While their use in high-level synthesis (HLS) remains comparatively less mature, the ratio of HLS- to RTL-focused studies has shifted from 1:10 to 2:10 in the past six months, indicating growing interest in leveraging LLMs for high-level design entry while relying on downstream synthesis for optimization. This growing trend highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation framework dedicated to LLM-based HLS. To address this, We present Bench4HLS for evaluating LLM-generated HLS designs. Bench4HLS comprises 170 manually drafted and validated case studies, spanning small kernels to complex accelerators, curated from widely used public repositories. The framework supports fully automated assessment of compilation success, functional correctness via simulation, and synthesis feasibility/optimization. Crucially, Bench4HLS integrates a pluggable API for power, performance, and area (PPA) analysis across various HLS toolchains and architectures, demonstrated here with Xilinx Vitis HLS and validated on Catapult HLS. By providing a structured, extensible, and plug-and-play testbed, Bench4HLS establishes a foundational methodology for benchmarking LLMs in HLS workflows.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hardware-aware model for retraining analog neural networks to recover ideal inference accuracy despite non-idealities in silicon implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of non-idealities in silicon analog neural networks without relying on energy-intensive and costly calibration and conservative analog design techniques.

Method: Develop a physics-informed hardware-aware model that considers capacitive crosstalk and bit-line voltage drop in silicon-based time-domain vector-matrix multipliers and integrates into modern deep learning workflows.

Result: Calibration with a 16x16 silicon array reveals crosstalk's dominance and layout-dependency, improves weight extraction procedure, doubles signal-to-error ratio, and successfully retrains analog networks to match ideal software network accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: The hardware-aware model enables scalable and energy-efficient analog neural networks, preserving inference accuracy without costly calibration, demonstrating a robust design-to-deployment framework.

Abstract: Silicon-based analog neural networks physically embody the ideal neural network model in an approximate way. We show that by retraining the neural network using a physics-informed hardware-aware model one can fully recover the inference accuracy of the ideal network model even in the presence of significant non-idealities. This is way more promising for scalability and integration density than the default option of improving the fidelity of the analog neural network at the cost of significant energy, area, and design overhead, through extensive calibration and conservative analog design.
  We first present a physics-informed hardware-aware model for a time-domain vector-matrix multiplier implemented with single-transistor floating-gate memory cells that explicitly accounts for two dominant non-idealities of the physical implementation - capacitive crosstalk and bit-line voltage drop - and integrates seamlessly with modern deep-learning workflows. The model discretizes each operation into adaptive time slots, processes activation patterns in parallel, and accumulates their contributions to predict effective multiplier outputs. Using measurements from a 16x16 silicon array, we calibrate the model, show that crosstalk is layout-dependent and often dominant, and introduce an improved weight-extraction procedure that doubles signal-to-error ratio versus an ideal vector-matrix multiplier model. Finally, we show that by training silicon-based analog neural networks using an hardware-aware model in the forward pass we can recover the accuracy of the ideal software networks across three architectures -- custom MLP on low-resolution MNIST, LeNet-5 on MNIST, and a VGG-style CNN on CIFAR-10 - establishing a complete design-to-deployment workflow for time-domain analog neuromorphic chips.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of uneven wear in computer memory, which is crucial for reducing e-waste and enhancing sustainability, particularly in emerging memory types with shorter lifespans like phase-change memory.

Method: A wear-leveling method inspired by the golden ratio to model memory as two rings combined with garbage collection techniques for adaptive, hardware-independent memory management.

Result: The proposed method effectively reduces memory wear, extends its lifespan, and achieves seamless integration without compromising program execution speed or necessitating hardware modifications.

Conclusion: Dual-ring wear leveling offers a sustainable and efficient solution for overcoming uneven memory wear, emphasizing adaptability and practicality while advancing the utility of memory management techniques.

Abstract: Lengthening a computer memory's lifespan is important for e-waste and sustainability. Uneven wear of memory is a major barrier. The problem is becoming even more urgent as emerging memory such as phase-change memory is subject to even shorter lifespan. Various solutions have been proposed, but they either require complicated hardware extensions or apply only to certain program constructs such as loops. This research proposes a new method, dual-ring wear leveling. It takes inspiration from the natural law known as the ``golden ratio" and how it helps flower petals evenly receive sun lights. By modeling memory as two rings and combines the idea with existing memory management, garbage collection, the new solution offers an effective way to reduce memory wear and hence lengthen memory lifespan. It is deterministic, able to automatically adapt to memory size, requiring no hardware changes, and adding no slowdown to program executions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of manual SVA generation, which is slow and prone to errors, and improve upon existing LLM-based approaches that do not effectively utilize structural patterns.

Method: STELLAR employs AST structural fingerprints of RTL blocks to retrieve relevant (RTL, SVA) pairs from a knowledge base, integrating them into structure-guided prompts for enhanced SVA generation.

Result: STELLAR demonstrates superior syntax correctness, stylistic alignment, and functional correctness in SVA generation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Structure-aware retrieval is a promising approach for improving the efficiency and quality of assertion generation in formal verification tasks, as demonstrated by STELLAR’s performance.

Abstract: Formal Verification (FV) relies on high-quality SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs), but the manual writing process is slow and error-prone. Existing LLM-based approaches either generate assertions from scratch or ignore structural patterns in hardware designs and expert-crafted assertions. This paper presents STELLAR, the first framework that guides LLM-based SVA generation with structural similarity. STELLAR represents RTL blocks as AST structural fingerprints, retrieves structurally relevant (RTL, SVA) pairs from a knowledge base, and integrates them into structure-guided prompts. Experiments show that STELLAR achieves superior syntax correctness, stylistic alignment, and functional correctness, highlighting structure-aware retrieval as a promising direction for industrial FV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APSP computations have high data movement complexity that overwhelms memory bandwidth in large-scale graph analytics, necessitating more efficient solutions.

Method: The researchers co-designed RAPID-Graph, integrating algorithmic, architectural, and device-level optimizations. They introduced a recursion-aware partitioner for graph decomposition and designed a 2.5D PIM stack with multiple components for efficient computation and storage.

Result: RAPID-Graph achieved significant improvements: 5.8x faster and 1,186x more energy-efficient than GPU clusters, and 42.8x faster and 392x more energy-efficient compared to an NVIDIA H100 GPU.

Conclusion: RAPID-Graph demonstrates that co-designing PIM systems can overcome APSP computational bottlenecks through advanced integration of algorithms, architectures, and memory technology.

Abstract: All-pairs shortest paths (APSP) remains a major bottleneck for large-scale graph analytics, as data movement with cubic complexity overwhelms the bandwidth of conventional memory hierarchies. In this work, we propose RAPID-Graph to address this challenge through a co-designed processing-in-memory (PIM) system that integrates algorithm, architecture, and device-level optimizations. At the algorithm level, we introduce a recursion-aware partitioner that enables an exact APSP computation by decomposing graphs into vertex tiles to reduce data dependency, such that both Floyd-Warshall and Min-Plus kernels execute fully in-place within digital PIM arrays. At the architecture and device levels, we design a 2.5D PIM stack integrating two phase-change memory compute dies, a logic die, and high-bandwidth scratchpad memory within a unified advanced package. An external non-volatile storage stack stores large APSP results persistently. The design achieves both tile-level and unit-level parallel processing to sustain high throughput. On the 2.45M-node OGBN-Products dataset, RAPID-Graph is 5.8x faster and 1,186x more energy efficient than state-of-the-art GPU clusters, while exceeding prior PIM accelerators by 8.3x in speed and 104x in efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHIME, a chiplet-based hardware framework to improve inference efficiency of multimodal language models (MLLMs) on edge devices, achieving significant speedup and energy efficiency over existing hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the latency, energy, and data movement challenges in executing multimodal language models (MLLMs) on edge devices with limited resources and intermittent connectivity.

Method: The authors design CHIME, a heterogeneous hardware combining M3D DRAM and RRAM chiplets for near-memory computation. A co-designed mapping framework is used to minimize data movement and optimize performance.

Result: CHIME delivers significant improvements, achieving up to 54x speedup and 246x better energy efficiency compared to NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX. It also sustains far higher token throughput and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: CHIME proves effective in addressing edge inference challenges for MLLMs, combining hardware innovations and mapping strategies to enhance both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) is accelerating the integration of multimodal assistants into edge devices, where inference is executed under stringent latency and energy constraints, often exacerbated by intermittent connectivity. These challenges become particularly acute in the context of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), as high-dimensional visual inputs are transformed into extensive token sequences, thereby inflating the key-value (KV) cache and imposing substantial data movement overheads to the LLM backbone. To address these issues, we present CHIME, a chiplet-based heterogeneous near-memory acceleration for edge MLLMs inference. CHIME leverages the complementary strengths of integrated monolithic 3D (M3D) DRAM and RRAM chiplets: DRAM supplies low-latency bandwidth for attention, while RRAM offers dense, non-volatile storage for weights. This heterogeneous hardware is orchestrated by a co-designed mapping framework that executes fused kernels near data, minimizing cross-chiplet traffic to maximize effective bandwidth. On FastVLM (0.6B/1.7B) and MobileVLM (1.7B/3B), CHIME achieves up to 54x speedup and up to 246x better energy efficiency per inference as compared to the edge GPU NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX. It sustains 116.5-266.5 token/J compared to Jetson's 0.7-1.1 token/J. Furthermore, it delivers up to 69.2x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art PIM accelerator FACIL. Compared to the M3D DRAM-only design, CHIME's heterogeneous memory further improves energy efficiency by 7% and performance by 2.4x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the severe bottlenecks caused by PCIe bandwidth limitations in facilitating long-context LLM inference with KV cache offloading.

Method: The paper develops an analytical framework to derive a critical cached-to-prefill token ratio ($κ_{crit}$), conducts empirical characterizations of latency and GPU efficiency, and suggests optimizations for hardware, model architectures, and algorithms.

Result: Empirical results show 99% of latency is spent on data transfers, GPUs consume only 28% of their rated power under these conditions, and typical workloads exceed the derived critical token ratio by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Current offloading approaches create significant inefficiencies; targeted optimizations are necessary to improve GPU utilization, reduce latency, and alleviate PCIe bandwidth bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: KV cache offloading enables long-context LLM inference by storing caches in CPU DRAM, but PCIe bandwidth limitations create severe bottlenecks. In this paper, we develops an analytical framework that derives $κ_{\text{crit}}$, the critical cached-to-prefill token ratio where execution becomes memory-bound and show typical workloads exceed this threshold by orders of magnitude. Empirical characterization reveals 99\% of latency spent on transfers and serving offloaded requests results in GPU's consuming only 28\% of their rated TDP, motivating our proposed optimizations for hardware interconnects, model architectures, and scheduling algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper addresses CPU bottlenecks in OLAP systems by proposing a hybrid architecture with selective GPU offloading and risk-aware gating for efficient execution-layer optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address new CPU bottlenecks in modern OLAP systems (e.g., Top-K selection and join probe) as systems scale, despite I/O bottlenecks being mitigated with storage-compute separation and columnar layouts.

Method: The paper introduces a hybrid execution architecture combining existing vectorized execution with selective, high-impact GPU offloading while minimizing data movement using key-only transfer and late materialization. A Risky Gate mechanism is employed to determine when GPU offloading is beneficial based on calculated cost intervals.

Result: Experiments using PostgreSQL microbenchmarks show improved tail latency (P95/P99) under risk-aware GPU offloading compared to always-on GPU execution.

Conclusion: Selective GPU offloading with risk-aware gating can efficiently address CPU bottlenecks in OLAP systems, extending such risk-aware principles to execution-layer optimization.

Abstract: Modern OLAP systems have mitigated I/O bottlenecks via storage-compute separation and columnar layouts, but CPU costs in the execution layer (especially Top-K selection and join probe) are emerging as new bottlenecks at scale. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture that augments existing vectorized execution by selectively offloading only high-impact primitives to the GPU. To reduce data movement, we use key-only transfer (keys and pointers) with late materialization. We further introduce a Risky Gate (risk-aware gating) that triggers offloading only in gain/risk intervals based on input size, transfer, kernel and post-processing costs, and candidate-set complexity (K, M). Using PostgreSQL microbenchmarks and GPU proxy measurements, we observe improved tail latency (P95/P99) under gated offloading compared to always-on GPU offloading. This work extends the risk-aware gating principle used for optimizer-stage GPU-assisted measurement (arXiv:2512.19750) to execution-layer OLAP primitives.

*Duo Chai,Zizhen Liu,Shuhuai Wang,Songwei Pei,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li,Shangguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This study investigates the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in handling GPU soft errors, introducing a method to analyze their resilience through instruction-level fault injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are compute- and memory-intensive, and their rapid adoption highlights the need to understand their vulnerability to GPU soft errors, which prior studies have not systematically analyzed.

Method: The study employs an instruction-level fault injection approach to evaluate LLM inference reliability, considering model architecture, scale, and task complexity.

Result: The study identifies multiple reliability characteristics, showing how model-specific features influence resilience to soft errors.

Conclusion: Insights from this analysis contribute to designing improved fault tolerance mechanisms tailored for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly compute- and memory-intensive, posing significant demands on high-performance GPUs. At the same time, advances in GPU technology driven by shrinking transistor sizes and lower operating voltages have made these devices increasingly susceptible to soft errors. While prior work has examined GPU reliability, most studies have focused on general-purpose applications or conventional neural networks mostly used for vision tasks such as classification and detection. In contrast, systematic analysis of modern large-scale LLMs remains limited, despite their rapid adoption in diverse application scenarios. Given the unique characteristics of LLMs, their resilience to soft errors may differ substantially from earlier models. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first instruction-level fault injection study of LLM inference. Our approach reveals reliability characteristics from multiple perspectives, highlighting the effects of model architecture, parameter scale, and task complexity. These findings provide new insights into LLM reliability and inform the design of more effective fault tolerance mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) achieve efficient computation but still rely on full precision operations in some layers. PiC-BNN introduces an end-to-end binary accelerator leveraging Hamming tolerance for classification. It achieves software-level accuracy on MNIST and HG datasets with high power efficiency and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve BNN efficiency by eliminating dependence on full precision operations and enabling accurate classification through a fully binary architecture.

Method: A binary accelerator (PiC-BNN) is designed using Content Addressable Memory and Hamming tolerance, eliminating full precision operations in BNNs. The design is implemented and manufactured using a 65nm process.

Result: PiC-BNN achieves 95.2% classification accuracy on MNIST, 93.5% on HG, 560K inferences per second throughput, and power efficiency of 703M inferences/s/W.

Conclusion: PiC-BNN demonstrates that a true end-to-end binary architecture can achieve comparable accuracy and efficiency for BNNs while eliminating the need for architectural support for full precision operations.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), where weights and activations are constrained to binary values (+1, -1), are a highly efficient alternative to traditional neural networks. Unfortunately, typical BNNs, while binarizing linear layers (matrix-vector multiplication), still implement other network layers (batch normalization, softmax, output layer, and sometimes the input layer of a convolutional neural network) in full precision. This limits the area and energy benefits and requires architectural support for full precision operations. We propose PiC-BNN, a true end-to-end binary in-approximate search (Hamming distance tolerant) Content Addressable Memory based BNN accelerator. PiC-BNN is designed and manufactured in a commercial 65nm process. PiC-BNN uses Hamming distance tolerance to apply the law of large numbers to enable accurate classification without implementing full precision operations. PiC-BNN achieves baseline software accuracy (95.2%) on the MNIST dataset and 93.5% on the Hand Gesture (HG) dataset, a throughput of 560K inferences/s, and presents a power efficiency of 703M inferences/s/W when implementing a binary MLP model for MNIST/HG dataset classification.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced image encoder based on Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) and an FPGA accelerator that significantly speeds up HDC operations, achieving state-of-the-art performance and low latency. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently performing Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) operations is challenging on conventional processors due to high dimensionality, sparsity, and repeated data movement, especially in real-time applications.

Method: This paper develops a spatially enriched image-encoding algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks, mapping local image patches to hypervectors. Additionally, it designs an FPGA-based pipelined architecture to accelerate HDC operations using parallelism.

Result: The proposed HDC image encoder achieves 95.67% accuracy on MNIST and 85.14% on Fashion-MNIST, surpassing prior HDC-based encoders. The FPGA implementation delivers 0.09ms inference latency with up to 1300x speedup over CPUs and 60x over GPUs.

Conclusion: The new algorithm and FPGA accelerator make Hyperdimensional Computing practical and competitive for image encoding tasks, providing significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) represents data using extremely high-dimensional, low-precision vectors, termed hypervectors (HVs), and performs learning and inference through lightweight, noise-tolerant operations. However, the high dimensionality, sparsity, and repeated data movement involved in HDC make these computations difficult to accelerate efficiently on conventional processors. As a result, executing core HDC operations: binding, permutation, bundling, and similarity search: on CPUs or GPUs often leads to suboptimal utilization, memory bottlenecks, and limits on real-time performance. In this paper, our contributions are two-fold. First, we develop an image-encoding algorithm that, similar in spirit to convolutional neural networks, maps local image patches to hypervectors enriched with spatial information. These patch-level hypervectors are then merged into a global representation using the fundamental HDC operations, enabling spatially sensitive and robust image encoding. This encoder achieves 95.67% accuracy on MNIST and 85.14% on Fashion-MNIST, outperforming prior HDC-based image encoders. Second, we design an end-to-end accelerator that implements these compute operations on an FPGA through a pipelined architecture that exploits parallelism both across the hypervector dimensionality and across the set of image patches. Our Alveo U280 implementation delivers 0.09ms inference latency, achieving up to 1300x and 60x speedup over state-of-the-art CPU and GPU baselines, respectively.

*Maxwell Phillips,Firas Hassan,Ahmed Ammar*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel way to design priority encoders, reducing complexity while balancing delay. It evaluates multiple architectures and offers a practical guide for hardware designers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Priority encoders are critical but traditionally complex components for high input lengths. The study seeks to simplify their design to improve application performance in key areas like integer arithmetic and content-addressable memory.

Method: The authors generalize a previously proposed two-level encoder structure, introducing three and four levels using cascading and composition techniques. They analyze various designs' complexity and delay across FPGA and ASIC platforms, comparing them with single-level, tree-based, recursive, and two-level designs.

Result: The two-level structure offers reduced complexity (~50%) but with increased delay. Additional levels show diminishing returns. Tree and recursive designs are faster but more complex. The study provides performance insights and recommendations based on input length and technology.

Conclusion: The paper provides a 'priority encoder toolkit' for hardware designers, balancing complexity and delay considerations for optimal designs tailored to input length and technology.

Abstract: Priority encoders are typically considered expensive hardware components in terms of complexity, especially at high bit precisions or input lengths (e.g., above 512 bits). However, if the complexity can be reduced, priority encoders can feasibly accelerate a variety of key applications, such as high-precision integer arithmetic and content-addressable memory. We propose a new paradigm for constructing priority encoders by generalizing the previously proposed two-level priority encoder structure. We extend this concept to three and four levels using two techniques -- cascading and composition -- and discuss further generalization. We then analyze the complexity and delay of new and existing priority encoder designs as a function of input length, for both FPGA and ASIC implementation technologies. In particular, we compare the multi-level structure to the traditional single-level priority encoder structure, a tree-based design, a recursive design, and the two-level structure. We find that the two-level architecture provides balanced performance -- reducing complexity by around half, but at the cost of a corresponding increase in delay. Additional levels have diminishing returns, highlighting a tradeoff between complexity and delay. Meanwhile, the tree and recursive designs are generally faster, but are more complex than the two-level and multi-level structures. We explore several characteristics and patterns of the designs across a wide range of input lengths. We then provide recommendations on which architecture to use for a given input length and implementation technology, based on which design factors -- such as complexity or delay -- are most important to the hardware designer. With this overview and analysis of various priority encoder architectures, we provide a priority encoder toolkit to assist hardware designers in creating the most optimal design.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes inefficiencies in the sampling phase of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) on GPUs and proposes an optimized NPU architecture as a solution, improving performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in the sampling phase of dLLMs, which consume up to 70% of model inference latency due to substantial memory overheads and irregular access patterns.

Method: The authors developed specific optimizations for NPU architecture, including lightweight vector primitives, in-place memory reuse, and a decoupled mixed-precision memory hierarchy.

Result: The optimizations achieved a 2.53x speedup over NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU performance when evaluated under equivalent technology nodes.

Conclusion: Their optimized NPU architecture substantially improves the efficiency of dLLM sampling, and the implementation has been validated through cycle-accurate simulations and RTL verification tools.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduce iterative denoising to enable parallel token generation, but their sampling phase displays fundamentally different characteristics compared to GEMM-centric transformer layers. Profiling on modern GPUs reveals that sampling can account for up to 70% of total model inference latency-primarily due to substantial memory loads and writes from vocabulary-wide logits, reduction-based token selection, and iterative masked updates. These processes demand large on-chip SRAM and involve irregular memory accesses that conventional NPUs struggle to handle efficiently. To address this, we identify a set of critical instructions that an NPU architecture must specifically optimize for dLLM sampling. Our design employs lightweight non-GEMM vector primitives, in-place memory reuse strategies, and a decoupled mixed-precision memory hierarchy. Together, these optimizations deliver up to a 2.53x speedup over the NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU under an equivalent nm technology node. We also open-source our cycle-accurate simulation and post-synthesis RTL verification code, confirming functional equivalence with current dLLM PyTorch implementations.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper examines progress in NVIDIA datacenter GPUs since the mid-2000s, identifying trends in computational performance, memory, price, and power consumption. It also assesses potential impacts of U.S. GPU export controls on performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to analyze historical and current trends in GPU architectures to understand progress and future constraints, especially in the context of AI advancements and export control regulations.

Method: The authors compiled a dataset of NVIDIA datacenter GPUs, analyzing features like computational performance, price, and power consumption. They estimated trends and indicators for performance improvements, memory, pricing, and implications of export controls.

Result: Findings include performance doubling times for FP16 (1.44 years), FP32 (1.69 years), and FP64 (2.06 - 3.79 years) operations. Memory bandwidth doubling occurs slower, every 3.32 to 3.53 years, while prices double every 5.1 years and power consumption every 16 years. Export controls significantly reduce global performance gaps.

Conclusion: NVIDIA GPUs have progressed rapidly in performance relative to memory and efficiency metrics. However, export regulations may significantly impact global performance equity in AI-related GPUs, with narrowing performance disparities under tightened controls.

Abstract: Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the state-of-the-art architecture for essential tasks, ranging from rendering 2D/3D graphics to accelerating workloads in supercomputing centers and, of course, Artificial Intelligence (AI). As GPUs continue improving to satisfy ever-increasing performance demands, analyzing past and current progress becomes paramount in determining future constraints on scientific research. This is particularly compelling in the AI domain, where rapid technological advancements and fierce global competition have led the United States to recently implement export control regulations limiting international access to advanced AI chips. For this reason, this paper studies technical progress in NVIDIA datacenter GPUs released from the mid-2000s until today. Specifically, we compile a comprehensive dataset of datacenter NVIDIA GPUs comprising several features, ranging from computational performance to release price. Then, we examine trends in main GPU features and estimate progress indicators for per-memory bandwidth, per-dollar, and per-watt increase rates. Our main results identify doubling times of 1.44 and 1.69 years for FP16 and FP32 operations (without accounting for sparsity benefits), while FP64 doubling times range from 2.06 to 3.79 years. Off-chip memory size and bandwidth grew at slower rates than computing performance, doubling every 3.32 to 3.53 years. The release prices of datacenter GPUs have roughly doubled every 5.1 years, while their power consumption has approximately doubled every 16 years. Finally, we quantify the potential implications of current U.S. export control regulations in terms of the potential performance gaps that would result if implementation were assumed to be complete and successful. We find that recently proposed changes to export controls would shrink the potential performance gap from 23.6x to 3.54x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of transformers' quadratic scaling complexity in attention, aiming to boost hardware implementation.

Method: The paper introduces SATA, a locality-centric scheduling scheme optimizing Query-Key operations via operand flow reordering and better exploitation of data locality.

Result: SATA improves system throughput by up to 1.76x and energy efficiency by 2.94x, with negligible scheduling overhead.

Conclusion: SATA provides a practical solution for efficient transformer models, enhancing computation performance and energy usage without substantial overhead.

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundation of numerous state-of-the-art AI models across diverse domains, thanks to their powerful attention mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic scaling complexity of attention poses significant challenges for efficient hardware implementation. While techniques such as quantization and pruning help mitigate this issue, selective token attention offers a promising alternative by narrowing the attention scope to only the most relevant tokens, reducing computation and filtering out noise.
  In this work, we propose SATA, a locality-centric dynamic scheduling scheme that proactively manages sparsely distributed access patterns from selective Query-Key operations. By reordering operand flow and exploiting data locality, our approach enables early fetch and retirement of intermediate Query/Key vectors, improving system utilization. We implement and evaluate our token management strategy in a control and compute system, using runtime traces from selective-attention-based models. Experimental results show that our method improves system throughput by up to 1.76x and boosts energy efficiency by 2.94x, while incurring minimal scheduling overhead.

*Yipu Zhang,Jintao Cheng,Xingyu Liu,Zeyu Li,Carol Jingyi Li,Jin Wu,Lin Jiang,Yuan Xie,Jiang Xu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: VersaQ-3D proposes a quantization and accelerator framework for the VGGT model, achieving efficient 3D reconstruction by addressing memory, compute, and hardware limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the impracticality of deploying memory and compute-intensive VGGT models for 3D reconstruction on edge devices, hindered by existing quantization shortcomings and hardware challenges.

Method: Introduces VersaQ-3D, a framework combining a novel 4-bit calibration-free quantization algorithm using orthogonal transforms and a reconfigurable accelerator with efficient systolic datapaths and recomputation techniques.

Result: VersaQ-3D preserves 98-99% model accuracy at low precision (W4A8) and achieves up to 2.39x performance improvement over prior methods and 5.2x-10.8x speedup over edge GPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed quantization and accelerator framework enables practical and efficient on-device 3D reconstruction with high accuracy and reduced power consumption.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) enables strong feed-forward 3D reconstruction without per-scene optimization. However, its billion-parameter scale creates high memory and compute demands, hindering on-device deployment. Existing LLM quantization methods fail on VGGT due to saturated activation channels and diverse 3D semantics, which cause unreliable calibration. Furthermore, VGGT presents hardware challenges regarding precision-sensitive nonlinear operators and memory-intensive global attention. To address this, we propose VersaQ-3D, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework. Algorithmically, we introduce the first calibration-free, scene-agnostic quantization for VGGT down to 4-bit, leveraging orthogonal transforms to decorrelate features and suppress outliers. Architecturally, we design a reconfigurable accelerator supporting BF16, INT8, and INT4. A unified systolic datapath handles both linear and nonlinear operators, reducing latency by 60%, while two-stage recomputation-based tiling alleviates memory pressure for long-sequence attention. Evaluations show VersaQ-3D preserves 98-99% accuracy at W4A8. At W4A4, it outperforms prior methods by 1.61x-2.39x across diverse scenes. The accelerator delivers 5.2x-10.8x speedup over edge GPUs with low power, enabling efficient instant 3D reconstruction.

### [45] [From Intuition to Expertise: Rubric-Based Cognitive Calibration for Human Detection of LLM-Generated Korean Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19913)
*Shinwoo Park,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates whether experts can improve detection of AI-generated Korean text through structured calibration and presents LREAD, a rubric to enhance this ability. Results showed experts improved from 60% to 100% in detection accuracy using LREAD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of distinguishing human-written Korean text from highly fluent AI-generated outputs, which even experts find difficult. This gap calls for effective methods to enhance expert judgment.

Method: The study introduces LREAD, a rubric adapted from Korean writing standards, and uses a three-phase protocol: Phase 1 involves intuition-only detection, Phase 2 applies criterion scoring with justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates the method on unseen essays.

Result: Detection accuracy of the linguistics experts improved from 60% to 100% across the phases, along with a notable increase in inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa improved from -0.09 to 0.82).

Conclusion: The study highlights that rubric-based calibration significantly enhances expert detection of AI-generated Korean text, emphasizing that human judgment can complement automated systems in non-English language settings. The rubric and detection signatures were made publicly available.

Abstract: Distinguishing human-written Korean text from fluent LLM outputs remains difficult even for linguistically trained readers, who can over-trust surface well-formedness. We study whether expert detection can be treated as a learnable skill and improved through structured calibration. We introduce LREAD, a rubric derived from national Korean writing standards and adapted to target micro-level artifacts (e.g., punctuation optionality, spacing behavior, and register shifts). In a three-phase longitudinal blind protocol with Korean linguistics majors, Phase 1 measures intuition-only detection, Phase 2 enforces criterion-level scoring with explicit justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates domain-focused mastery on held-out elementary essays. Across phases, majority-vote accuracy increases from 60% to 100%, accompanied by stronger inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 --> 0.82). Compared to state-of-the-art LLM detectors, calibrated humans rely more on language-specific micro-diagnostics that are not well captured by coarse discourse priors. Our findings suggest that rubric-scaffolded expert judgment can serve as an interpretable complement to automated detectors for non-English settings, and we release the full rubric and a taxonomy of calibrated detection signatures.

### [46] [Simulating Complex Multi-Turn Tool Calling Interactions in Stateless Execution Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19914)
*Maxwell Crouse,Ibrahim Abdelaziz,Kshitij Fadnis,Siva Sankalp Patel,Kinjal Basu,Chulaka Gunasekara,Sadhana Kumaravel,Asim Munawar,Pavan Kapanipathi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called DiGiT-TC to generate synthetic multi-turn tool calling conversations for settings without a stateful execution environment, addressing gaps in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation techniques for multi-turn tool calling assume the presence of a stateful execution environment, which is not always available in real-world scenarios.

Method: The proposed method, DiGiT-TC, incorporates a novel generation pattern that implicitly represents certain tool calls to simulate the characteristics of stateful environments.

Result: DiGiT-TC shows strong performance gains on standard tool calling benchmarks, even in stateful problem settings.

Conclusion: DiGiT-TC can produce high-quality synthetic data for tool calling conversations without relying on a stateful execution environment, expanding applicability in situations like those prioritizing security or combining multi-source tool specifications.

Abstract: Synthetic data has proven itself to be a valuable resource for tuning smaller, cost-effective language models to handle the complexities of multi-turn tool calling conversations. While many frameworks and systems for producing synthetic multi-turn tool calling data have been proposed, prior works have frequently assumed that any tool calling interactions will take place in an execution environment that maintains state. When such an environment is available, this is advantageous as it allows for the validity of an interaction to be determined by whether or not the state of the execution environment matches to some prespecified objective. Unfortunately, this does not hold in many real-world tool use settings, e.g., in enterprise settings where data security is of the utmost importance or in cases where tool specifications are synthesized from multiple sources. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a data generation method, DiGiT-TC, that is designed to produce tool calling conversations that have the characteristics of conversations generated through search in a stateful environment. The key to our technique lies in a novel generation pattern that allows our approach to implicitly represent certain tool calls in the user request. We validate our approach on standard tool calling benchmarks and demonstrate that, even in stateful problem settings, our approach results in strong performance gains.

*Paul Tarau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Arrow Language Model, which uses intuitionistic logic and propositional structures for next-token prediction in neural architectures, compared to Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore logic-based alternatives to Transformer models with a focus on preserving token order through non-commutative sequencing in natural language model tasks.

Method: Develops a model based on intuitionistic-logic where token prediction is reimagined as a proof process and employs Prolog-based theorem provers to validate sequencing and structural decisions.

Result: Demonstrates the equivalence of the architecture to multiplicative RNNs, introduces a practical realization, and highlights its positioning as an alternative to Transformers and state-space models.

Conclusion: Logic-based neural architectures like Arrow offer new perspectives and structural advantages in token prediction through foundationally different theoretical underpinnings than widely-used Transformers.

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{Arrow Language Model}, a neural architecture derived from an intuitionistic-logic interpretation of next-token prediction. Instead of representing tokens as additive embeddings mixed by attention, we encode a prefix as a \emph{left-nested implication chain} whose structure preserves order through non-commutative composition. Next-token prediction corresponds to \emph{modus ponens}, and sequence processing becomes constructive proof extension under the Curry--Howard correspondence. Our Prolog-based specialized theorem provers validate fundamental properties of the neural models, among which relations between commutative vs. non-commutative sequencing and single-token vs. multi-token prediction choices. We show that a neural architecture equivalent to multiplicative RNNs arises naturally from a proof-theoretic interpretation of next-token prediction as nested intuitionistic implication, we present a practical low-rank neural realization and position the model relative to Transformers and state-space models.
  Keywords: logic-based derivation of neural architectures, intuitionistic implicational logic, token-as-operator neural models, state-space models, alternatives to transformer-based foundational models.

*Songjun Tu,Yiwen Ma,Jiahao Lin,Qichao Zhang,Xiangyuan Lan,Junfeng. Li,Nan Xu,Linjing Li,Dongbin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaperAudit-Bench, a framework designed to evaluate and enhance the critical rigor of large language models in automated peer reviews, emphasizing systematic error detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with providing critical and rigorous assessments in peer reviews, especially for subtle or cross-sectional issues.

Method: The authors developed PaperAudit-Bench, consisting of two components: PaperAudit-Dataset (an error dataset) and PaperAudit-Review (an automated review framework), which integrates error detection with evidence-aware review generation.

Result: Experiments using PaperAudit-Bench show variability in models' error detection capacity under long-context settings. The incorporation of explicit error detection yields stricter and more discriminative reviews compared to baseline models. Lightweight models trained on the dataset provide effective error detection with lower computational demands.

Conclusion: Integrating error detection into automated review systems enhances their critical rigor, making them more suitable for peer review tasks. The dataset also facilitates the development of efficient and cost-effective error detectors.

Abstract: Large language models can generate fluent peer reviews, yet their assessments often lack sufficient critical rigor when substantive issues are subtle and distributed across a paper. In this paper, we introduce PaperAudit-Bench, which consists of two components: (1) PaperAudit-Dataset, an error dataset covering both errors identifiable within individual sections and those requiring cross-section reasoning, designed for controlled evaluation under long-context settings; and (2) PaperAudit-Review, an automated review framework that integrates structured error detection with evidence-aware review generation to support critical assessment. Experiments on PaperAudit-Bench reveal large variability in error detectability across models and detection depths, highlighting the difficulty of identifying such errors under long-context settings. Relative to representative automated reviewing baselines, incorporating explicit error detection into the review workflow produces systematically stricter and more discriminative evaluations, demonstrating its suitability for peer review. Finally, we show that the dataset supports training lightweight LLM detectors via SFT and RL, enabling effective error detection at reduced computational cost.

### [49] [PILOT: Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19917)
*Haoyu Zheng,Yun Zhu,Yuqian Yuan,Bo Yuan,Wenqiao Zhang,Siliang Tang,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, PILOT, to enhance strategic reasoning in compact LLMs by internalizing guidance from larger models, improving accuracy significantly with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compact LLMs struggle with long-horizon reasoning tasks due to a lack of capacity to develop global strategies, leading to errors that accumulate over multi-step tasks.

Method: The authors propose PILOT, a framework that uses a Hyper-Network to generate Latent Guidance vectors, steering the model internally without modifying its backbone weights. This enables latent strategic reasoning without runtime dependence on external guidance.

Result: PILOT exhibits superior performance, improving reasoning accuracy (+8.9% on MATH500) across benchmarks like mathematics and coding, while maintaining negligible inference latency.

Conclusion: PILOT internalizes strategic reasoning capabilities into compact LLMs effectively, bridging the gap between performance and runtime practicality with impressive results on various reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Strategic planning is critical for multi-step reasoning, yet compact Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the capacity to formulate global strategies, leading to error propagation in long-horizon tasks. Our analysis reveals that LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked when conditioned on explicit plans from a teacher model; however, runtime reliance on external guidance is often impractical due to latency and availability constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose PILOT (Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories), a non-invasive framework designed to internalize the strategic oversight of large models into intrinsic Latent Guidance. Instead of altering backbone weights, PILOT employs a lightweight Hyper-Network to synthesize a query-conditioned Latent Guidance vector. This vector acts as an internal steering mechanism, guiding the model's representations toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on mathematical and coding benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT effectively stabilizes reasoning trajectories, consistently outperforming strong baselines (e.g., +8.9% on MATH500) with negligible inference latency.

### [50] [Lowest Span Confidence: A Zero-Shot Metric for Efficient and Black-Box Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19918)
*Yitong Qiao,Licheng Pan,Yu Mi,Lei Liu,Yue Shen,Fei Sun,Zhixuan Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lowest Span Confidence (LSC), a zero-shot metric for detecting hallucinations in Large Language Models using minimal resources, and demonstrates its superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder their reliable deployment, especially in high-stakes scenarios, and current detection methods require unrealistic resources such as intensive sampling or white-box model access.

Method: The proposed metric, LSC, uses a sliding window mechanism to evaluate the likelihood of semantically coherent spans based on single forward output probabilities, focusing on regions of lowest confidence to identify potential hallucinations.

Result: LSC achieves better hallucination detection performance than existing zero-shot baselines across various state-of-the-art LLMs and benchmarks, even under resource limitations.

Conclusion: LSC is an efficient and robust metric for detecting hallucinations in LLMs, addressing major drawbacks of previous methods, making it suitable for real-world API-based scenarios.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., the tendency to generate plausible but non-factual content, pose a significant challenge for their reliable deployment in high-stakes environments. However, existing hallucination detection methods generally operate under unrealistic assumptions, i.e., either requiring expensive intensive sampling strategies for consistency checks or white-box LLM states, which are unavailable or inefficient in common API-based scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel efficient zero-shot metric called Lowest Span Confidence (LSC) for hallucination detection under minimal resource assumptions, only requiring a single forward with output probabilities. Concretely, LSC evaluates the joint likelihood of semantically coherent spans via a sliding window mechanism. By identifying regions of lowest marginal confidence across variable-length n-grams, LSC could well capture local uncertainty patterns strongly correlated with factual inconsistency. Importantly, LSC can mitigate the dilution effect of perplexity and the noise sensitivity of minimum token probability, offering a more robust estimate of factual uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and diverse benchmarks show that LSC consistently outperforms existing zero-shot baselines, delivering strong detection performance even under resource-constrained conditions.

*Junseok Lee,Nahoon Kim,Sangyong Lee,Chang-Jae Chun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Self-Knowledge Distillation (ASKD) to address model shortcomings in knowledge distillation and proposes FastWhisper, a compact and efficient model variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods may transfer the limitations of the teacher model to the student, reducing the generalization ability of the student model.

Method: The study introduces ASKD to adaptively minimize reliance on the teacher model, enhancing self-training capabilities and performing self-knowledge distillation. They also distill the Whisper model into a faster and smaller alternative, FastWhisper.

Result: FastWhisper achieved a 1.07% lower word error rate compared to Whisper while running five times faster in inference.

Conclusion: ASKD effectively improves the generalization and training efficiency of student models, as demonstrated by the performance and speed gains of FastWhisper.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is one of the most effective methods for model compression. Previous studies have focused on the student model effectively training the predictive distribution of the teacher model. However, during training, the student model may inherit the shortcomings of the teacher model, which can lead to a decline in generalization capacity. To mitigate this issue, we propose adaptive self-knowledge distillation (ASKD), which dynamically reduces the dependence of the teacher model to improve the self-training capacity, and performs the self-knowledge distillation method to improve the generalization capacity of the student model. We further distill the Whisper model into a smaller variant, called FastWhisper. In our post-training setting, FastWhisper achieved a word error rate of 1.07% lower than the teacher model Whisper, and its relative inference time was 5 times faster.

*Xiaochen Zhu,Caiqi Zhang,Yizhou Chi,Tom Stafford,Nigel Collier,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper enhances multi-agent debates for large language models (MAD) by incorporating diversity in initial viewpoints and calibrated confidence communication, leading to improved performance over vanilla MAD and majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome the limitations of vanilla multi-agent debates, which often underperform despite their computational cost and fail to consistently yield correct outcomes.

Method: The authors introduce two interventions: diversity-aware initialization to ensure varied starting viewpoints and a confidence-modulated protocol for better alignment on the correct hypothesis.

Result: Results show consistent improvement of the proposed methods over vanilla MAD and majority votes across six reasoning-oriented benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed principled modifications offer substantial performance gains and demonstrate the relevance of human deliberation strategies to LLM-based debates.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is widely used to improve large language model (LLM) performance through test-time scaling, yet recent work shows that vanilla MAD often underperforms simple majority vote despite higher computational cost. Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence. We show theoretically that diversity-aware initialisation improves the prior probability of MAD success without changing the underlying update dynamics, while confidence-modulated updates enable debate to systematically drift to the correct hypothesis. Empirically, across six reasoning-oriented QA benchmarks, our methods consistently outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote. Our results connect human deliberation with LLM-based debate and demonstrate that simple, principled modifications can substantially enhance debate effectiveness.

*Laya Iyer,Kriti Aggarwal,Sanmi Koyejo,Gail Heyman,Desmond C. Ong,Subhabrata Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEART, a framework to compare human and LLM (large language model) abilities in emotional-support conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how LLM abilities in interpersonal communication compare to humans, while fostering progress in emotional support dialogues.

Method: The HEART framework evaluates human and LLM responses on multi-turn emotional-support conversations using blinded human raters and LLM-as-judge evaluators. This is based on a rubric across five interpersonal dimensions.

Result: Several LLMs approach or surpass humans in perceived empathy and consistency, but humans outperform in nuanced adaptive skills during challenging conversation scenarios.

Conclusion: HEART reveals distinct strength and gaps in LLMs compared to humans. It redefines supportive dialogue as an independent axis of capability and provides actionable insights into LLM affective conversational competence.

Abstract: Supportive conversation depends on skills that go beyond language fluency, including reading emotions, adjusting tone, and navigating moments of resistance, frustration, or distress. Despite rapid progress in language models, we still lack a clear way to understand how their abilities in these interpersonal domains compare to those of humans. We introduce HEART, the first-ever framework that directly compares humans and LLMs on the same multi-turn emotional-support conversations. For each dialogue history, we pair human and model responses and evaluate them through blinded human raters and an ensemble of LLM-as-judge evaluators. All assessments follow a rubric grounded in interpersonal communication science across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following. HEART uncovers striking behavioral patterns. Several frontier models approach or surpass the average human responses in perceived empathy and consistency. At the same time, humans maintain advantages in adaptive reframing, tension-naming, and nuanced tone shifts, particularly in adversarial turns. Human and LLM-as-judge preferences align on about 80 percent of pairwise comparisons, matching inter-human agreement, and their written rationales emphasize similar HEART dimensions. This pattern suggests an emerging convergence in the criteria used to assess supportive quality. By placing humans and models on equal footing, HEART reframes supportive dialogue as a distinct capability axis, separable from general reasoning or linguistic fluency. It provides a unified empirical foundation for understanding where model-generated support aligns with human social judgment, where it diverges, and how affective conversational competence scales with model size.

*Boxiang Zhao,Qince Li,Zhonghao Wang,Zelin Cao,Yi Wang,Peng Cheng,Bo Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Table-BiEval, a human-free evaluation framework to measure the structural fidelity of large language models (LLMs) when translating natural language into structured formats and analyzing tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective evaluation methodologies for assessing the structural fidelity of LLMs in code-like and tabular outputs without requiring costly human intervention.

Method: The authors propose a self-supervised framework, Table-BiEval, using deterministic Intermediate Representations to calculate Content Semantic Accuracy and Normalized Tree Edit Distance, assessing LLM performance across hierarchical and flat table structures.

Result: Testing on 15 state-of-the-art LLMs shows variability in performance, with some mid-sized models outperforming larger ones. The evaluation highlights that deep recursive nesting challenges all current architectures.

Conclusion: The framework effectively measures structural fidelity without human intervention and reveals key insights into LLM performance and limitations, particularly in handling complex nested structures.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, the capability to faithfully translate natural language into rigorous structured formats-essential for tool invocation-and to convert complex tabular information into machine-readable specifications has become paramount. However, current evaluations lack effective methodologies to measure this structural fidelity without costly human intervention, as traditional text metrics fail to detect semantic drift in code-like outputs. This paper proposes Table-BiEval, a novel approach based on a human-free, self-supervised evaluation framework, to assess LLMs performance quantitatively. By leveraging deterministic Intermediate Representations, our framework calculates Content Semantic Accuracy and Normalized Tree Edit Distance to decouple structure from content. Also, it empirically evaluates 15 state-of-the-art LLMs across dual topological dimensions-hierarchical structures and flat tables. The results reveal substantial variability, highlighting that mid-sized models can surprisingly outperform larger counterparts in structural efficiency and confirming that deep recursive nesting remains a universal bottleneck for current architectures.

TL;DR: This paper introduces OPT-ENGINE, a framework for evaluating LLMs on advanced optimization tasks, revealing critical bottlenecks and providing insights for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limits of LLMs in optimization modeling and addressing their weaknesses for solving real-world, complex problems.

Method: Development of OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark covering linear and mixed-integer programming tasks with scalable difficulty levels. Extensive studies on LLM reasoning capabilities were performed using varied setups.

Result: Key findings show that external solver integration enhances robustness against complexity, while pure-text reasoning faces limitations. Identified that automated constraint formulation is the major bottleneck.

Conclusion: OPT-ENGINE sheds light on LLMs' current limitations and highlights areas for improvement, guiding future research in advanced optimization with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in optimization modeling, fostering a rapid expansion of new methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. However, the boundaries of their capabilities in automated formulation and problem solving remain poorly understood, particularly when extending to complex, real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark framework designed to evaluate LLMs on optimization modeling with controllable and scalable difficulty levels. OPT-ENGINE spans 10 canonical tasks across operations research, with five Linear Programming and five Mixed-Integer Programming. Utilizing OPT-ENGINE, we conduct an extensive study of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing two critical questions: 1.) Do LLMs' performance remain robust when generalizing to out-of-distribution optimization tasks that scale in complexity beyond current benchmark levels? and 2.) At what stage, from problem interpretation to solution generation, do current LLMs encounter the most significant bottlenecks? Our empirical results yield two key insights: first, tool-integrated reasoning with external solvers exhibits significantly higher robustness as task complexity escalates, while pure-text reasoning reaches a ceiling; second, the automated formulation of constraints constitutes the primary performance bottleneck. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing next-generation LLMs for advanced optimization.

*Yinuo Liu,Emre Sezgin,Eric A. Youngstrom*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates the ability of LLMs in evaluating academic abstracts, comparing their reliability and agreement with human reviewers using a single grading rubric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in aiding scientific reviews by evaluating their consistency and reliability across different models and human reviewers.

Method: 160 abstracts were graded by three LLMs (ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5) and 14 human reviewers using a common rubric. Statistical metrics like ICCs and Bland-Altman plots were used to analyze agreement.

Result: LLMs showed good-to-excellent agreement among themselves and moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and objective criteria. Their reliability on subjective dimensions was weaker, indicating limitations in handling subjective judgments.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate potential in batch-processing abstracts and applying rubrics consistently but should complement human reviewers due to less reliability on subjective assessment dimensions.

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLMs) can process requests and generate texts, but their feasibility for assessing complex academic content needs further investigation. To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater. The weaker performance on subjective dimensions indicates that AI should serve a complementary role in evaluation, while human expertise remains essential.

TL;DR: A review of 337 articles assesses syntactic capabilities of Transformer-based models, noting strong results but limited focus on linguistic diversity and syntax-semantics interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and understand the syntactic abilities of Transformer-based language models and identify gaps in their evaluation and linguistic diversity.

Method: A systematic review of 337 articles analyzing 1,015 model results across various syntactic phenomena and interpretability methods.

Result: TLMs perform well for form-oriented phenomena but show weaker behavior for syntax-semantics interface aspects. The studies predominantly focus on English and BERT models.

Conclusion: Future work should expand linguistic diversity, align theoretical constructs, and focus on deeper syntactic challenges using broader empirical methods.

Abstract: We present a systematic review of 337 articles evaluating the syntactic abilities of Transformer-based language models, reporting on 1,015 model results from a range of syntactic phenomena and interpretability methods. Our analysis shows that the state of the art presents a healthy variety of methods and data, but an over-focus on a single language (English), a single model (BERT), and phenomena that are easy to get at (like part of speech and agreement). Results also suggest that TLMs capture these form-oriented phenomena well, but show more variable and weaker performance on phenomena at the syntax-semantics interface, like binding or filler-gap dependencies. We provide recommendations for future work, in particular reporting complete data, better aligning theoretical constructs and methods across studies, increasing the use of mechanistic methods, and broadening the empirical scope regarding languages and linguistic phenomena.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys attribution-based techniques in RAG systems to tackle hallucinations, providing a taxonomy, unified pipeline, and comparative analysis to guide future research and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question answering systems based on LLMs struggle with hallucinations that undermine response reliability, and while RAG frameworks aim to mitigate these issues, they introduce new challenges needing clear analysis and solutions.

Method: The paper creates a taxonomy of hallucination types, provides a unified pipeline for attribution, reviews related techniques, and analyzes strengths and weaknesses with practical recommendations.

Result: The survey provides a structured understanding of attribution-based techniques, clarifies RAG-induced hallucination issues, and identifies effective approaches to address them.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundation for systematically addressing hallucinations in RAG systems, fostering future advancements with actionable guidelines for deploying attribution-based solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based question answering (QA) systems play a critical role in modern AI, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, LLM-generated responses often suffer from hallucinations, unfaithful statements lacking reliable references. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks enhance LLM responses by incorporating external references but also introduce new forms of hallucination due to complex interactions between the retriever and generator. To address these challenges, researchers have explored attribution-based techniques that ensure responses are verifiably supported by retrieved content. Despite progress, a unified pipeline for these techniques, along with a clear taxonomy and systematic comparison of their strengths and weaknesses, remains lacking. A well-defined taxonomy is essential for identifying specific failure modes within RAG systems, while comparative analysis helps practitioners choose appropriate solutions based on hallucination types and application context. This survey investigates how attribution-based techniques are used within RAG systems to mitigate hallucinations and addresses the gap by: (i) outlining a taxonomy of hallucination types in RAG systems, (ii) presenting a unified pipeline for attribution techniques, (iii) reviewing techniques based on the hallucinations they target, and (iv) discussing strengths and weaknesses with practical guidelines. This work offers insights for future research and practical use of attribution techniques in RAG systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has catalyzed the emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that have pushed reasoning capabilities to new heights. While their performance has garnered significant excitement, exploring the internal mechanisms driving these behaviors has become an equally critical research frontier. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the mechanistic understanding of LRMs, organizing recent findings into three core dimensions: 1) training dynamics, 2) reasoning mechanisms, and 3) unintended behaviors. By synthesizing these insights, we aim to bridge the gap between black-box performance and mechanistic transparency. Finally, we discuss under-explored challenges to outline a roadmap for future mechanistic studies, including the need for applied interpretability, improved methodologies, and a unified theoretical framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Daisy, a cultural benchmark dataset for Danish heritage, based on the Danish Culture Canon 2006 with curated question-answer pairs from Wikipedia pages of cultural artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark dataset capturing Danish cultural heritage, ensuring a mix of mainstream and detailed information via curated and humanly validated questions.

Method: The approach involves querying Wikipedia for artifacts from the Danish Culture Canon 2006, generating questions using a language model, and humanly validating them to produce 741 question-answer pairs.

Result: The final dataset includes 741 human-approved question-answer pairs spanning diverse topics like archaeology, poetry, music, design, and architecture.

Abstract: We introduce a new benchmark for Danish culture via cultural heritage, Daisy, based on the curated topics from the Danish Culture Canon 2006. For each artifact in the culture canon, we query the corresponding Wikipedia page and have a language model generate random questions. This yields a sampling strategy within each work, with a mix of central of peripheral questions for each work, not only knowledge of mainstream information, but also in-depth cornerstones defining the heritage of Danish Culture, defined by the Canon committee. Each question-answer pair is humanly approved or corrected in the final dataset consisting of 741 close-ended question answer pairs covering topics, from 1300 BC. archaeological findings, 1700 century poems and musicals pieces to contemporary pop music and Danish design and architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid neuro-symbolic system combining neural network self-consistency voting and a symbolic ensemble to enhance narrative story similarity comparison accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of narrative story similarity detection, especially in cases of ambiguous comparisons.

Method: A hybrid system using a neural network with self-consistency voting, escalating uncertain cases, and a symbolic ensemble for final decisions based on multiple narrative similarity signals.

Result: The approach achieves an 81% accuracy on the development set, showcasing the effectiveness of deferring to symbolic methods for ambiguous cases.

Conclusion: Selective integration of symbolic methods with neural networks can improve predictions, highlighting the advantages of a hybrid neuro-symbolic system for narrative comparisons.

Abstract: We present a hybrid neuro-symbolic system for the SemEval-2026 Task 4 on Narrative Story Similarity. Our approach combines neural self-consistency voting with a novel Multi-Scale Narrative Analysis Ensemble that operates as a symbolic tiebreaker. The neural network component uses a large language model with multiple parallel votes, applying a supermajority threshold for confident decisions and escalating uncertain cases to additional voting rounds. When votes result in a perfect tie, a symbolic ensemble combining five narrative similarity signals (lexical overlap, semantic embeddings, story grammar structure, event chain alignment, and narrative tension curves) provides the final decision. Our cascade architecture achieves 81% accuracy on the development set, demonstrating that selective deferral to symbolic methods can enhance neural predictions on genuinely ambiguous narrative comparisons.

*Ruyuan Wan,Changye Li,Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores coded language in human communication and introduces the CodedLang dataset for NLP research, revealing challenges for language models in detecting and understanding coded expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limited ability of language models to handle coded language, caused by the lack of real-world datasets and clear classification frameworks.

Method: The researchers introduced the CodedLang dataset, a collection of 7,744 Chinese Google Maps reviews with 900 annotated for coded language. They developed a seven-class taxonomy to categorize encoding strategies and benchmarked language models on related tasks.

Result: The experiments showed major challenges for even strong language models in detecting and interpreting coded language expressions. Additionally, a phonetic analysis revealed challenges specific to pronunciation-based encoding strategies.

Conclusion: The paper underscores coded language as a critical and insufficiently studied issue, urging further research for improving the performance of NLP systems in this domain.

Abstract: Coded language is an important part of human communication. It refers to cases where users intentionally encode meaning so that the surface text differs from the intended meaning and must be decoded to be understood. Current language models handle coded language poorly. Progress has been limited by the lack of real-world datasets and clear taxonomies. This paper introduces CodedLang, a dataset of 7,744 Chinese Google Maps reviews, including 900 reviews with span-level annotations of coded language. We developed a seven-class taxonomy that captures common encoding strategies, including phonetic, orthographic, and cross-lingual substitutions. We benchmarked language models on coded language detection, classification, and review rating prediction. Results show that even strong models can fail to identify or understand coded language. Because many coded expressions rely on pronunciation-based strategies, we further conducted a phonetic analysis of coded and decoded forms. Together, our results highlight coded language as an important and underexplored challenge for real-world NLP systems.

*Kei Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel text-to-state mapping function for maintaining semantic ambiguity using the Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR) framework. It validates this concept empirically with impressive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity in linguistic inputs often collapses prematurely in computational models, resulting in loss of interpretative richness. This study seeks to maintain this ambiguity for more nuanced natural language processing.

Method: The paper develops the text-to-state mapping function using the NRR framework alongside a Contradiction-Preservation Principle. It uses Large Language Models for generating semantic interpretations and tests the approach empirically.

Result: Empirical testing on 68 linguistically ambiguous sentences shows the framework achieving mean Shannon entropy of 1.087 bits, preserving ambiguity effectively, compared to a baseline value of 0.000.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges natural language and NRR state spaces, providing a robust mechanism for preserving ambiguity and enhancing computational interpretation capabilities in language models.

Abstract: Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR) provides a formal framework for maintaining semantic ambiguity rather than forcing premature interpretation collapse. While the foundational architecture establishes state spaces and operators for ambiguity-preserving computation, the critical question of how natural language maps to these mathematical structures remains open. This paper introduces the text-to-state mapping function φ that transforms linguistic input into superposition states within the NRR framework. We formalize the Contradiction-Preservation Principle, which requires that genuinely ambiguous expressions maintain non-zero entropy in their state representations, and develop extraction protocols using existing Large Language Models as interpretation generators. Empirical validation across 68 test sentences spanning lexical, structural, and pragmatic ambiguity demonstrates that our mapping achieves mean Shannon entropy H(S) = 1.087 bits for ambiguous inputs while baseline single-interpretation approaches yield H(S) = 0.000. The framework provides the missing algorithmic bridge between raw text and the formal state spaces on which NRR operators act, enabling architectural collapse deferment in language model inference.

### [65] [Quantifying non deterministic drift in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19934)
*Claire Nicholson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates output variability (behavioral drift) in large language models (LLMs) when the same prompts are issued multiple times even with fixed parameters. Findings highlight persistent nondeterminism across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the baseline behavioral drift in LLMs that occurs even when identical prompts are used under controlled conditions.

Method: The study uses repeated-run experiments with two models (gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b) across five prompt types. They evaluate output variability using lexical similarity and word count statistics at temperatures 0.0 and 0.7.

Result: Nondeterminism is observed persistently, even at temperature 0.0, with variability influenced by model size, deployment type, and prompt categories.

Conclusion: The study establishes a baseline for understanding behavioral drift in LLMs and provides a foundation for developing future drift mitigation approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for tasks ranging from summarisation to decision support. In practice, identical prompts do not always produce identical outputs, even when temperature and other decoding parameters are fixed. In this work, we conduct repeated-run experiments to empirically quantify baseline behavioural drift, defined as output variability observed when the same prompt is issued multiple times under operator-free conditions. We evaluate two publicly accessible models, gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b, across five prompt categories using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures of 0.0 and 0.7. Drift is measured using unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics, enabling direct comparison across models, prompting modes, and deployment types. The results show that nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with distinct variability patterns by model size, deployment, and prompt type. We situate these findings within existing work on concept drift, behavioural drift, and infrastructure-induced nondeterminism, discuss the limitations of lexical metrics, and highlight emerging semantic approaches. By establishing a systematic empirical baseline in the absence of stabilisation techniques, this study provides a reference point for evaluating future drift mitigation and control methods.

### [66] [Mem2ActBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Long-Term Memory Utilization in Task-Oriented Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19935)
*Yiting Shen,Kun Li,Wei Zhou,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, Mem2ActBench, to evaluate LLM-based agents on their ability to actively leverage memory for executing complex tool-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on passive information retrieval rather than proactive memory application in real-world scenarios, highlighting the need for a tool-specific memory benchmark.

Method: The authors developed Mem2ActBench using automated data pipeline synthesis, resolving inconsistencies, and creating memory-dependent tool-use tasks for evaluation.

Result: The benchmark consists of 2,029 sessions and 400 tool-use tasks, with experiments showing current memory frameworks do not effectively utilize memory for task execution.

Conclusion: Improved techniques are necessary to enhance long-term memory application in LLM-based systems for better tool grounding and task execution.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed for complex, tool-based tasks where long-term memory is critical to driving actions. Existing benchmarks, however, primarily test a angent's ability to passively retrieve isolated facts in response to explicit questions. They fail to evaluate the more crucial capability of actively applying memory to execute tasks. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{Mem2ActBench}, a benchmark for evaluating whether agents can proactively leverage long-term memory to execute tool-based actions by selecting appropriate tools and grounding their parameters. The benchmark simulates persistent assistant usage, where users mention the same topic across long, interrupted interactions and expect previously established preferences and task states to be implicitly applied. We build the dataset with an automated pipeline that merges heterogeneous sources (ToolACE, BFCL, Oasst1), resolves conflicts via consistency modeling, and synthesizes 2,029 sessions with 12 user--assistant--tool turns on average. From these memory chains, a reverse-generation method produces 400 tool-use tasks, with human evaluation confirming 91.3\% are strongly memory-dependent. Experiments on seven memory frameworks show that current systems remain inadequate at actively utilizing memory for parameter grounding, highlighting the need for more effective approaches to evaluate and improve memory application in task execution.

*Thomas Schuster,Julius Trögele,Nico Döring,Robin Krüger,Matthieu Hoffmann,Holger Friedrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates 29 ASR models using a curated dataset of German doctor-patient conversations, focusing on medical and dialectal language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of evaluations for German medical ASR systems, emphasizing inclusion of dialects and regional linguistic variations.

Method: Researchers curated a dataset simulating German doctor-patient dialogues, then assessed 29 ASR models (open-source and commercial) using WER, CER, and BLEU metrics.

Result: The best models achieved Word Error Rates (WER) below 3%, but there were significant errors in handling medical terminology or dialects among less accurate models.

Conclusion: There is notable variability in performance, suggesting room for improvement, particularly concerning terminology and dialect comprehension.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) offers significant potential to reduce the workload of medical personnel, for example, through the automation of documentation tasks. While numerous benchmarks exist for the English language, specific evaluations for the German-speaking medical context are still lacking, particularly regarding the inclusion of dialects. In this article, we present a curated dataset of simulated doctor-patient conversations and evaluate a total of 29 different ASR models. The test field encompasses both open-weights models from the Whisper, Voxtral, and Wav2Vec2 families as well as commercial state-of-the-art APIs (AssemblyAI, Deepgram). For evaluation, we utilize three different metrics (WER, CER, BLEU) and provide an outlook on qualitative semantic analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance differences between the models: while the best systems already achieve very good Word Error Rates (WER) of partly below 3%, the error rates of other models, especially concerning medical terminology or dialect-influenced variations, are considerably higher.

*Michał Gromadzki,Anna Wróblewska,Agnieszka Kaliska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in detecting AI-generated text by developing and testing new detection models using large-scale human and AI-generated text corpora, achieving up to 99.6% token-level accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing difficulty in distinguishing AI-generated text from human writing, which has significant implications for education, publishing, and digital security.

Method: The study uses a 1-billion-token human text corpus and a 1.9-billion-token AI-generated text corpus to develop detection models. It introduces two novel training strategies: Per LLM and Per LLM family fine-tuning.

Result: The best fine-tuned detection model achieves a token-level accuracy of up to 99.6% across a benchmark including texts from 21 large language models.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve AI-generated text detection, offering tools that outperform existing open-source baselines and addressing a critical need in text authenticity verification.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models has enabled the generation of text that closely resembles human writing, creating challenges for authenticity verification in education, publishing, and digital security. Detecting AI-generated text has therefore become a crucial technical and ethical issue. This paper presents a comprehensive study of AI-generated text detection based on large-scale corpora and novel training strategies. We introduce a 1-billion-token corpus of human-authored texts spanning multiple genres and a 1.9-billion-token corpus of AI-generated texts produced by prompting a variety of LLMs across diverse domains. Using these resources, we develop and evaluate numerous detection models and propose two novel training paradigms: Per LLM and Per LLM family fine-tuning. Across a 100-million-token benchmark covering 21 large language models, our best fine-tuned detector achieves up to $99.6\%$ token-level accuracy, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines.

*J. Ben Tamo,Daniel Carlander-Reuterfelt,Jonathan Rubin,Dezhi Hong,Mingxian Wang,Oleg Poliannikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses language control issues in multilingual large language models (LLMs) by identifying two bottlenecks. It introduces efficient fine-tuning methods which successfully improve language consistency across tasks without sacrificing task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most large language models struggle with generating responses in the correct target language, even after multilingual pretraining, which hinders their usability in non-English tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a four-scenario evaluation protocol to identify language-specific issues in LLMs. It employs logit lens analysis for interpretability, tracks language probabilities, and measures cross-lingual similarity. Finally, it proposes selective fine-tuning of only the late layers responsible for language control.

Result: Selective fine-tuning achieves over 98% language consistency across six languages on Qwen-3-32B and Bloom-7.1B models, while fine-tuning only 3-5% of parameters, matching the performance of full-scope fine-tuning but with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: By localizing language control to specific layers within LLMs, the paper provides a novel approach for efficient multilingual adaptation, solving language consistency issues without degrading task performance.

Abstract: Despite multilingual pretraining, large language models often struggle with non-English tasks, particularly in language control, the ability to respond in the intended language. We identify and characterize two key failure modes: the multilingual transfer bottleneck (correct language, incorrect task response) and the language consistency bottleneck (correct task response, wrong language). To systematically surface these issues, we design a four-scenario evaluation protocol spanning MMLU, MGSM, and XQuAD benchmarks. To probe these issues with interpretability, we extend logit lens analysis to track language probabilities layer by layer and compute cross-lingual semantic similarity of hidden states. The results reveal a three-phase internal structure: early layers align inputs into a shared semantic space, middle layers perform task reasoning, and late layers drive language-specific generation. Guided by these insights, we introduce selective fine-tuning of only the final layers responsible for language control. On Qwen-3-32B and Bloom-7.1B, this method achieves over 98 percent language consistency across six languages while fine-tuning only 3-5 percent of parameters, without sacrificing task accuracy. Importantly, this result is nearly identical to that of full-scope fine-tuning (for example, above 98 percent language consistency for both methods across all prompt scenarios) but uses a fraction of the computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage layer-localization of language control for efficient multilingual adaptation.

*Pragatheeswaran Vipulanandan,Kamal Premaratne,Dilip Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an uncertainty quantification framework inspired by quantum physics to detect hallucinations in large language models, improving their reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models generate fluent text but struggle with hallucinations, producing unreliable outputs even under similar prompts, necessitating better detection and reliability methods.

Method: The authors use a quantum tensor network-based framework for uncertainty quantification, introducing entropy maximization to prioritize coherent outputs and identify unreliable model decisions.

Result: The framework consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines, showing robust results across 116 experiments, datasets (TriviaQA, NQ, SVAMP, SQuAD), and various LLM architectures.

Conclusion: This research offers an interpretable and practical tool for hallucination detection in LLMs, showing promise in resource-constrained settings and enabling better oversight through entropy identification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to confabulations, fluent yet unreliable outputs that vary arbitrarily even under identical prompts. Leveraging a quantum tensor network based pipeline, we propose a quantum physics inspired uncertainty quantification framework that accounts for aleatoric uncertainty in token sequence probability for semantic equivalence based clustering of LLM generations. This offers a principled and interpretable scheme for hallucination detection. We further introduce an entropy maximization strategy that prioritizes high certainty, semantically coherent outputs and highlights entropy regions where LLM decisions are likely to be unreliable, offering practical guidelines for when human oversight is warranted. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme under different generation lengths and quantization levels, dimensions overlooked in prior studies, demonstrating that our approach remains reliable even in resource constrained deployments. A total of 116 experiments on TriviaQA, NQ, SVAMP, and SQuAD across multiple architectures including Mistral-7B, Mistral-7B-instruct, Falcon-rw-1b, LLaMA-3.2-1b, LLaMA-2-13b-chat, LLaMA-2-7b-chat, LLaMA-2-13b, and LLaMA-2-7b show consistent improvements in AUROC and AURAC over state of the art baselines.

*Nishanth Sridhar Nakshatri,Eylon Caplan,Rajkumar Pujari,Dan Goldwasser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAIGR, a framework to analyze influencer discourse by understanding the pragmatic and argumentative structure of their recommendations instead of just factual claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health influencers often present information through narratives and rhetorical strategies, making it hard to validate content through conventional fact-checking methods.

Method: The TAIGR framework consists of identifying influencer recommendations (takeaway), building argumentation graphs for justifications, and performing probabilistic inference to validate the takeaway.

Result: TAIGR was evaluated on validating video transcripts from health influencers, demonstrating the necessity of analyzing discourse structure to accurately validate content.

Conclusion: Understanding the argumentative and pragmatic context of influencer content is essential for accurate content validation, as flat claim-based methods are insufficient.

Abstract: Health influencers play a growing role in shaping public beliefs, yet their content is often conveyed through conversational narratives and rhetorical strategies rather than explicit factual claims. As a result, claim-centric verification methods struggle to capture the pragmatic meaning of influencer discourse. In this paper, we propose TAIGR (Takeaway Argumentation Inference with Grounded References), a structured framework designed to analyze influencer discourse, which operates in three stages: (1) identifying the core influencer recommendation--takeaway; (2) constructing an argumentation graph that captures influencer justification for the takeaway; (3) performing factor graph-based probabilistic inference to validate the takeaway. We evaluate TAIGR on a content validation task over influencer video transcripts on health, showing that accurate validation requires modeling the discourse's pragmatic and argumentative structure rather than treating transcripts as flat collections of claims.

*Vikash Singh,Darion Cassel,Nathaniel Weir,Nick Feng,Sam Bayless*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neurosymbolic framework, VERGE, that combines Large Language Models with SMT solvers to improve logical consistency and correctness in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring logical correctness in Large Language Models is essential for high-stakes applications but remains a challenge.

Method: The approach combines LLM outputs decomposed into atomic claims, autoformalized into first-order logic, and verified through automated theorem proving, using innovations like consensus checking, semantic routing, and error localization.

Result: VERGE shows an average performance improvement of 18.7% at convergence across reasoning benchmarks compared to single-pass methods.

Conclusion: This hybrid neurosymbolic framework advances trustworthy AI by integrating formal guarantees with consensus-driven verification methods.

Abstract: Despite the syntactic fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their logical correctness in high-stakes domains remains a fundamental challenge. We present a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with SMT solvers to produce verification-guided answers through iterative refinement. Our approach decomposes LLM outputs into atomic claims, autoformalizes them into first-order logic, and verifies their logical consistency using automated theorem proving. We introduce three key innovations: (1) multi-model consensus via formal semantic equivalence checking to ensure logic-level alignment between candidates, eliminating the syntactic bias of surface-form metrics, (2) semantic routing that directs different claim types to appropriate verification strategies: symbolic solvers for logical claims and LLM ensembles for commonsense reasoning, and (3) precise logical error localization via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the exact subset of claims to revise, transforming binary failure signals into actionable feedback. Our framework classifies claims by their logical status and aggregates multiple verification signals into a unified score with variance-based penalty. The system iteratively refines answers using structured feedback until acceptance criteria are met or convergence is achieved. This hybrid approach delivers formal guarantees where possible and consensus verification elsewhere, advancing trustworthy AI. With the GPT-OSS-120B model, VERGE demonstrates an average performance uplift of 18.7% at convergence across a set of reasoning benchmarks compared to single-pass approaches.

### [73] [Counterfactual Cultural Cues Reduce Medical QA Accuracy in LLMs: Identifier vs Context Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20102)
*Amirhossein Haji Mohammad Rezaei,Zahra Shakeri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to test medical language models for cultural bias in diagnostic accuracy using expanded variants of MedQA test items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure medical language models diagnose correctly regardless of cultural context or non-decisive cultural information that may introduce bias.

Method: The researchers developed 1650 culturally tailored variants of MedQA test items, evaluated GPT-5.2, Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1, and MedGemma models under different prompts, and used a human-validated rubric for accuracy.

Result: Cultural cues significantly lowered model accuracy, particularly when identifier tokens and context co-occurred. Models frequently failed when reasoning relied on culturally specific information.

Conclusion: Medical language models must be further developed to avoid culturally induced diagnostic errors, and resources are provided to facilitate improvements.

Abstract: Engineering sustainable and equitable healthcare requires medical language models that do not change clinically correct diagnoses when presented with non-decisive cultural information. We introduce a counterfactual benchmark that expands 150 MedQA test items into 1650 variants by inserting culture-related (i) identifier tokens, (ii) contextual cues, or (iii) their combination for three groups (Indigenous Canadian, Middle-Eastern Muslim, Southeast Asian), plus a length-matched neutral control, where a clinician verified that the gold answer remains invariant in all variants. We evaluate GPT-5.2, Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1, and MedGemma (4B/27B) under option-only and brief-explanation prompting. Across models, cultural cues significantly affect accuracy (Cochran's Q, $p<10^-14$), with the largest degradation when identifier and context co-occur (up to 3-7 percentage points under option-only prompting), while neutral edits produce smaller, non-systematic changes. A human-validated rubric ($κ=0.76$) applied via an LLM-as-judge shows that more than half of culturally grounded explanations end in an incorrect answer, linking culture-referential reasoning to diagnostic failure. We release prompts and augmentations to support evaluation and mitigation of culturally induced diagnostic errors.

*Faezeh Hosseini,Mohammadali Yousefzadeh,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FFEHallu, the first benchmarking tool to evaluate figurative hallucination in large language models (LLMs), focusing on Persian idioms and proverbs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with fixed figurative expressions (FFEs) due to cultural grounding and non-compositionality, leading to challenges like figurative hallucination. There is a gap in benchmarking tools assessing this issue, especially for underrepresented languages like Persian.

Method: FFEHallu benchmarks LLM performance on Persian FFEs using 600 instances across three tasks: (1) FFE generation from meaning, (2) detection of fabricated FFEs, and (3) FFE to FFE translation from English to Persian.

Result: Tests on six multilingual LLMs reveal weaknesses: while GPT4.1 performs well in rejecting fabricated FFEs, most models fail to distinguish real idioms from fabricated ones and struggle with cross-lingual translation.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in handling figurative language, especially for underrepresented languages. Targeted benchmarks like FFEHallu are necessary to address figurative hallucination in LLMs.

Abstract: Figurative language, particularly fixed figurative expressions (FFEs) such as idioms and proverbs, poses persistent challenges for large language models (LLMs). Unlike literal phrases, FFEs are culturally grounded, largely non-compositional, and conventionally fixed, making them especially vulnerable to figurative hallucination. We define figurative hallucination as the generation or endorsement of expressions that sound idiomatic and plausible but do not exist as authentic figurative expressions in the target language. We introduce FFEHallu, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating figurative hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on Persian, a linguistically rich yet underrepresented language. FFEHallu consists of 600 carefully curated instances spanning three complementary tasks: (i) FFE generation from meaning, (ii) detection of fabricated FFEs across four controlled construction categories, and (iii) FFE to FFE translation from English to Persian. Evaluating six state of the art multilingual LLMs, we find systematic weaknesses in figurative competence and cultural grounding. While models such as GPT4.1 demonstrate relatively strong performance in rejecting fabricated FFEs and retrieving authentic ones, most models struggle to reliably distinguish real expressions from high quality fabrications and frequently hallucinate during cross lingual translation. These findings reveal substantial gaps in current LLMs handling of figurative language and underscore the need for targeted benchmarks to assess and mitigate figurative hallucination.

### [75] [Beyond Accuracy: A Cognitive Load Framework for Mapping the Capability Boundaries of Tool-use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20412)
*Qihao Wang,Yue Hu,Mingzhe Lu,Jiayue Wu,Yanbing Liu,Yuanmin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework grounded in Cognitive Load Theory to evaluate the tool-using capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing task complexity into intrinsic and extraneous cognitive loads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks focus on final accuracy, which obscures underlying bottlenecks and limits insight into models' true capability boundaries.

Method: The framework quantifies complexity into Intrinsic Load (structural problem complexity via Tool Interaction Graph) and Extraneous Load (ambiguity in task presentation). It further introduces ToolLoad-Bench for controlled experiments with adjustable cognitive load.

Result: The framework maps model performance boundaries and identifies distinct performance cliffs as cognitive load increases. Predictions made by the framework align well with empirical results.

Conclusion: This framework provides a principled methodology for diagnosing LLM limitations and a foundation for designing more efficient systems.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to use external tools unlocks powerful real-world interactions, making rigorous evaluation essential. However, current benchmarks primarily report final accuracy, revealing what models can do but obscuring the cognitive bottlenecks that define their true capability boundaries. To move from simple performance scoring to a diagnostic tool, we introduce a framework grounded in Cognitive Load Theory. Our framework deconstructs task complexity into two quantifiable components: Intrinsic Load, the inherent structural complexity of the solution path, formalized with a novel Tool Interaction Graph; and Extraneous Load, the difficulty arising from ambiguous task presentation. To enable controlled experiments, we construct ToolLoad-Bench, the first benchmark with parametrically adjustable cognitive load. Our evaluation reveals distinct performance cliffs as cognitive load increases, allowing us to precisely map each model's capability boundary. We validate that our framework's predictions are highly calibrated with empirical results, establishing a principled methodology for understanding an agent's limits and a practical foundation for building more efficient systems.

*Abha Jha,Akanksha Mahajan,Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Praveen Saravanan,Sai Sailaja Policharla,Sonal Chaturbhuj Gehlot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to encourage LLMs to abstain from answering when uncertain, reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often produce hallucinations that undermine their reliability; this study aims to address that issue by promoting intellectual humility through abstention.

Method: The authors fine-tune Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on specific benchmarks using RLVR with a ternary reward system and study the effects of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Moderate abstention rewards reduce incorrect responses without significant accuracy loss; larger models show higher robustness. Open-ended tasks face limitations, mitigated by supervised abstention training.

Conclusion: The study confirms RLVR as an effective method to reduce hallucinations in LLMs, demonstrating its practicality and flexibility in verifiable reward design for training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or unverifiable content, undermining their reliability in factual domains. This work investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a training paradigm that explicitly rewards abstention ("I don't know") alongside correctness to promote intellectual humility. We fine-tune and evaluate Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on the MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks using a ternary reward structure ($-1$, r_abs, 1) under varying abstention reward structures. We further study the effect of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning strategies that teach abstention prior to reinforcement learning. Our results show that moderate abstention rewards (r_abs $\approx -0.25$ to 0.3) consistently reduce incorrect responses without severe accuracy degradation on multiple-choice tasks, with larger models exhibiting greater robustness to abstention incentives. On open-ended question answering, we observe limitations due to insufficient exploration, which can be partially mitigated through supervised abstention training. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of verifiable reward design as a practical approach for hallucination mitigation in language models. Reproducible code for our abstention training framework is available here https://github.com/Mystic-Slice/rl-abstention.

### [77] [SERA: Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20789)
*Ethan Shen,Danny Tormoen,Saurabh Shah,Ali Farhadi,Tim Dettmers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SERA (Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents), a cost-effective method for training coding agents to specialize in private codebases using supervised finetuning. SERA achieves state-of-the-art performance among fully open-source models while significantly reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-weight coding agents fail to efficiently specialize in private codebases due to high costs and complexity. This paper seeks to make such specialization practical and accessible.

Method: The method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from single repositories or larger datasets; supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is then used for efficient agent specialization.

Result: SERA performs on par with leading models like Devstral-Small-2 while being 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the practicality of open-weight model specialization for private codebases, providing tools, data, and integration to support the research community.

Abstract: Open-weight coding agents should hold a fundamental advantage over closed-source systems: they can be specialized to private codebases, encoding repository-specific information directly in their weights. Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now practical. We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories. We use this dataset to provide detailed analysis of scaling laws, ablations, and confounding factors for training coding agents. Overall, we believe our work will greatly accelerate research on open coding agents and showcase the advantage of open-source models that can specialize to private codebases. We release SERA as the first model in Ai2's Open Coding Agents series, along with all our code, data, and Claude Code integration to support the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BengaliSent140, a large-scale Bengali sentiment dataset, addressing the lack of extensive annotated datasets for robust deep learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of large-scale and diverse annotated Bengali sentiment datasets required for training effective deep learning models.

Method: The authors consolidated seven existing Bengali datasets into a single dataset, standardized annotation schemes into binary sentiment classes (Not Hate and Hate), and ensured class balance for broader linguistic diversity.

Result: BengaliSent140 consists of 139,792 unique text samples with a balanced class distribution: 68,548 hate and 71,244 not-hate instances.

Conclusion: The BengaliSent140 dataset provides a foundational resource for training and benchmarking deep learning models in Bengali sentiment analysis, and its public availability facilitates further research.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for the Bengali language has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. However, progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale and diverse annotated datasets. Although several Bengali sentiment and hate speech datasets are publicly available, most are limited in size or confined to a single domain, such as social media comments. Consequently, these resources are often insufficient for training modern deep learning based models, which require large volumes of heterogeneous data to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we introduce BengaliSent140, a large-scale Bengali binary sentiment dataset constructed by consolidating seven existing Bengali text datasets into a unified corpus. To ensure consistency across sources, heterogeneous annotation schemes are systematically harmonized into a binary sentiment formulation with two classes: Not Hate (0) and Hate (1). The resulting dataset comprises 139,792 unique text samples, including 68,548 hate and 71,244 not-hate instances, yielding a relatively balanced class distribution. By integrating data from multiple sources and domains, BengaliSent140 offers broader linguistic and contextual coverage than existing Bengali sentiment datasets and provides a strong foundation for training and benchmarking deep learning models. Baseline experimental results are also reported to demonstrate the practical usability of the dataset. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akifislam/bengalisent140/

*Zilai Wang,Natarajan Balaji Shankar,Kaiyuan Zhang,Zihan Wang,Abeer Alwan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of delta SSL embeddings derived from contrast between pretrained and finetuned models to improve child ASR performance. It achieves significant WER reductions and sets a state-of-the-art standard on the MyST children's corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Child ASR performance struggles due to limited data and mismatch between pretraining and domain-specific data. The aim is to improve the representation quality for child speech tasks.

Method: The researchers propose calculating delta SSL embeddings (differences between embeddings from pretrained and finetuned models) and fusing these with embeddings from another SSL model for better task-specific information. Fusion strategies were evaluated on the MyST corpus using multiple SSL models.

Result: Delta embedding fusion reduces WER significantly; specific results show up to 10% WER reduction for HuBERT, 4.4% for W2V2, and a WER of 9.64 achieved through WavLM fusion with delta W2V2, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Delta embeddings from self-supervised models are effective for improving child ASR tasks. Feature fusion strategies leveraging these embeddings show promising results and set a new standard in child speech recognition.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have achieved impressive results across many speech tasks, yet child automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging due to limited data and pretraining domain mismatch. Fine-tuning SSL models on child speech induces shifts in the representation space. We hypothesize that delta SSL embeddings, defined as the differences between embeddings from a finetuned model and those from its pretrained counterpart, encode task-specific information that complements finetuned features from another SSL model. We evaluate multiple fusion strategies on the MyST childrens corpus using different models. Results show that delta embedding fusion with WavLM yields up to a 10 percent relative WER reduction for HuBERT and a 4.4 percent reduction for W2V2, compared to finetuned embedding fusion. Notably, fusing WavLM with delta W2V2 embeddings achieves a WER of 9.64, setting a new state of the art among SSL models on the MyST corpus. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of delta embeddings and highlight feature fusion as a promising direction for advancing child ASR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trajectory2Task, a pipeline to study tool-calling agents under ambiguous, changing, and infeasible user requests, showing consistent improvements through fine-tuning lightweight models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of training and evaluation data for tool-calling agents in real-world scenarios characterized by ambiguous, changing, and infeasible user requests.

Method: The method involves a data generation pipeline called Trajectory2Task, which explores tool-call trajectories and converts them into user-facing tasks with controlled variations for training and evaluation.

Result: The study benchmarks seven LLMs and observes failures in complex tasks, but fine-tuning lightweight LLMs with successful trajectories results in improved tool-calling performance and domain generalization.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning lightweight LLMs with verifiable data improves their ability to handle complex user scenarios and generalizes well to unseen domains, advancing practical tool-calling systems.

Abstract: Tool-calling agents are increasingly deployed in real-world customer-facing workflows. Yet most studies on tool-calling agents focus on idealized settings with general, fixed, and well-specified tasks. In real-world applications, user requests are often (1) ambiguous, (2) changing over time, or (3) infeasible due to policy constraints, and training and evaluation data that cover these diverse, complex interaction patterns remain under-represented. To bridge the gap, we present Trajectory2Task, a verifiable data generation pipeline for studying tool use at scale under three realistic user scenarios: ambiguous intent, changing intent, and infeasible intents. The pipeline first conducts multi-turn exploration to produce valid tool-call trajectories. It then converts these trajectories into user-facing tasks with controlled intent adaptations. This process yields verifiable task that support closed-loop evaluation and training. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art LLMs on the generated complex user scenario tasks and observe frequent failures. Finally, using successful trajectories obtained from task rollouts, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs and find consistent improvements across all three conditions, along with better generalization to unseen tool-use domains, indicating stronger general tool-calling ability.

*Shuoxin Wang,Chang Liu,Gowen Loo,Lifan Zheng,Kaiwen Wei,Xinyi Zeng,Jingyuan Zhang,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Me-Agent is a personalized mobile agent integrating user habit learning at both prompt and memory levels. It performs well in handling personalized instructions, ambiguous commands, and user-specific contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based mobile agents lack personalization, hindering their ability to handle ambiguous instructions, learn from interaction history, and process personalized tasks effectively.

Method: Me-Agent employs a two-level user habit learning approach: (1) User preference learning strategy with a Personal Reward Model at the prompt level and (2) Hierarchical Preference Memory for storing long-term and app-specific user data at the memory level.

Result: Experiments on the new User FingerTip benchmark and general benchmarks demonstrate Me-Agent's advanced personalization capabilities alongside competitive instruction execution performance.

Conclusion: Me-Agent offers robust solutions for personalized mobile agent applications, overcoming the limitations of traditional LLM-based agents in handling personalized contexts and preferences.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based mobile agents have made significant performance advancements. However, these agents often follow explicit user instructions while overlooking personalized needs, leading to significant limitations for real users, particularly without personalized context: (1) inability to interpret ambiguous instructions, (2) lack of learning from user interaction history, and (3) failure to handle personalized instructions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose Me-Agent, a learnable and memorable personalized mobile agent. Specifically, Me-Agent incorporates a two-level user habit learning approach. At the prompt level, we design a user preference learning strategy enhanced with a Personal Reward Model to improve personalization performance. At the memory level, we design a Hierarchical Preference Memory, which stores users' long-term memory and app-specific memory in different level memory. To validate the personalization capabilities of mobile agents, we introduce User FingerTip, a new benchmark featuring numerous ambiguous instructions for daily life. Extensive experiments on User FingerTip and general benchmarks demonstrate that Me-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance in personalization while maintaining competitive instruction execution performance.

*Husein Zolkepli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes modifications to X-Codec-2.0 to improve efficiency and audio quality by halving the latent rate and increasing the sampling rate. Results show a significant gain in perceptual quality over the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the temporal efficiency and audio fidelity of X-Codec-2.0 while maintaining its core architecture and strong performance.

Method: The authors introduced additional pooling and increased the decoder hop size, reducing the latent rate to 25 Hz and increasing the output sampling rate to 24 kHz.

Result: The modified version achieved a 0.29 MOS improvement based on UTMOSv2 and demonstrated leading performance among codecs operating at a 25 Hz latent rate.

Conclusion: The changes improved perceptual quality and efficiency without altering X-Codec-2.0's architecture, establishing the approach as highly effective in both audio compression and multilingual speech modeling.

Abstract: X-Codec-2.0 has shown strong performance in neural audio compression and multilingual speech modeling, operating at a 50 Hz latent rate and a 16 kHz sampling rate using frozen HuBERT features. While effective, this configuration limits temporal efficiency and audio fidelity. In this work, we explore a simple and effective modification by introducing additional pooling and increasing the decoder hop size. This reduces the latent rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz and simultaneously raises the output sampling rate from 16 kHz to 24 kHz, improving efficiency and perceptual quality without altering the core architecture. Evaluated on the multilingual Common Voice 17 test set, the proposed configuration achieves a 0.29 MOS improvement over the original X-Codec-2.0 baseline based on UTMOSv2, and attains the best reported performance among all codecs operating at 25 Hz. The source code, checkpoints, and generation comparisons are released at \href{https://huggingface.co/Scicom-intl/xcodec2-25TPS-24k}{https://huggingface.co/Scicom-intl/xcodec2-25TPS-24k}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance full-duplex voice interaction that enables natural, uninterrupted human-computer communication.

Method: The framework decomposes dialogue into minimal conversational units for independent processing and prediction, utilizing a multimodal large language model supported by auxiliary modules like voice activity detection and text-to-speech synthesis.

Result: The system performs effectively as confirmed by experiments on the HumDial dataset, achieving second place in the Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (Full-Duplex Interaction track).

Conclusion: This plug-and-play, train-free dialogue framework enhances full-duplex systems and shows promise for widespread usability.

Abstract: Full-duplex voice interaction is crucial for natural human computer interaction. We present a framework that decomposes complex dialogue into minimal conversational units, enabling the system to process each unit independently and predict when to transit to the next. This framework is instantiated as a semi-cascaded full-duplex dialogue system built around a multimodal large language model, supported by auxiliary modules such as voice activity detection (VAD) and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. The resulting system operates in a train-free, plug-and-play manner. Experiments on the HumDial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, which ranks second among all teams on the test set of the Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (Track 2: Full-Duplex Interaction).

*Si Chen,Le Huy Khiem,Annalisa Szymanski,Ronald Metoyer,Ting Hua,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for automating benchmark generation in contextual reasoning, particularly for professional domains like teaching and caregiving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in evaluating contextual reasoning in domains with procedural and practice-based knowledge where traditional datasets are scarce.

Method: Leverages expert guidelines and Bloom’s Taxonomy to create scalable benchmarks, producing auto-graded MCQs and dialogues across four cognitive levels.

Result: Analyzed models in teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, revealing non-intuitive reasoning behaviors among LLMs.

Conclusion: Introduced scalable, psychometrically-informed benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in contextual reasoning, highlighting both strengths and shortcomings.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) evaluates a model's ability to perform contextualized reasoning beyond factual recall. This challenge is especially acute in practice-based domains, where knowledge is procedural and grounded in professional judgment, while most existing LLM benchmarks depend on pre-existing human exam datasets that are often unavailable in such settings. We introduce a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert-authored guidelines informed by Bloom's Taxonomy. It converts expert practices into implicit violation-based scenarios and expands them into auto-graded multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and multi-turn dialogues across four cognitive levels, enabling deterministic, reproducible, and scalable evaluation. Applied to three applied domains: teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, we find differences between model and human-like reasoning: LLMs sometimes perform relatively better on higher-order reasoning (Analyze) but fail more frequently on lower-level items (Remember). We produce large-scale, psychometrically informed benchmarks that surface these non-intuitive model behaviors and enable evaluation of contextualized reasoning in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Online hate speech spans from overt slurs to subtle reasoning-based language that current moderation systems struggle to detect. A novel benchmark, SoftHateBench, is introduced to simulate and analyze these subtler forms of hate speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moderation systems focus on overt, surface-level toxicity but fail to recognize subtle reasoning-driven hostility in online hate speech.

Method: SoftHateBench uses the Argumentum Model of Topics (AMT) and Relevance Theory (RT) to generate coherent soft hate variants by rephrasing explicit hostile standpoints into seemingly neutral discourse.

Result: Produced a generative benchmark containing 4,745 soft-hate instances across 7 sociocultural domains and 28 target groups. Evaluation shows moderation systems consistently miss subtle hate speech despite detecting obvious hostility.

Conclusion: Online moderation efforts need systematic tools like SoftHateBench to address reasoning-driven subtleties in hate speech effectively.

Abstract: Online hate on social media ranges from overt slurs and threats (\emph{hard hate speech}) to \emph{soft hate speech}: discourse that appears reasonable on the surface but uses framing and value-based arguments to steer audiences toward blaming or excluding a target group. We hypothesize that current moderation systems, largely optimized for surface toxicity cues, are not robust to this reasoning-driven hostility, yet existing benchmarks do not measure this gap systematically. We introduce \textbf{\textsc{SoftHateBench}}, a generative benchmark that produces soft-hate variants while preserving the underlying hostile standpoint. To generate soft hate, we integrate the \emph{Argumentum Model of Topics} (AMT) and \emph{Relevance Theory} (RT) in a unified framework: AMT provides the backbone argument structure for rewriting an explicit hateful standpoint into a seemingly neutral discussion while preserving the stance, and RT guides generation to keep the AMT chain logically coherent. The benchmark spans \textbf{7} sociocultural domains and \textbf{28} target groups, comprising \textbf{4,745} soft-hate instances. Evaluations across encoder-based detectors, general-purpose LLMs, and safety models show a consistent drop from hard to soft tiers: systems that detect explicit hostility often fail when the same stance is conveyed through subtle, reasoning-based language. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer.} Contains offensive examples used solely for research.}

TL;DR: This paper discusses the adaptation of the LIWC methodology for analyzing texts in Russian, considering its grammatical and cultural uniqueness, and introduces a web service called RusLICA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a psycholinguistic text analysis tool for the Russian language since most existing tools like LIWC are originally designed for English, and to address the specific grammatical and cultural needs of Russian.

Method: A Russian-specific dictionary was developed using lexicographic resources, semantic dictionaries, and corpora. The methodology involves 96 linguistic categories, integrating various linguistic and statistical features, and applying pre-trained language models for analysis.

Result: The study mapped lemmas to 42 psycholinguistic categories and successfully implemented the methodology within the RusLICA web service.

Conclusion: The proposed tool expands the LIWC methodology for Russian language analysis and provides a functional resource for psycholinguistic studies tailored to the specificity of Russian languages.

Abstract: Defining psycholinguistic characteristics in written texts is a task gaining increasing attention from researchers. One of the most widely used tools in the current field is Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) that originally was developed to analyze English texts and translated into multiple languages. Our approach offers the adaptation of LIWC methodology for the Russian language, considering its grammatical and cultural specificities. The suggested approach comprises 96 categories, integrating syntactic, morphological, lexical, general statistical features, and results of predictions obtained using pre-trained language models (LMs) for text analysis. Rather than applying direct translation to existing thesauri, we built the dictionary specifically for the Russian language based on the content from several lexicographic resources, semantic dictionaries and corpora. The paper describes the process of mapping lemmas to 42 psycholinguistic categories and the implementation of the analyzer as part of RusLICA web service.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial benchmark for evaluating long-context large language models' (LLMs) evidence retrieval and usage, highlighting challenges with semantic interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluations, which mostly focus on span localization in benign settings and fail to test long-context systems under realistic and adversarial conditions.

Method: The authors developed EMB-S, a benchmark paired with a 326M-token MemoryBank and designed adversarial tests with human-validated gold evidence sets and hard negatives. They also introduced a diagnostic protocol separating evidence access from end-to-end QA performance.

Result: Findings reveal that systems performing well in benign NIAH settings degrade significantly when challenged with semantic interference, showing that semantic discrimination is a bigger bottleneck than context length in long-context memory systems.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to address semantic discrimination challenges to improve LLM evidence access and performance in large-scale, long-context scenarios, moving beyond reliance on higher context lengths alone.

Abstract: Long-context LLM agents must access the right evidence from large environments and use it faithfully. However, the popular Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation mostly measures benign span localization. The needle is near-unique, and the haystack is largely irrelevant. We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap. Systems that saturate benign NIAH degrade sharply in evidence access under semantic interference. These results indicate that semantic discrimination, not context length alone, is the dominant bottleneck for long-context memory at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents MiLorE-SSL, a framework aimed at efficient continual multilingual training for speech representation learning using strategies like LoRA and soft mixture-of-experts (MoE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently expand multilingual self-supervised learning (SSL) models with new languages without costly retraining or catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The MiLorE-SSL framework combines LoRA for low-rank adaptation and soft Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for flexible expert sharing. Additionally, limited replay data prevents forgetting.

Result: Experiments on ML-SUPERB show that MiLorE-SSL performs well on new languages while enhancing existing ones, requiring only 2.14% trainable parameters.

Conclusion: MiLorE-SSL provides an efficient solution for continual multilingual SSL training, effectively managing cross-lingual interference and catastrophic forgetting with minimal computational resources.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has greatly advanced speech representation learning, but multilingual SSL models remain constrained to languages encountered during pretraining. Retraining from scratch to incorporate new languages is computationally expensive, while sequential training without migitation strategies often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose MiLorE-SSL, a lightweight framework that combines LoRA modules with a soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism for efficient continual multilingual training. LoRA provides efficient low-rank adaptation, while soft MoE promotes flexible expert sharing across languages, reducing cross-lingual interference. To further mitigate forgetting, we introduce limited replay data from existing languages, avoiding reliance on large historical corpora. Experiments on ML-SUPERB demonstrate that MiLorE-SSL achieves strong performance in new languages and improves the ability in existing ones with only 2.14% trainable parameters.

*Kaiyuan Chen,Guangmin Zheng,Jin Wang,Xiaobing Zhou,Xuejie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Process Optimization (SAPO) to improve Small Language Models (SLMs) by addressing the reasoner-verifier gap in reasoning tasks more efficiently than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the reasoner-verifier gap in self-evolution methods of SLMs, particularly in fine-grained reasoning tasks, while overcoming the inefficiency of Monte Carlo (MC) process supervision.

Method: The authors introduce SAPO, a method which localizes errors and minimizes the reasoner-verifier gap adaptively, inspired by Error-Related Negativity (ERN), eliminating reliance on computationally expensive MC estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAPO's superiority over most existing self-evolution methods in tasks involving mathematics and coding, and new benchmarks are introduced to analyze its effect on verifier performance.

Conclusion: SAPO is a significant improvement for SLM self-evolution by addressing reasoning inefficiencies, demonstrating robust results in complex mathematical and coding challenges, with further potential explored through new task benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing self-evolution methods overlook the influence of fine-grained reasoning steps, which leads to the reasoner-verifier gap. The computational inefficiency of Monte Carlo (MC) process supervision further exacerbates the difficulty in mitigating the gap. Motivated by the Error-Related Negativity (ERN), which the reasoner can localize error following incorrect decisions, guiding rapid adjustments, we propose a Self-Adaptive Process Optimization (SAPO) method for self-improvement in Small Language Models (SLMs). SAPO adaptively and efficiently introduces process supervision signals by actively minimizing the reasoner-verifier gap rather than relying on inefficient MC estimations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms most existing self-evolution methods on two challenging task types: mathematics and code. Additionally, to further investigate SAPO's impact on verifier performance, this work introduces two new benchmarks for process reward models in both mathematical and coding tasks.

### [90] [Beyond Speedup -- Utilizing KV Cache for Sampling and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20326)
*Zeyu Xing,Xing Li,Hui-Ling Zhen,Mingxuan Yuan,Sinno Jialin Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores utilizing KV caches not just for speeding up autoregressive decoding but as free contextual representations for downstream tasks, achieving competitive performance in key applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caches are typically underutilized or limited to speeding up decoding processes in LLMs. The authors aim to explore whether these lightly encoded representations could serve broader purposes in downstream tasks effectively.

Method: The authors use KV-derived representations for two applications: (1) Chain-of-Embedding to enhance embedding representation capabilities, tested on advanced LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2-7B, and (2) Fast/Slow Thinking Switching to enable adaptive reasoning, reducing token generations while maintaining accuracy.

Result: The KV-derived representations perform competitively or even better in embedding tasks (e.g., Chain-of-Embedding) and significantly enhance efficiency in reasoning tasks, reducing token generation times by up to 5.7x with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: KV caches are shown to be effective as a free and reusable substrate for downstream tasks, extending their utility beyond traditional autoregressive decoding and paving new pathways for efficient representation reuse in LLM inference tasks.

Abstract: KV caches, typically used only to speed up autoregressive decoding, encode contextual information that can be reused for downstream tasks at no extra cost. We propose treating the KV cache as a lightweight representation, eliminating the need to recompute or store full hidden states. Despite being weaker than dedicated embeddings, KV-derived representations are shown to be sufficient for two key applications: \textbf{(i) Chain-of-Embedding}, where they achieve competitive or superior performance on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct; and \textbf{(ii) Fast/Slow Thinking Switching}, where they enable adaptive reasoning on Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distil-Qwen-14B, reducing token generation by up to $5.7\times$ with minimal accuracy loss. Our findings establish KV caches as a free, effective substrate for sampling and reasoning, opening new directions for representation reuse in LLM inference.

*Xinyu Hu,Yancheng He,Weixun Wang,Tao Feng,Li Lin,Jiashun Liu,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in automatic evaluation of open-ended natural language generation, proposing a novel reward model that outperforms prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current generative evaluation methods, including over-reliance on pairwise evaluation and inadequate optimization, and improve their effectiveness in reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors propose CE-RM-4B, a pointwise generative reward model trained through a two-stage rollout method and unified query-based criteria, utilizing a curated dataset of 5.7K high-quality samples.

Result: CE-RM-4B demonstrates superior performance on generative reward model benchmarks and downstream RL tasks, particularly excelling in Best-of-N evaluations.

Conclusion: The CE-RM-4B model offers a more effective and flexible evaluation framework, improving both benchmark performance and reinforcement learning outcomes.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation is crucial yet challenging for open-ended natural language generation, especially when rule-based metrics are infeasible. Compared with traditional methods, the recent LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms enable better and more flexible evaluation, and show promise as generative reward models for reinforcement learning. However, prior work has revealed a notable gap between their seemingly impressive benchmark performance and actual effectiveness in RL practice. We attribute this issue to some limitations in existing studies, including the dominance of pairwise evaluation and inadequate optimization of evaluation criteria. Therefore, we propose CE-RM-4B, a pointwise generative reward model trained with a dedicated two-stage rollout method, and adopting unified query-based criteria. Using only about 5.7K high-quality data curated from the open-source preference dataset, our CE-RM-4B achieves superior performance on diverse reward model benchmarks, especially in Best-of-N scenarios, and delivers more effective improvements in downstream RL practice.

*Zhuang Chen,Dazhen Wan,Zhangkai Zheng,Guanqun Bi,Xiyao Xiao,Binghang Li,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework named Ps to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in mental healthcare by addressing evaluation instability and leveraging tournaments for reliable assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unstructured and evolving nature of counseling makes it hard to evaluate the therapeutic capability of LLMs. Current evaluation methods lack stable judgments due to 'process drift' and 'standard drift.'

Method: The proposed Ps framework uses simulation to anchor trajectory interactions and a Swiss-system tournament for pairwise battles, generating Elo ratings to assess LLM competence. Additionally, tournament findings serve as reward signals for reinforcement learning to improve LLMs.

Result: Ps effectively provides consistent assessments that align with expert judgments, and it opens pathways for enhancing LLM performance through on-policy learning.

Conclusion: The Ps framework successfully addresses evaluation challenges in therapy-oriented LLMs and offers a robust approach for improving their capabilities.

Abstract: While large language models show promise in mental healthcare, evaluating their therapeutic competence remains challenging due to the unstructured and longitudinal nature of counseling. We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MobileBench-OL, an online benchmark designed to evaluate mobile GUI agents across task execution, complex reasoning, and robustness to real-world noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack assessment for reasoning and exploration abilities, and ignore real-world noise, creating gaps in evaluating GUI agents realistically.

Method: Developed MobileBench-OL with 1080 tasks from 80 apps, structured into 5 subsets addressing multiple evaluation dimensions, including task complexity and noise. Includes an auto-eval framework for repeatable results.

Result: Testing 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL highlighted substantial deficiencies in meeting real-world requirements. Human evaluation validated its reliability.

Conclusion: MobileBench-OL offers a comprehensive and realistic benchmark, improving evaluation accuracy for GUI agents. Data and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Recent advances in mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents highlight the growing need for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. While new online benchmarks offer more realistic testing than offline ones, they tend to focus on the agents' task instruction-following ability while neglecting their reasoning and exploration ability. Moreover, these benchmarks do not consider the random noise in real-world mobile environments. This leads to a gap between benchmarks and real-world environments. To addressing these limitations, we propose MobileBench-OL, an online benchmark with 1080 tasks from 80 Chinese apps. It measures task execution, complex reasoning, and noise robustness of agents by including 5 subsets, which set multiple evaluation dimensions. We also provide an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism, enabling stable and repeatable real-world benchmarking. Evaluating 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL shows significant room for improvement to meet real-world requirements. Human evaluation further confirms that MobileBench-OL can reliably measure the performance of leading GUI agents in real environments. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.

*Yangyi Shen,Tianjian Feng,Jiaqi Han,Wen Wang,Tianlang Chen,Chunhua Shen,Jure Leskovec,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Order-Token Search to improve Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) by enabling joint search across generation order and token values, showing significant performance improvement in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs face limitations in decoding due to their single trajectory commitment, restricting exploration of possible generation trajectories.

Method: The authors introduce Order-Token Search, which applies a likelihood estimator for scoring denoising actions, facilitating efficient exploration and pruning in trajectory space.

Result: Order-Token Search outperforms existing methods significantly on benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH500, Countdown, and HumanEval, achieving up to a 7.9% improvement.

Conclusion: Joint search in decoding processes is crucial for advancing DLMs, as demonstrated by Order-Token Search's superior performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer order-agnostic generation that can explore many possible decoding trajectories. However, current decoding methods commit to a single trajectory, limiting exploration in trajectory space. We introduce Order-Token Search to explore this space through jointly searching over generation order and token values. Its core is a likelihood estimator that scores denoising actions, enabling stable pruning and efficient exploration of diverse trajectories. Across mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks, Order-Token Search consistently outperforms baselines on GSM8K, MATH500, Countdown, and HumanEval (3.1%, 3.8%, 7.9%, and 6.8% absolute over backbone), matching or surpassing diffu-GRPO post-trained d1-LLaDA. Our work establishes joint search as a key component for advancing decoding in DLMs.

TL;DR: SpeechMapper introduces a cost-effective approach for linking speech models to LLMs, reducing overfitting and training loads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiency and overfitting in current speech-LLM integration methods.

Method: Pretraining the speech model separately from the LLM on less expensive hardware, followed by a short instruction tuning step for LLM integration.

Result: SpeechMapper performs competitively in task-agnostic applications and excels in task-specific scenarios while using fewer resources.

Conclusion: SpeechMapper provides an efficient, scalable, and generalizable solution for speech-to-LLM tasks, reducing reliance on intensive training data and compute.

Abstract: Current speech LLMs bridge speech foundation models to LLMs using projection layers, training all of these components on speech instruction data. This strategy is computationally intensive and susceptible to task and prompt overfitting. We present SpeechMapper, a cost-efficient speech-to-LLM-embedding training approach that mitigates overfitting, enabling more robust and generalizable models. Our model is first pretrained without the LLM on inexpensive hardware, and then efficiently attached to the target LLM via a brief 1K-step instruction tuning (IT) stage. Through experiments on speech translation and spoken question answering, we demonstrate the versatility of SpeechMapper's pretrained block, presenting results for both task-agnostic IT, an ASR-based adaptation strategy that does not train in the target task, and task-specific IT. In task-agnostic settings, Speechmapper rivals the best instruction-following speech LLM from IWSLT25, despite never being trained on these tasks, while in task-specific settings, it outperforms this model across many datasets, despite requiring less data and compute. Overall, SpeechMapper offers a practical and scalable approach for efficient, generalizable speech-LLM integration without large-scale IT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes emotion expression across topics in Finnish parliamentary speeches from 2000 to 2020, revealing topic-specific patterns and trends in positivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on topic-specific patterns of emotion expression in parliamentary debates, particularly within the Finnish parliament.

Method: Employs an emotion analysis model to study emotion expression by topic in Finnish parliamentary speeches from synchronic (time-specific) and diachronic (over time) perspectives.

Result: Findings indicate an increasing trend of positivity in parliamentary speech and reveal varying emotion expressions tied to different topics.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into how emotions are expressed in parliamentary debates, emphasizing that topic-specific patterns exist and positivity is on the rise in speeches over time.

Abstract: Existing research often treats parliamentary discourse as a homogeneous whole, overlooking topic-specific patterns. Parliamentary speeches address a wide range of topics, some of which evoke stronger emotions than others. While everyone has intuitive assumptions about what the most emotive topics in a parliament may be, there has been little research into the emotions typically linked to different topics. This paper strives to fill this gap by examining emotion expression among the topics of parliamentary speeches delivered in Eduskunta, the Finnish Parliament, between 2000 and 2020. An emotion analysis model is used to investigate emotion expression in topics, from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. The results strengthen evidence of increasing positivity in parliamentary speech and provide further insights into topic-specific emotion expression within parliamentary debate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in complex tool usage by LLMs, including weak planning, tool hallucination, and errors in parameter generation.

Method: PEARL employs a two-stage framework: offline exploration for valid tool usage learning, and an online reinforcement learning phase using GRPO with tailored rewards.

Result: PEARL outperforms previous methods, achieving a 56.5% success rate on the ToolHop benchmark and reduced invocation errors.

Conclusion: PEARL's approach signifies progress in enhancing LLM capability for robust tool use, establishing stronger theoretical and practical foundations for future work.

Abstract: Large Language Models show great potential with external tools, but face significant challenges in complex, multi-turn tool invocation. They often exhibit weak planning, tool hallucination, erroneous parameter generation, and struggle with robust interaction. To tackle these issues, we present PEARL, a novel framework to enhance LLM planning and execution for sophisticated tool use. PEARL adopts a two-stage approach: an offline phase where the agent explores tools to learn valid usage patterns and failure conditions, and an online reinforcement learning phase. In the online phase, a dedicated Planner is trained via group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a carefully designed reward function that provides distinct signals for planning quality. Experiments on the ToolHop and T-Eval benchmarks show PEARL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art success rate of \textbf{56.5\%} on ToolHop while maintaining a low invocation error rate. Our work marks a key advance in addressing the complex planning challenges of tool use, contributing to the development of more robust and reliable LLM-based agents.

*Diandian Guo,Fangfang Yuan,Cong Cao,Xixun Lin,Chuan Zhou,Hao Peng,Yanan Cao,Yanbing Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses sarcasm analysis in multimodal dialogues, proposing a unified framework (MuVaC) for detection and explanation tasks using causal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in understanding sarcasm in multimodal social dialogues, emphasizing the causal relationship between detection and explanation.

Method: It introduces MuVaC, a framework leveraging variational causal models and a multimodal alignment-fusion strategy for joint optimization of sarcasm detection and explanation.

Result: Experimental findings show MuVaC's improved performance on public datasets compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: MuVaC offers a novel perspective on multimodal sarcasm analysis by integrating detection and explanation tasks through causal inference for enhanced reasoning trustworthiness.

Abstract: The prevalence of sarcasm in multimodal dialogues on the social platforms presents a crucial yet challenging task for understanding the true intent behind online content. Comprehensive sarcasm analysis requires two key aspects: Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD) and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE). Intuitively, the act of detection is the result of the reasoning process that explains the sarcasm. Current research predominantly focuses on addressing either MSD or MuSE as a single task. Even though some recent work has attempted to integrate these tasks, their inherent causal dependency is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose MuVaC, a variational causal inference framework that mimics human cognitive mechanisms for understanding sarcasm, enabling robust multimodal feature learning to jointly optimize MSD and MuSE. Specifically, we first model MSD and MuSE from the perspective of structural causal models, establishing variational causal pathways to define the objectives for joint optimization. Next, we design an alignment-then-fusion approach to integrate multimodal features, providing robust fusion representations for sarcasm detection and explanation generation. Finally, we enhance the reasoning trustworthiness by ensuring consistency between detection results and explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MuVaC in public datasets, offering a new perspective for understanding multimodal sarcasm.

TL;DR: The paper presents BMAM, a memory architecture inspired by cognitive systems, that organizes memory into specialized subsystems to address temporal reasoning challenges in language-model-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining temporally grounded information and consistent behavior across extended interactions in language-model-based agents.

Method: BMAM decomposes memory into episodic, semantic, salience-aware, and control-oriented components, organizing them along explicit timelines to facilitate long-horizon reasoning.

Result: BMAM achieves 78.45% accuracy on the LoCoMo benchmark under long-horizon evaluation, with its hippocampus-inspired episodic memory subsystem being crucial for temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: BMAM successfully models memory as specialized subsystems and shows significant improvement in addressing temporal challenges in extended interaction settings.

Abstract: Language-model-based agents operating over extended interaction horizons face persistent challenges in preserving temporally grounded information and maintaining behavioral consistency across sessions, a failure mode we term soul erosion. We present BMAM (Brain-inspired Multi-Agent Memory), a general-purpose memory architecture that models agent memory as a set of functionally specialized subsystems rather than a single unstructured store. Inspired by cognitive memory systems, BMAM decomposes memory into episodic, semantic, salience-aware, and control-oriented components that operate at complementary time scales. To support long-horizon reasoning, BMAM organizes episodic memories along explicit timelines and retrieves evidence by fusing multiple complementary signals. Experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark show that BMAM achieves 78.45 percent accuracy under the standard long-horizon evaluation setting, and ablation analyses confirm that the hippocampus-inspired episodic memory subsystem plays a critical role in temporal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Rhetorical Structure Theory-based method to enhance the quality of AI-generated diagrams. Evaluations show reduced hallucinations and improved faithfulness to context, though quality varies due to LLM stochasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a concern about the quality and reliability of AI-generated materials in computing education, particularly diagrams, which this study seeks to address.

Method: A new method using Rhetorical Structure Theory with in-context examples is proposed. This approach was tested by educators who assessed the quality of 150 diagrams generated by large language models.

Result: The study found a reduced rate of AI hallucinations and improved context alignment in diagrams, but stochasticity in LLMs led to varying quality.

Conclusion: While the proposed method reduces hallucinations and enhances context accuracy, inherent stochasticity in LLMs remains a challenge. Further investigation into AI hallucination and its impact on quality is necessary.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has found a widespread use in computing education; at the same time, quality of generated materials raises concerns among educators and students. This study addresses this issue by introducing a novel method for diagram code generation with in-context examples based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), which aims to improve diagram generation by aligning models' output with user expectations. Our approach is evaluated by computer science educators, who assessed 150 diagrams generated with large language models (LLMs) for logical organization, connectivity, layout aesthetic, and AI hallucination. The assessment dataset is additionally investigated for its utility in automated diagram evaluation. The preliminary results suggest that our method decreases the rate of factual hallucination and improves diagram faithfulness to provided context; however, due to LLMs' stochasticity, the quality of the generated diagrams varies. Additionally, we present an in-depth analysis and discussion on the connection between AI hallucination and the quality of generated diagrams, which reveals that text contexts of higher complexity lead to higher rates of hallucination and LLMs often fail to detect mistakes in their output.

*Kumiko Nakajima,Jan Zuiderveld,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper critiques existing evaluations of creative capabilities in large language models, introduces a novel evaluation method called Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT), and provides insights into the trade-offs between creativity and appropriateness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacy in assessing creativity in large language models (LLMs), as prior evaluations like the Divergent Association Task (DAT) ignore core elements like appropriateness, compromising their validity.

Method: The authors ground their evaluation in human creativity theory, define creativity as novelty combined with appropriateness, and propose CDAT to assess contextual creativity more effectively. Comparative analysis of various state-of-the-art LLMs was conducted to validate their approach.

Result: Findings from the CDAT evaluation reveal that smaller language models often exhibit higher creativity by balancing novelty and appropriateness, while larger, advanced models favor appropriateness at the expense of novelty.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that existing creativity evaluation metrics are flawed, and CDAT provides a more reliable framework. It also highlights potential trade-offs between training/aligning LLMs and their creative outputs, along with released dataset and code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in verbal creative tasks. However, previous assessments of the creative capabilities of LLMs remain weakly grounded in human creativity theory and are thus hard to interpret. The widely used Divergent Association Task (DAT) focuses on novelty, ignoring appropriateness, a core component of creativity. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DAT and show that their scores on the task are lower than those of two baselines that do not possess any creative abilities, undermining its validity for model evaluation. Grounded in human creativity theory, which defines creativity as the combination of novelty and appropriateness, we introduce Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT). CDAT evaluates novelty conditional on contextual appropriateness, separating noise from creativity better than DAT, while remaining simple and objective. Under CDAT, smaller model families often show the most creativity, whereas advanced families favor appropriateness at lower novelty. We hypothesize that training and alignment likely shift models along this frontier, making outputs more appropriate but less creative. We release the dataset and code.

TL;DR: The paper finds spontaneous symmetry breaking in NLP models, evident during pre-training and fine-tuning, driven by individual node behavior and cooperative effects among them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore spontaneous symmetry breaking in NLP models analogous to behaviors seen in physics, but under deterministic dynamics and finite architectures.

Method: This study investigates symmetry breaking behaviors in individual attention heads and nodes within a simplified BERT-6 architecture through pre-training on Wikipedia and fine-tuning with FewRel classification.

Result: Experimental analysis reveals spontaneous symmetry breaking, where individual nodes in the network learn specific tasks and exhibit cooperative learning behaviors for improved performance.

Conclusion: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in NLP models presents unique parallels to physical systems, providing insights into their learning dynamics and potential optimization strategies for neural architectures.

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in statistical mechanics primarily occurs during phase transitions at the thermodynamic limit where the Hamiltonian preserves inversion symmetry, yet the low-temperature free energy exhibits reduced symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis. Results are demonstrated using BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel classification task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the effects of language contact in a monolingual model for Persian, finding contact-selective effects on intermediate representations, particularly in morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how historical language contact influences the intermediate representations in a monolingual language model, particularly for a contact-rich language like Persian.

Method: The researchers probe a Persian-trained monolingual model using languages with different degrees of historical contact. They analyze morphosyntactic information encoded in intermediate representations across model layers.

Result: Universal syntactic information appears insensitive to language contact. However, morphological features such as Gender and Case show strong effects shaped by language-specific structures.

Conclusion: Language contact effects on monolingual models are selective, with morphology being more affected than syntax, hinting at structural constraints in how contact influences representations.

Abstract: We investigate structural traces of language contact in the intermediate representations of a monolingual language model. Focusing on Persian (Farsi) as a historically contact-rich language, we probe the representations of a Persian-trained model when exposed to languages with varying degrees and types of contact with Persian. Our methodology quantifies the amount of linguistic information encoded in intermediate representations and assesses how this information is distributed across model components for different morphosyntactic features. The results show that universal syntactic information is largely insensitive to historical contact, whereas morphological features such as Case and Gender are strongly shaped by language-specific structure, suggesting that contact effects in monolingual language models are selective and structurally constrained.

TL;DR: AI agents excel in complex tasks, but their practical capability in daily life remains underexplored. The paper introduces a benchmark, AgentIF-OneDay, to evaluate AI performance across diverse daily tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluation metrics focus on task complexity, neglecting diversity necessary for daily scenarios, which limits understanding of AI’s practical capabilities among general users.

Method: They propose AgentIF-OneDay benchmark covering diverse daily tasks, divided into three categories: Open Workflow Execution, Latent Instruction, and Iterative Refinement. Tasks are evaluated using a collaborative rubric designed to align LLM-based verification and human judgment.

Result: AgentIF-OneDay benchmarked tasks with leading AI agents, achieving 80.1% alignment between human and AI evaluation, showing that top-tier APIs and RL-trained ChatGPT agents perform well in practical, diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight agentic capabilities of AI, emphasizing their value in developing cutting-edge applications for daily workflows through effective evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S) to improve reinforcement learning for general-domain reasoning tasks, addressing the lack of fine-grained supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for general-domain reasoning (like RLVR or RLPR) struggle due to the absence of verifiable and fine-grained reward signals for reasoning steps.

Method: P2S calculates a Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR) for each reasoning step by synthesizing and filtering a high-quality reference reasoning chain and evaluating conditional probabilities.

Result: P2S significantly outperforms baseline methods in various benchmarks such as reading comprehension and medical Question Answering tasks.

Conclusion: P2S provides a solution to reward sparsity in reinforcement learning through fine-grained process rewards, improving reasoning capabilities without requiring manual annotations or separate reward models.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning in structured domains like mathematics and programming, its application to general-domain reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of verifiable reward signals. To this end, methods like Reinforcement Learning with Reference Probability Reward (RLPR) have emerged, leveraging the probability of generating the final answer as a reward signal. However, these outcome-focused approaches neglect crucial step-by-step supervision of the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we introduce Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S), a novel self-supervision framework that provides fine-grained process rewards without requiring a separate reward model or human-annotated reasoning steps. During reinforcement learning, P2S synthesizes and filters a high-quality reference reasoning chain (gold-CoT). The core of our method is to calculate a Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR) for each reasoning step, which is derived from the conditional probability of generating the gold-CoT's suffix, given the model's current reasoning prefix. Crucially, this PFR can be flexibly integrated with any outcome-based reward, directly tackling the reward sparsity problem by providing dense guidance. Extensive experiments on reading comprehension and medical Question Answering benchmarks show that P2S significantly outperforms strong baselines.

### [106] [A Dialectic Pipeline for Improving LLM Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20659)
*Sara Candussio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a dialectic pipeline for language models, enabling self-dialogue to improve answer quality without compromising generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle language model hallucinations and enhance quality outputs while avoiding computationally demanding methods or domain constraints.

Method: A dialectic pipeline is introduced where language models engage in self-dialogue to identify and correct errors, using enriched context in an oracle-RAG setting. Different datasets, model families, and pipeline settings are tested.

Result: The dialectic pipeline surpasses standard model answers and outperforms Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces hallucinations and improves response quality while maintaining generalization flexibility in language models.

Abstract: Assessing ways in which Language Models can reduce their hallucinations and improve the outputs' quality is crucial to ensure their large-scale use.
  However, methods such as fine-tuning on domain-specific data or the training of a separate \textit{ad hoc} verifier require demanding computational resources (not feasible for many user applications) and constrain the models to specific fields of knowledge.
  In this thesis, we propose a dialectic pipeline that preserves LLMs' generalization abilities while improving the quality of its answer via self-dialogue, enabling it to reflect upon and correct tentative wrong answers.
  We experimented with different pipeline settings, testing our proposed method on different datasets and on different families of models. All the pipeline stages are enriched with the relevant context (in an oracle-RAG setting) and a study on the impact of its summarization or its filtering is conducted.
  We find that our proposed dialectic pipeline is able to outperform by significative margins the standard model answers and that it consistently achieves higher performances than Chain-of-Thought only prompting.

*Juan Jose Rubio Jan,Jack Wu,Julia Ive*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for querying structured data and extracting information from unstructured clinical text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve data interaction and extraction efficiency in EHR systems using state-of-the-art LLMs, addressing challenges in handling large datasets and unstructured data.

Method: The researchers developed an evaluation framework with automatic generation of synthetic QA pairs, tested LLMs using a subset of MIMIC III data, and applied metrics like exact-match, semantic similarity, and human judgment to gauge performance.

Result: LLMs showcased their ability to interact accurately with structured datasets and reliably extract semantically correct information from unstructured text in health records.

Conclusion: LLMs hold promise for enhancing clinical workflows by facilitating precise querying and information extraction tasks in EHR systems.

Abstract: This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to two foundational Electronic Health Record (EHR) data science tasks: structured data querying (using programmatic languages, Python/Pandas) and information extraction from unstructured clinical text via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We test the ability of LLMs to interact accurately with large structured datasets for analytics and the reliability of LLMs in extracting semantically correct information from free text health records when supported by RAG. To this end, we presented a flexible evaluation framework that automatically generates synthetic question and answer pairs tailored to the characteristics of each dataset or task. Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to support precise querying and accurate information extraction in clinical workflows.

*Zhuo Chen,Xinyu Geng,Xinyu Wang,Yong Jiang,Zhen Zhang,Pengjun Xie,Kewei Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method to train a multimodal planning agent for Visual Question-Answering (VQA), optimizing efficiency and effectiveness by dynamically refining multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and inherent dependencies in existing multi-stage mRAG pipelines used for knowledge-intensive VQA queries while maintaining performance.

Method: Develop and train a multimodal planning agent that dynamically decomposes the mRAG pipeline, intelligently deciding when each step is necessary to optimize performance and reduce computational overhead.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces search time by over 60% and outperforms baseline methods, including Deep Research agents and prompt-based approaches, across six datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal planning agent improves VQA task performance by balancing efficiency and effectiveness, significantly reducing computational costs while outperforming existing frameworks. The authors plan to release the code.

Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires integrating visual and textual information to generate accurate responses. While multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has shown promise in enhancing VQA systems by providing more evidence on both image and text sides, the default procedure that addresses VQA queries, especially the knowledge-intensive ones, often relies on multi-stage pipelines of mRAG with inherent dependencies. To mitigate the inefficiency limitations while maintaining VQA task performance, this paper proposes a method that trains a multimodal planning agent, dynamically decomposing the mRAG pipeline to solve the VQA task. Our method optimizes the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness by training the agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step. In our experiments, the agent can help reduce redundant computations, cutting search time by over 60\% compared to existing methods and decreasing costly tool calls. Meanwhile, experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including a Deep Research agent and a carefully designed prompt-based method, on average over six various datasets. Code will be released.

*Mingqiao Mo,Yunlong Tan,Hao Zhang,Heng Zhang,Yangfan He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShieldedCode, a protection-aware framework designed to improve VMP-protected code representation and generate robust protected software using learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the software security threat posed by reverse engineering and to overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based virtual machine protection (VMP) systems, which are rigid, costly, and vulnerable.

Method: The framework involves building large-scale paired datasets of source code and VM implementations, hierarchical dependency modeling, functionality-aware and protection-aware objectives, a two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, and a protection effectiveness optimization task for resilience evaluation.

Result: ShieldedCode outperforms state-of-the-art methods: achieving 26.95% Pass@1 in L0 VM code generation compared to 22.58% for GPT-4o, and improving binary similarity detection Recall@1 by 10%.

Conclusion: The framework advances robust protection-aware code representations and software security through a learning-driven approach, opening a new avenue for enhancing software defense against reverse engineering vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their potential for software protection remains largely untapped. Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our method achieves 26.95% Pass@1 on L0 VM code generation compared to 22.58% for GPT-4o., and improves binary similarity detection Recall@1 by 10% over state of art methods like jTrans.

*Ostap Vykhopen,Viktoria Skorik,Maxim Tereschenko,Veronika Solopova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses scalability challenges in narrative intelligence systems for social media monitoring by replacing batch clustering (HDBSCAN) with online clustering methods, while evaluating their performance across several dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability issues and inefficiencies of batch clustering methods like HDBSCAN in processing continuous social media data streams.

Method: A three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) is used to evaluate online clustering algorithms through simulations on historical datasets and multiple metrics (e.g., Silhouette Coefficient, narrative metrics).

Result: The study demonstrates trade-offs between cluster quality, efficiency, and adaptability when using online clustering methods, providing insights into optimizing narrative monitoring pipelines.

Conclusion: Online clustering methods can offer better scalability and real-time adaptability compared to batch clustering algorithms, bridging gaps in social media monitoring systems.

Abstract: Automated narrative intelligence systems for social media monitoring face significant scalability challenges when processing continuous data streams using traditional batch clustering algorithms. We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts. This research addresses a critical gap between batch-oriented topic modeling frameworks and the streaming nature of social media monitoring, with implications for computational social science, crisis informatics, and narrative surveillance systems.

*Shicheng Fang,Yuxin Wang,XiaoRan Liu,Jiahao Lu,Chuanyuan Tan,Xinchi Chen,Yining Zheng. Xuanjing Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentLongBench, a benchmarking framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents handling dynamic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static benchmarks that do not simulate complex agent-environment interactions, such as non-linear reasoning and feedback.

Method: Developed AgentLongBench, a framework employing Lateral Thinking Puzzles to create simulated environment rollouts for evaluating dynamic interactions.

Result: Findings reveal state-of-the-art models struggle with dynamic information synthesis, particularly in handling high information density, compared to static retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant challenges in workflows requiring dynamic information synthesis, underlining the need for improved context management and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.

### [112] [QueerGen: How LLMs Reflect Societal Norms on Gender and Sexuality in Sentence Completion Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20731)
*Mae Sosto,Delfina Sol Martinez Pandiani,Laura Hollink*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly related to heterocisnormativity, by assessing their responses across various subject categories and dimensions.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and measure how societal norms, especially heterocisnormativity, are reproduced and transformed into biases within the outputs of LLMs.

Method: Examines LLM behavior across three subject categories (queer-marked, non-queer-marked, unmarked) using measurable differences in sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Evaluates masked and autoregressive language models.

Result: MLMs produce unfavorable outputs for queer-marked subjects, while ARLMs show partial improvement. Closed-access ARLMs amplify biases against unmarked subjects. Bias varies by model type and characteristics.

Conclusion: LLMs reflect normative societal biases rather than eliminating them, based on their architecture. Model characteristics significantly influence the degree and type of representational harm.

Abstract: This paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce societal norms, particularly heterocisnormativity, and how these norms translate into measurable biases in their text generations. We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized "unmarked" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.

*Elham Aghakhani,Rezvaneh Rezapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how users evaluate and relate to large language models (LLMs) used for emotional support and mental health support outside clinical settings, using Reddit posts from mental health communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how people perceive LLMs for emotional and mental health support in real-world contexts, especially given their rising use and unexplored dynamics around trust, effectiveness, and alignment with users' emotional needs.

Method: The authors analyze 5,126 Reddit posts from mental health communities, applying a hybrid LLM-human annotation framework grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory to study user attitudes, relational alignment, and evaluative language.

Result: The study finds that users' engagement with LLMs is influenced more by outcomes, response quality, and trust, rather than emotional bonding alone. Positive sentiment is tied to task alignment, while issues like dependence and symptom escalation arise in companionship-oriented use cases.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that theory-driven approaches can effectively analyze large-scale discourse, and it highlights the need to understand users' interpretations of LLMs in sensitive, real-world contexts to address risks and optimize their utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for emotional support and mental health-related interactions outside clinical settings, yet little is known about how people evaluate and relate to these systems in everyday use. We analyze 5,126 Reddit posts from 47 mental health communities describing experiential or exploratory use of AI for emotional support or therapy. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, we develop a theory-informed annotation framework and apply a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to analyze evaluative language, adoption-related attitudes, and relational alignment at scale. Our results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is most strongly associated with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use more often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks such as dependence and symptom escalation. Overall, this work demonstrates how theory-grounded constructs can be operationalized in large-scale discourse analysis and highlights the importance of studying how users interpret language technologies in sensitive, real-world contexts.

*Jing Yang,Moritz Hechtbauer,Elisabeth Khalilov,Evelyn Luise Brinkmann,Vera Schmitt,Nils Feldhus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how Persona Prompting (PP) affects Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance and explanations in socially sensitive tasks like hate speech detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether Persona Prompting improves model alignment and explanations with specific demographic personas, particularly for tasks requiring social sensitivity.

Method: The study uses datasets annotated with word-level rationales to evaluate LLM agreement with human rationales from different demographics, analyzing PP's effect on bias and user alignment.

Result: The research identifies that while PP enhances task classification it degrades rationale quality, fails to align personas with real-world demographics, and maintains demographic biases.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a trade-off between improving classification via PP and degrading rationale quality, suggesting the need for cautious application of Persona Prompting in sensitive contexts.

Abstract: For socially sensitive tasks like hate speech detection, the quality of explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for factors like user trust and model alignment. While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.

*Yiran Huang,Karsten Roth,Quentin Bouniot,Wenjia Xu,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how transformers associate information across modalities during in-context learning (ICL) through controlled experiments with synthetic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the mechanism behind multimodal in-context learning in transformers and how they process cross-modal information.

Method: Small transformers are trained on synthetic classification tasks with controlled data statistics and architecture variations. The study revisits unimodal principles and extends to multimodal analysis.

Result: Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) increase the complexity threshold for unimodal ICL. Multimodal ICL emerges with low secondary modality data complexity when paired with high-diversity primary modalities.

Conclusion: Mechanistic analysis reveals an induction-style mechanism for label copying across modalities during ICL, contributing to understanding multimodal transformers and providing tools for further studies.

Abstract: Transformer-based multimodal large language models often exhibit in-context learning (ICL) abilities. Motivated by this phenomenon, we ask: how do transformers learn to associate information across modalities from in-context examples? We investigate this question through controlled experiments on small transformers trained on synthetic classification tasks, enabling precise manipulation of data statistics and model architecture. We begin by revisiting core principles of unimodal ICL in modern transformers. While several prior findings replicate, we find that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) increases the data complexity threshold for ICL. Extending to the multimodal setting reveals a fundamental learning asymmetry: when pretrained on high-diversity data from a primary modality, surprisingly low data complexity in the secondary modality suffices for multimodal ICL to emerge. Mechanistic analysis shows that both settings rely on an induction-style mechanism that copies labels from matching in-context exemplars; multimodal training refines and extends these circuits across modalities. Our findings provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding multimodal ICL in modern transformers and introduce a controlled testbed for future investigation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid example selection strategy for improving one-shot relation extraction using in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance one-shot relation extraction through better example selection techniques.

Method: Uses a novel strategy where additional examples are selected based on syntactic-semantic similarity to the one-shot example, combined with LLM-generated examples.

Result: The proposed hybrid selection system achieves state-of-the-art results on FS-TACRED and significant gains on FS-FewRel datasets.

Conclusion: Hybrid example selection outperforms individual strategies and successfully generalizes across datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents several strategies to automatically obtain additional examples for in-context learning of one-shot relation extraction. Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy for example selection, in which new examples are selected based on the similarity of their underlying syntactic-semantic structure to the provided one-shot example. We show that this method results in complementary word choices and sentence structures when compared to LLM-generated examples. When these strategies are combined, the resulting hybrid system achieves a more holistic picture of the relations of interest than either method alone. Our framework transfers well across datasets (FS-TACRED and FS-FewRel) and LLM families (Qwen and Gemma). Overall, our hybrid selection method consistently outperforms alternative strategies and achieves state-of-the-art performance on FS-TACRED and strong gains on a customized FewRel subset.

*Andrew Kyle Lampinen,Yuxuan Li,Eghbal Hosseini,Sangnie Bhardwaj,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies the dynamics of language model representations during conversations, showing that these representations can change significantly and are content-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how high-level concept representations evolve within language models during conversational interactions, and to explore the implications for interpretability and steering.

Method: Analyzed the representational changes in language models during simulated conversations using linear directions, tested across various models, layers, and conditions (e.g., replaying conversation scripts).

Result: Representations shifted significantly during conversations, influenced by context and content. Some changes occurred even without direct conversational stimuli, while certain types of fixed contextual frames showed weaker adaptation effects.

Conclusion: Static interpretations of language model representations may be misleading due to dynamic representational changes. However, this opens new avenues for studying how models adapt to different contexts.

Abstract: Language model representations often contain linear directions that correspond to high-level concepts. Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the beginning of a conversation can be represented as non-factual at the end and vice versa. These changes are content-dependent; while representations of conversation-relevant information may change, generic information is generally preserved. These changes are robust even for dimensions that disentangle factuality from more superficial response patterns, and occur across different model families and layers of the model. These representation changes do not require on-policy conversations; even replaying a conversation script written by an entirely different model can produce similar changes. However, adaptation is much weaker from simply having a sci-fi story in context that is framed more explicitly as such. We also show that steering along a representational direction can have dramatically different effects at different points in a conversation. These results are consistent with the idea that representations may evolve in response to the model playing a particular role that is cued by a conversation. Our findings may pose challenges for interpretability and steering -- in particular, they imply that it may be misleading to use static interpretations of features or directions, or probes that assume a particular range of features consistently corresponds to a particular ground-truth value. However, these types of representational dynamics also point to exciting new research directions for understanding how models adapt to context.

*David Tan,Pinzhen Chen,Josef van Genabith,Koel Dutta Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can show inflated multilingual benchmark scores due to contamination, masking memorization rather than true generalization, and this effect is studied using FLORES-200.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how benchmark contamination in multilingual language models affects their evaluation, with a focus on distinguishing memorization from true generalization.

Method: Two instruction-tuned multilingual LLMs (Bloomz and Llama) are studied using the FLORES-200 translation benchmark to diagnose contamination effects, including using techniques like paraphrasing and named entity replacement.

Result: Bloomz is shown to have FLORES contamination, with cross-directional memorization observed. Target-side memorization persisted even under source perturbation strategies, but replacing named entities consistently reduced BLEU scores.

Conclusion: Benchmark contamination can lead to misleading performance improvements, particularly in multilingual contexts, and techniques like named entity replacement are effective for probing contamination in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be benchmark-contaminated, resulting in inflated scores that mask memorization as generalization, and in multilingual settings, this memorization can even transfer to "uncontaminated" languages. Using the FLORES-200 translation benchmark as a diagnostic, we study two 7-8B instruction-tuned multilingual LLMs: Bloomz, which was trained on FLORES, and Llama as an uncontaminated control. We confirm Bloomz's FLORES contamination and demonstrate that machine translation contamination can be cross-directional, artificially boosting performance in unseen translation directions due to target-side memorization. Further analysis shows that recall of memorized references often persists despite various source-side perturbation efforts like paraphrasing and named entity replacement. However, replacing named entities leads to a consistent decrease in BLEU, suggesting an effective probing method for memorization in contaminated models.

*Gautham Vinod,Bruce Coburn,Siddeshwar Raghavan,Jiangpeng He,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to achieve true-to-scale 3D object reconstruction from monocular images, targeting improved dietary assessment in precision nutrition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately assessing portion sizes from food images is critical due to the rise in diet-related chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes. Current methods struggle with recovering real-world object scales, limiting precision nutrition.

Method: The paper proposes leveraging rich visual features from models trained on large datasets to estimate the scale of 3D reconstructed objects, converting single-view reconstructions into physically meaningful models.

Result: The method reduces the volume-estimation error by nearly 30% compared to existing techniques, as validated through tests on two public datasets.

Conclusion: This approach advances dietary measurement precision in digital health by bridging 3D computer vision and nutrition, making portion estimation more accurate and reliable.

Abstract: The rise of chronic diseases related to diet, such as obesity and diabetes, emphasizes the need for accurate monitoring of food intake. While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object. This learned scale enables us to convert single-view 3D reconstructions into true-to-life, physically meaningful models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two publicly available datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving nearly a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error, showcasing its potential to enhance the domain of precision nutrition.

*Zhen Yao,Xin Li,Taotao Jing,Shuai Zhang,Mooi Choo Chuah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiSa, a novel framework that focuses on improving open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by addressing limitations of vision-language models like CLIP, such as foreground bias and poor spatial localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the limitations of vision-language models in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly their bias towards foreground regions and inability to provide sharp object boundaries.

Method: The method involves DiSa, a framework with two modules: a Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM) to handle foreground and background separately, and a Hierarchical Refinement Module (HRM) to enable pixel-wise and channel-wise feature refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks indicate that DiSa consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: DiSa effectively addresses foreground bias and improves spatial localization in vision-language models, making it a significant contribution to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign labels to every pixel in an image based on text labels. Existing approaches typically utilize vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for dense prediction. However, VLMs, pre-trained on image-text pairs, are biased toward salient, object-centric regions and exhibit two critical limitations when adapted to segmentation: (i) Foreground Bias, which tends to ignore background regions, and (ii) Limited Spatial Localization, resulting in blurred object boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce DiSa, a novel saliency-aware foreground-background disentangled framework. By explicitly incorporating saliency cues in our designed Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM), DiSa separately models foreground and background ensemble features in a divide-and-conquer manner. Additionally, we propose a Hierarchical Refinement Module (HRM) that leverages pixel-wise spatial contexts and enables channel-wise feature refinement through multi-level updates. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Atik Faysal,Mohammad Rostami,Reihaneh Gh. Roshan,Nikhil Muralidhar,Huaxia Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semi-Supervised Masked Autoencoder (SSMAE) to effectively train Vision Transformers using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data by combining masked image reconstruction with dynamic pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in Vision Transformers' performance when labeled data is scarce and to utilize the abundance of unlabeled data efficiently.

Method: The proposed SSMAE framework integrates masked image reconstruction and classification by dynamically selecting pseudo-labels only when the model achieves high-confidence and consistent predictions, leveraging weakly and strongly augmented views.

Result: SSMAE outperforms baseline models, especially in low-label regimes, achieving 9.24% better accuracy than ViT on CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of carefully timing the introduction of pseudo-labels to optimize data-efficient transformer training, proving its effectiveness in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: We address the challenge of training Vision Transformers (ViTs) when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data is abundant. We propose Semi-Supervised Masked Autoencoder (SSMAE), a framework that jointly optimizes masked image reconstruction and classification using both unlabeled and labeled samples with dynamically selected pseudo-labels. SSMAE introduces a validation-driven gating mechanism that activates pseudo-labeling only after the model achieves reliable, high-confidence predictions that are consistent across both weakly and strongly augmented views of the same image, reducing confirmation bias. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, SSMAE consistently outperforms supervised ViT and fine-tuned MAE, with the largest gains in low-label regimes (+9.24% over ViT on CIFAR-10 with 10% labels). Our results demonstrate that when pseudo-labels are introduced is as important as how they are generated for data-efficient transformer training.

### [122] [Sparse CLIP: Co-Optimizing Interpretability and Performance in Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20075)
*Chuan Qin,Constantin Venhoff,Sonia Joseph,Fanyi Xiao,Stefan Scherer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Sparse CLIP," an approach integrating sparsity in CLIP training to improve interpretability without sacrificing performance or multimodal capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to challenge the assumption that interpretability and model performance are inversely related by directly incorporating sparsity into CLIP training to improve interpretability while preserving multimodal and downstream task effectiveness.

Method: The proposed method trains Sparse CLIP by embedding sparsity in the initial training process, unlike post-hoc approaches like Sparse Autoencoders, which often degrade performance and multimodal properties.

Result: Sparse CLIP achieves both good performance and superior interpretability, retaining multimodal capabilities. It also enhances semantic alignment and reveals cross-modal training dynamics.

Conclusion: Interpretability and performance can be co-optimized, challenging traditional assumptions and providing a framework for designing models with both properties in future applications.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in vision-language representation learning, powering diverse downstream tasks and serving as the default vision backbone in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite its success, CLIP's dense and opaque latent representations pose significant interpretability challenges. A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal.
  We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom that interpretability requires sacrificing accuracy and demonstrate that interpretability and performance can be co-optimized, offering a promising design principle for future models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on standardizing and evaluating datasets for nuclei instance segmentation in H&E-stained histological images, rather than creating new models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of standardized datasets and fair benchmarking practices, which limits progress in nuclei instance segmentation using H&E-stained images.

Method: The authors identified publicly available datasets, standardized them, and evaluated their performance using two state-of-the-art segmentation models. They also proposed NucFuse-test and NucFuse-train as unified test and training datasets.

Result: The study provided a systematic evaluation and ranking of the datasets, improved segmentation performance using fused datasets, and external validation. The implementation was made publicly available.

Conclusion: This work offers a new benchmark for training and evaluating nuclei instance segmentation models using standardized datasets, which can aid in the development of improved methods.

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images plays an important role in automated histological image analysis, with various applications in downstream tasks. While several machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed for nuclei instance segmentation, most research in this field focuses on developing new segmentation algorithms and benchmarking them on a limited number of arbitrarily selected public datasets.
  In this work, rather than focusing on model development, we focused on the datasets used for this task. Based on an extensive literature review, we identified manually annotated, publicly available datasets of H&E-stained images for nuclei instance segmentation and standardized them into a unified input and annotation format. Using two state-of-the-art segmentation models, one based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and one based on a hybrid CNN and vision transformer architecture, we systematically evaluated and ranked these datasets based on their nuclei instance segmentation performance. Furthermore, we proposed a unified test set (NucFuse-test) for fair cross-dataset evaluation and a unified training set (NucFuse-train) for improved segmentation performance by merging images from multiple datasets.
  By evaluating and ranking the datasets, performing comprehensive analyses, generating fused datasets, conducting external validation, and making our implementation publicly available, we provided a new benchmark for training, testing, and evaluating nuclei instance segmentation models on H&E-stained histological images.

### [124] [Look in the Middle: Structural Anchor Pruning for Scalable Visual RAG Indexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20107)
*Zhuchenyang Liu,Ziyu Hu,Yao Zhang,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a method for highly-compressed and efficient Visual Document Retrieval, achieving significant size reductions without sacrificing retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and size overhead issues of recent Vision-Language Models for visual document retrieval and to enhance highly-compressive pruning methods.

Method: Proposes Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP) to prune relevant visual patches in middle layers for better compression and introduces an Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to assess the information impact layer-wise.

Result: SAP achieves over 90% reduction in index vector size while maintaining high retrieval fidelity on the ViDoRe benchmark. OSR analysis shows semantic structural information persists in middle layers, enhancing scalability.

Conclusion: Training-free pruning like SAP can effectively compress visual tokens for retrieval by leveraging middle-layer structural signals, providing scalable and efficient solutions for Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (e.g., ColPali) enable fine-grained Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) but incur prohibitive index vector size overheads. Training-free pruning solutions (e.g., EOS-attention based methods) can reduce index vector size by approximately 60% without model adaptation, but often underperform random selection in high-compression scenarios (> 80%). Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression. We also introduce Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to evaluate how layer-wise information affects compression efficiency. Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG. Furthermore, our OSR-based analysis reveals that semantic structural anchor patches persist in the middle layers, unlike traditional pruning solutions that focus on the final layer where structural signals dissipate.

*Zhewen Wan,Tianchen Song,Chen Lin,Zhiyong Zhao,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured token pruning strategy for diffusion-based multimodal models, reducing computational cost by removing some visual tokens during inference while preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based multimodal models like LLaDA-V face significant computational overhead due to their iterative denoising and bidirectional attention mechanism, motivating the need for a computationally efficient approach.

Method: An attention analysis revealed delayed semantic alignment in middle-to-late layers of LLaDA-V. Based on this, the authors designed a token pruning strategy targeting specific layers during the first denoising step, selectively removing visual tokens to preserve critical semantics while reducing FLOPs.

Result: The method reduces computational cost by up to 65% and retains 95% task performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of visual token pruning to achieve efficient inference in diffusion-based large multimodal models, serving as a novel and practical strategy for balancing computational efficiency and semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large multimodal models, such as LLaDA-V, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in vision-language understanding and generation. However, their bidirectional attention mechanism and diffusion-style iterative denoising paradigm introduce significant computational overhead, as visual tokens are repeatedly processed across all layers and denoising steps. In this work, we conduct an in-depth attention analysis and reveal that, unlike autoregressive decoders, LLaDA-V aggregates cross-modal information predominantly in middle-to-late layers, leading to delayed semantic alignment. Motivated by this observation, we propose a structured token pruning strategy inspired by FastV, selectively removing a proportion of visual tokens at designated layers to reduce FLOPs while preserving critical semantic information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate structured token pruning in diffusion-based large multimodal models. Unlike FastV, which focuses on shallow-layer pruning, our method targets the middle-to-late layers of the first denoising step to align with LLaDA-V's delayed attention aggregation to maintain output quality, and the first-step pruning strategy reduces the computation across all subsequent steps. Our framework provides an empirical basis for efficient LLaDA-V inference and highlights the potential of vision-aware pruning in diffusion-based multimodal models. Across multiple benchmarks, our best configuration reduces computational cost by up to 65% while preserving an average of 95% task performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleStyle, a model designed for content-preserving style transfer in images and videos, overcoming challenges in disentangling content and style features within Diffusion Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of disentangling content and style features in Diffusion Transformers for effective content-preserving style transfer.

Method: TeleStyle is built on Qwen-Image-Edit and is trained using Curriculum Continual Learning on a hybrid dataset of curated and synthesized triplets representing clean and noisy styles. It includes a video-to-video stylization module for temporal consistency.

Result: TeleStyle achieves state-of-the-art results in style similarity, content consistency, and aesthetic quality while generalizing to unseen styles.

Conclusion: TeleStyle advances image and video style transfer by combining effective training techniques, leveraging robust base capabilities, and incorporating temporal enhancements for videos, excelling across core metrics.

Abstract: Content-preserving style transfer, generating stylized outputs based on content and style references, remains a significant challenge for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) due to the inherent entanglement of content and style features in their internal representations. In this technical report, we present TeleStyle, a lightweight yet effective model for both image and video stylization. Built upon Qwen-Image-Edit, TeleStyle leverages the base model's robust capabilities in content preservation and style customization. To facilitate effective training, we curated a high-quality dataset of distinct specific styles and further synthesized triplets using thousands of diverse, in-the-wild style categories. We introduce a Curriculum Continual Learning framework to train TeleStyle on this hybrid dataset of clean (curated) and noisy (synthetic) triplets. This approach enables the model to generalize to unseen styles without compromising precise content fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a video-to-video stylization module to enhance temporal consistency and visual quality. TeleStyle achieves state-of-the-art performance across three core evaluation metrics: style similarity, content consistency, and aesthetic quality.

*Brayden Hamilton,Tim Cashmore,Peter Driscoll,Trevor Gee,Henry Williams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores automated methods to classify the severity of marine biofouling on vessel hulls using both computer vision and language models, showing that hybrid models may offer scalable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine biofouling presents ecological, economic, and biosecurity challenges, and current inspection methods using divers are risky and not scalable.

Method: Various techniques, including convolutional neural networks, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot large language models, were tested on a dataset from the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries. Structured prompts and retrieval methods were also integrated.

Result: Computer vision models were accurate at extreme severity levels but had difficulties with intermediate levels due to dataset issues. Language models performed comparably without training and yielded interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches that combine segmentation coverage with the reasoning ability of large language models could enable scalable and effective biofouling severity assessments.

Abstract: Marine biofouling on vessel hulls poses major ecological, economic, and biosecurity risks. Traditional survey methods rely on diver inspections, which are hazardous and limited in scalability. This work investigates automated classification of biofouling severity on the Level of Fouling (LoF) scale using both custom computer vision models and large multimodal language models (LLMs). Convolutional neural networks, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot LLMs were evaluated on an expert-labelled dataset from the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries. Computer vision models showed high accuracy at extreme LoF categories but struggled with intermediate levels due to dataset imbalance and image framing. LLMs, guided by structured prompts and retrieval, achieved competitive performance without training and provided interpretable outputs. The results demonstrate complementary strengths across approaches and suggest that hybrid methods integrating segmentation coverage with LLM reasoning offer a promising pathway toward scalable and interpretable biofouling assessment.

*Haoyou Deng,Keyu Yan,Chaojie Mao,Xiang Wang,Yu Liu,Changxin Gao,Nong Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseGRPO is introduced to mitigate the sparse reward problem in GRPO-based text-to-image generation by aligning human preferences with dense rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO-based methods suffer from sparse rewards, leading to mismatched feedback during denoising steps, impacting text-to-image generation.

Method: DenseGRPO introduces step-wise reward gain prediction with an ODE-based approach and a reward-aware exploration adjustment scheme to ensure fine-grained alignment and appropriate exploration space.

Result: DenseGRPO achieves better alignment of human preferences and improves performance in flow matching models, demonstrated by experiments on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: DenseGRPO emphasizes the significance of dense rewards in enhancing GRPO-based text-to-image generation and proves its effectiveness through evaluations.

Abstract: Recent GRPO-based approaches built on flow matching models have shown remarkable improvements in human preference alignment for text-to-image generation. Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DenseGRPO and highlight the critical role of the valid dense rewards in flow matching model alignment.

*Yi Zhang,Weicheng Lin,Liang-Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature Projection Learning (FPL) to efficiently adapt vision-language pre-trained models like CLIP for downstream tasks, addressing performance and efficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting vision-language pre-trained models like CLIP to downstream tasks efficiently is challenging due to limitations in performance, excessive parameters, and long training times in existing approaches.

Method: FPL transforms classification into a feature projection problem by using a projection model to reconstruct query image feature maps and calculate class scores based on reconstruction error.

Result: FPL achieves superior accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art methods in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: FPL offers a simple, efficient, and highly accurate solution for adapting CLIP models, significantly improving downstream task performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-Trained models, notably CLIP, that utilize contrastive learning have proven highly adept at extracting generalizable visual features. To inherit the well-learned knowledge of VLP models for downstream tasks, several approaches aim to adapt them efficiently with limited supervision. However, these methods either suffer from limited performance, excessive learnable parameters, or extended training times, all of which hinder their effectiveness in adapting the CLIP model to downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient and effective method called \textit{\textbf{F}eature \textbf{P}rojection \textbf{L}earning(FPL)} to address these problems. Specifically, we develop a projection model that projects class prototype features into the query image feature space and reconstructs the query image feature map. The negative average squared reconstruction error is used as the class score. In this way, we transform the classification problem into a feature projection problem. The final output of this method is a combination of the prediction from the projection model and the original pre-trained CLIP. Comprehensive empirical evaluations confirm that FPL delivers superior accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Prompt-Agnostic Evolution (PAE) to address unstable training dynamics in Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) for Vision Transformers (ViTs). PAE accelerates convergence, improves accuracy, and integrates seamlessly with various VPT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Visual Prompt Tuning methods struggle with unstable training dynamics like gradient oscillations, shallow prompt stagnation, and cross-layer mismatch, which affect convergence and degrade results.

Method: PAE uses a frequency-domain approach to initialize prompts task-aware. It ensures layer coherence via a shared Koopman operator for global transformations and introduces a Lyapunov stability-inspired regularizer to limit errors.

Result: PAE achieves 1.41x faster convergence and improves accuracy by 1–3% across 25 datasets for multiple tasks. It is compatible with existing VPT models without backbone or inference-time adjustments.

Conclusion: The proposed PAE method enhances VPT through more stable and coherent layer dynamics, better performance, faster convergence, and lightweight, seamless integration with existing frameworks.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) adapts a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) to downstream tasks by inserting a small number of learnable prompt tokens into the token sequence at each layer. However, we observe that existing VPT variants often suffer from unstable training dynamics, characterized by gradient oscillations. A layer-wise analysis reveals that shallow-layer prompts tend to stagnate early, while deeper-layer prompts exhibit high-variance oscillations, leading to cross-layer mismatch. These issues slow convergence and degrade final performance. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($\mathtt{PAE}$), which strengthens vision prompt tuning by explicitly modeling prompt dynamics. From a frequency-domain perspective, we initialize prompts in a task-aware direction by uncovering and propagating frequency shortcut patterns that the backbone inherently exploits for recognition. To ensure coherent evolution across layers, we employ a shared Koopman operator that imposes a global linear transformation instead of uncoordinated, layer-specific updates. Finally, inspired by Lyapunov stability theory, we introduce a regularizer that constrains error amplification during evolution. Extensive experiments show that $\mathtt{PAE}$ accelerates convergence with an average $1.41\times$ speedup and improves accuracy by 1--3% on 25 datasets across multiple downstream tasks. Beyond performance, $\mathtt{PAE}$ is prompt-agnostic and lightweight, and it integrates seamlessly with diverse VPT variants without backbone modification or inference-time changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of Deep Generative Models (DGM) for synthetic data generation has shown promise in boosting intra-class diversity and performance in DML tasks, but existing generative methods often lack precise control over diversity enhancement.

Method: BLenDeR uses set-theory inspired union and intersection operations on denoising residuals during the diffusion sampling process to create diverse combinations of attributes within a class.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 3.7% higher Recall@1 on CUB-200 and 1.8% higher Recall@1 on Cars-196 datasets.

Conclusion: BLenDeR effectively increases the intra-class diversity in DML by controllably synthesizing diverse attribute combinations, thus improving downstream DML task performance.

Abstract: The rise of Deep Generative Models (DGM) has enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data. When used to augment authentic data in Deep Metric Learning (DML), these synthetic samples enhance intra-class diversity and improve the performance of downstream DML tasks. We introduce BLenDeR, a diffusion sampling method designed to increase intra-class diversity for DML in a controllable way by leveraging set-theory inspired union and intersection operations on denoising residuals. The union operation encourages any attribute present across multiple prompts, while the intersection extracts the common direction through a principal component surrogate. These operations enable controlled synthesis of diverse attribute combinations within each class, addressing key limitations of existing generative approaches. Experiments on standard DML benchmarks demonstrate that BLenDeR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets and backbones. Specifically, BLenDeR achieves 3.7% increase in Recall@1 on CUB-200 and a 1.8% increase on Cars-196, compared to state-of-the-art baselines under standard experimental settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Reversible Efficient Diffusion (RED) model, enhancing detail preservation and computational efficiency in multi-modal image fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show generative capability in image fusion but often lose fine details. A computationally efficient supervised training framework is needed.

Method: The RED model utilizes explicit supervision in training to enhance image fusion while bypassing distribution estimation challenges.

Result: RED achieves better preservation of details and visual fidelity compared to existing diffusion-based image fusion models.

Conclusion: RED addresses detail loss and computational efficiency issues in diffusion-based multi-modal image fusion, offering improved performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aims to consolidate complementary information from diverse source images into a unified representation. The fused image is expected to preserve fine details and maintain high visual fidelity. While diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities in image generation, they often suffer from detail loss when applied to image fusion tasks. This issue arises from the accumulation of noise errors inherent in the Markov process, leading to inconsistency and degradation in the fused results. However, incorporating explicit supervision into end-to-end training of diffusion-based image fusion introduces challenges related to computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Reversible Efficient Diffusion (RED) model - an explicitly supervised training framework that inherits the powerful generative capability of diffusion models while avoiding the distribution estimation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gradient-aware diagnostic framework, LVLMs-Saliency, to detect and mitigate hallucinations in large vision-language models by analyzing visual grounding strength and contextual memory retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches fail to reliably distinguish hallucinations in LVLMs as they only focus on attention patterns without considering gradient-based signals.

Method: The paper proposes LVLMs-Saliency, which fuses attention weights with gradients, and introduces two mechanisms: Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS) and Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), to detect and mitigate hallucinations.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while maintaining fluency and task performance across multiple models.

Conclusion: LVLMs-Saliency offers a robust, interpretable solution to reduce hallucination rates and enhance model reliability by leveraging saliency and gradient-based diagnostics.

Abstract: Recent studies have examined attention dynamics in large vision-language models (LVLMs) to detect hallucinations. However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing domain adaptation methods that rely on source domain data, adversarial training, or pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive.

Method: The method leverages multiview augmentation and latent space consistency to learn domain-invariant features from the target domain without requiring source-target alignment. A ConvNeXt-based encoder and a tailored loss function combining classification and consistency objectives are used.

Result: The model achieved classification accuracies of 90.72%, 84%, and 97.12% on the Office-31, Office-Home, and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively, showing improvement over prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed source-free domain adaptation approach is effective and computationally efficient, surpassing existing methods in target domain classification accuracy.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain where image data distributions may differ. Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space. We also introduce a ConvNeXt-based encoder and design a loss function that combines classification and consistency objectives to drive effective adaptation directly from the target domain. The proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 90. 72\%, 84\%, and 97. 12\% in Office-31, Office-Home and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively. Further evaluations confirm that our study improves existing methods by an average classification accuracy increment of +1.23\%, +7.26\%, and +1.77\% on the respective datasets.

Motivation: With advancements in video generation, assessing generated videos' quality by identifying specific artifacts is critical to ensure realistic and reliable outputs.

Method: The paper defines artifact categories affecting human perception, creates the GenVID dataset, and develops the DVAR framework for detecting and categorizing artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments show enhanced artifact detection accuracy and better filtering of low-quality videos using DVAR framework.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation protocol, dataset, and framework enable granular understanding and mitigation of generative video artifacts, advancing video generation quality evaluations.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation techniques, evaluating and auditing generated videos has become increasingly crucial. Existing approaches typically offer coarse video quality scores, lacking detailed localization and categorization of specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol focusing on three key aspects affecting human perception: Appearance, Motion, and Camera. We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories. Leveraging GenVID, we develop DVAR, a Dense Video Artifact Recognition framework for fine-grained identification and classification of generative artifacts. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves artifact detection accuracy and enables effective filtering of low-quality content.

### [136] [Towards Compact and Robust DNNs via Compression-aware Sharpness Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20301)
*Jialuo He,Huangxun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compression-aware Sharpness Minimization (C-SAM), a method to improve compactness and robustness of DNNs when pruning, achieving significant robustness gains while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue that existing Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) techniques do not adequately account for robustness when deep neural networks (DNNs) are pruned for on-device deployment.

Method: The proposed C-SAM method incorporates perturbations in pruning masks during training, targeting a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure to reconcile pruning and robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C with ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show up to a 42% improvement in certified robustness while maintaining accuracy comparable to unpruned models.

Conclusion: C-SAM demonstrates that integrating mask perturbations during training effectively creates compact DNNs with improved robustness to input variations, overcoming the limitations of standard pruning techniques.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has recently emerged as an effective technique for improving DNN robustness to input variations. However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.

*Suresh Das,Siladittya Manna,Sayantari Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance challenges in bladder segmentation due to covariate shift and proposes a dual domain learning strategy to integrate different CT datasets for improved robustness and clinical reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the issue of covariate shift in medical image segmentation, particularly in bladder segmentation during CT-guided gynecological brachytherapy, to enhance accurate dose optimization and clinical reliability.

Method: A dual domain learning method integrates abundant data from one domain (NA CT scans) with limited data from another domain (WA CT scans), using various deep learning architectures to systematically evaluate their segmentation performance.

Result: The integration of 10-30% WA data into NA-dominated training sets significantly improves segmentation performance, achieving Dice coefficients up to 0.94 and IoU scores up to 0.92, comparable to WA-only training models.

Conclusion: Integrating small proportions of distribution-shifted data (WA scans) into training improves domain adaptation, tackling data scarcity and enhancing segmentation outcomes for brachytherapy treatment planning.

Abstract: Performance degradation due to covariate shift remains a major challenge for deep learning models in medical image segmentation. An open question is whether samples from a shifted distribution can effectively support learning when combined with limited target domain data. We investigate this problem in the context of bladder segmentation in CT guided gynecological brachytherapy, a critical task for accurate dose optimization and organ at risk sparing. While CT scans without brachytherapy applicators (no applicator: NA) are widely available, scans with applicators inserted (with applicator: WA) are scarce and exhibit substantial anatomical deformation and imaging artifacts, making automated segmentation particularly difficult.
  We propose a dual domain learning strategy that integrates NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and generalizability under covariate shift. Using a curated assorted dataset, we show that NA data alone fail to capture the anatomical and artifact related characteristics of WA images. However, introducing a modest proportion of WA data into a predominantly NA training set leads to significant performance improvements. Through systematic experiments across axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using multiple deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that doping only 10 to 30 percent WA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained exclusively on WA data.
  The proposed approach attains Dice similarity coefficients of up to 0.94 and Intersection over Union scores of up to 0.92, indicating effective domain adaptation and improved clinical reliability. This study highlights the value of integrating anatomically similar but distribution shifted datasets to overcome data scarcity and enhance deep learning based segmentation for brachytherapy treatment planning.

### [138] [Physically Guided Visual Mass Estimation from a Single RGB Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20303)
*Sungjae Lee,Junhan Jeong,Yeonjoo Hong,Kwang In Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to estimate object mass from a single RGB image by using physically meaningful representations to address the ambiguity in mass prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating object mass from visual input is challenging due to the ill-posed nature of relying solely on pixels, as mass depends on geometry and material density.

Method: The framework recovers 3D geometry via monocular depth estimation and uses vision-language models for material semantics. These features are fused using an adaptive gating mechanism, and mass is predicted through two latent factors informed by physics.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods on image2mass and ABO-500 datasets.

Conclusion: Physically structured representations aligned with geometry and material cues significantly enhance single-image mass estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Estimating object mass from visual input is challenging because mass depends jointly on geometric volume and material-dependent density, neither of which is directly observable from RGB appearance. Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision. Experiments on image2mass and ABO-500 show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model called SLDM to enhance CT images using low-dose iodinated contrast media while maintaining diagnostic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for enhancing CT images from low-dose iodinated contrast media struggle with accurately recognizing specific structures and achieving image enhancement with incompletely paired data.

Method: The authors propose SLDM, which combines structural synergy, spatial intelligence, semantic supervision, and a subtraction angiography enhancement module to ensure structural consistency and improve contrast in the CT images.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates effective angiographic reconstruction for low-dose contrast medium CT angiography based on visual and quantitative comparisons.

Conclusion: SLDM is a unified medical generation model that achieves accurate enhancement of CT images using low-dose iodinated contrast medium while overcoming structural recognition limitations in prior approaches.

Abstract: The application of iodinated contrast media (ICM) improves the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for a wide range of clinical indications. However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation. Qualitative analysis of visual comparison and quantitative results of several metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in angiographic reconstruction for low-dose contrast medium CT angiography.

*Matej Halinkovic,Nina Masarykova,Alexey Vinel,Marek Galinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Li-ViP3D++, a framework for autonomous driving that integrates RGB and LiDAR data in query space, achieving improved detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues in perception-and-prediction models for autonomous driving, such as limited integration of camera and LiDAR data and inefficiencies in existing fusion schemes.

Method: The method involves the development of Li-ViP3D++, which integrates Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF). This framework aggregates camera data via masked attention, uses differentiable BEV sampling for LiDAR context, and adaptively weights cues per agent with gating mechanisms.

Result: Li-ViP3D++ demonstrates improved performance on nuScenes dataset, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502), lower false positive ratio (0.147), and faster processing time compared to its predecessor.

Conclusion: Fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion in query space significantly enhances the robustness and performance of perception-and-prediction models for autonomous driving, maintaining efficient deployability.

Abstract: End-to-end perception and trajectory prediction from raw sensor data is one of the key capabilities for autonomous driving. Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.

### [141] [TPGDiff: Hierarchical Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20306)
*Yanjie Tu,Qingsen Yan,Axi Niu,Jiacong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion network for improving all-in-one image restoration by creatively incorporating structural, semantic, and degradation priors to address restoration limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified image restoration models struggle to reconstruct severely degraded regions and face challenges like disrupted spatial structures when incorporating semantic information.

Method: The TPGDiff method combines degradation priors, structural priors in shallow layers, and semantic priors in deeper layers. It uses structural cues for fine-grained details, a semantic extractor for robust high-level guidance, and a degradation extractor to control the diffusion process adaptively.

Result: Extensive experiments show that TPGDiff outperforms other models in both single- and multi-degradation restoration tasks, achieving strong generalization to diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion network provides hierarchical and complementary prior guidance, overcoming previous limitations and advancing unified image restoration performance.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to address diverse degradation types using a single unified model. Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

### [142] [OSDEnhancer: Taming Real-World Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with One-Step Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20308)
*Shuoyan Wei,Feng Li,Chen Zhou,Runmin Cong,Yao Zhao,Huihui Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OSDEnhancer, the first method for real-world space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) using a one-step diffusion process, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STVSR methods struggle with real-world scenarios due to complex degradation and the need for both high fidelity and temporal consistency, leaving the potential of diffusion models underexplored in this domain.

Method: The proposed OSDEnhancer employs linear pre-interpolation for initializing spatiotemporal structures, a temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE) for learning robust representations, and a bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder for spatiotemporal reconstruction.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art STVSR performance, demonstrating strong generalization capability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: OSDEnhancer represents a significant step forward in tackling the challenges of real-world STVSR with its innovative framework and effective methodologies.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in video super-resolution (VSR), showcasing a powerful capacity for generating fine-grained details. However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior generalization capability in real-world scenarios.

*Jiyuan Xu,Wenyu Zhang,Xin Jing,Shuai Chen,Shuai Zhang,Jiahao Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CPiRi, a channel permutation invariant framework for tackling challenges in multivariate time series forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art results with enhanced flexibility and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle between overfitting to channel ordering and neglecting inter-channel dependencies. A solution is needed for flexible and adaptable forecasting models capable of handling dynamic settings.

Method: The authors propose CPiRi, which employs a spatio-temporal decoupling architecture and permutation-invariant training. This involves a pretrained temporal encoder, a lightweight spatial module, and channel shuffling for training robustness.

Result: CPiRi achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, remains stable under channel order shuffling, generalizes well to unseen channels, and retains efficiency on large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: CPiRi demonstrates robust performance and adaptability, enabling deployment in dynamic environments without retraining, addressing critical forecasting challenges.

Abstract: Current methods for multivariate time series forecasting can be classified into channel-dependent and channel-independent models. Channel-dependent models learn cross-channel features but often overfit the channel ordering, which hampers adaptation when channels are added or reordered. Channel-independent models treat each channel in isolation to increase flexibility, yet this neglects inter-channel dependencies and limits performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CPiRi}, a \textbf{channel permutation invariant (CPI)} framework that infers cross-channel structure from data rather than memorizing a fixed ordering, enabling deployment in settings with structural and distributional co-drift without retraining. CPiRi couples \textbf{spatio-temporal decoupling architecture} with \textbf{permutation-invariant regularization training strategy}: a frozen pretrained temporal encoder extracts high-quality temporal features, a lightweight spatial module learns content-driven inter-channel relations, while a channel shuffling strategy enforces CPI during training. We further \textbf{ground CPiRi in theory} by analyzing permutation equivariance in multivariate time series forecasting. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show state-of-the-art results. CPiRi remains stable when channel orders are shuffled and exhibits strong \textbf{inductive generalization} to unseen channels even when trained on \textbf{only half} of the channels, while maintaining \textbf{practical efficiency} on large-scale datasets.

*Mai Su,Qihan Yu,Zhongtao Wang,Yilong Li,Chengwei Pan,Yisong Chen,Guoping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for improving surface reconstruction in 3D Gaussian Splatting by addressing limitations of traditional multi-view and monocular depth consistency methods using two new constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate surface reconstruction in 3D Gaussian Splatting is challenging due to issues with multi-view geometric discrepancies and monocular depth priors' scale ambiguity and inconsistency.

Method: The authors propose two key solutions: a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint and a progressive quadtree-calibrated monocular depth constraint to improve accuracy and stability during geometric supervision.

Result: Experiments conducted on DTU and TNT datasets show better geometric accuracy compared to prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting, providing improved surface reconstruction accuracy through novel constraints.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables efficient optimization and high-quality rendering, yet accurate surface reconstruction remains challenging. Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors. However, multi-view constraints become unreliable under large geometric discrepancies, while monocular priors suffer from scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, ultimately leading to inaccurate Gaussian depth supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopoOT, a novel framework for anomaly segmentation utilizing deep topological data analysis and optimal transport. It achieves state-of-the-art results in anomaly detection benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional threshold-based anomaly detection methods struggle under distribution shifts. By leveraging topological data analysis, anomalies can be defined as disruptions to global structure rather than local changes, offering a more robust solution.

Method: TopoOT integrates multi-filtration persistence diagrams with test-time adaptation, utilizing Optimal Transport Chaining to generate stability-aware pseudo-labels that supervise online training through OT-consistency and contrastive objectives.

Result: TopoOT delivers significant improvements in anomaly detection performance, achieving up to +24.1% mean F1 on 2D datasets and +10.2% on 3D benchmarks compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: TopoOT combines topological methods and optimal transport effectively to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches, demonstrating robust anomaly segmentation under domain shifts.

Abstract: Deep topological data analysis (TDA) offers a principled framework for capturing structural invariants such as connectivity and cycles that persist across scales, making it a natural fit for anomaly segmentation (AS). Unlike thresholdbased binarisation, which produces brittle masks under distribution shift, TDA allows anomalies to be characterised as disruptions to global structure rather than local fluctuations. We introduce TopoOT, a topology-aware optimal transport (OT) framework that integrates multi-filtration persistence diagrams (PDs) with test-time adaptation (TTA). Our key innovation is Optimal Transport Chaining, which sequentially aligns PDs across thresholds and filtrations, yielding geodesic stability scores that identify features consistently preserved across scales. These stabilityaware pseudo-labels supervise a lightweight head trained online with OT-consistency and contrastive objectives, ensuring robust adaptation under domain shift. Across standard 2D and 3D anomaly detection benchmarks, TopoOT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the most competitive methods by up to +24.1% mean F1 on 2D datasets and +10.2% on 3D AS benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSF, a framework for integrating multimodal evidence in computational pathology, achieving significant performance improvements in both accuracy and survival cohort evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the integration challenges of heterogeneous data in computational pathology, such as gigapixel images and clinical descriptors, which differ in statistics and scales.

Method: The study proposes MMSF, a multitask and multimodal framework with modules for graph-based tissue topology extraction, clinical data embedding, modality alignment, and a multitask prediction using a Mamba-based MIL encoder.

Result: The framework demonstrated 2.1–6.6% accuracy and 2.2–6.9% AUC gains on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC datasets and 7.1–9.8% C-index improvements on five TCGA survival cohorts compared to unimodal and multimodal baselines.

Conclusion: MMSF effectively integrates multimodal data in computational pathology, offering superior performance across multiple metrics and datasets, thus validating its effectiveness for prognosis tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal evidence is critical in computational pathology: gigapixel whole slide images capture tumor morphology, while patient-level clinical descriptors preserve complementary context for prognosis. Integrating such heterogeneous signals remains challenging because feature spaces exhibit distinct statistics and scales. We introduce MMSF, a multitask and multimodal supervised framework built on a linear-complexity MIL backbone that explicitly decomposes and fuses cross-modal information. MMSF comprises a graph feature extraction module embedding tissue topology at the patch level, a clinical data embedding module standardizing patient attributes, a feature fusion module aligning modality-shared and modality-specific representations, and a Mamba-based MIL encoder with multitask prediction heads. Experiments on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC demonstrate 2.1--6.6\% accuracy and 2.2--6.9\% AUC improvements over competitive baselines, while evaluations on five TCGA survival cohorts yield 7.1--9.8\% C-index improvements compared with unimodal methods and 5.6--7.1\% over multimodal alternatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PalmBridge, a feature-space alignment framework aiming to improve palmprint recognition under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle performance degradation in real-world palmprint recognition due to distribution shifts in heterogeneous deployment conditions.

Method: PalmBridge uses vector quantization to align feature spaces by learning representative vectors, blending mapped features, and optimizing with orthogonality regularization and feature-consistency objectives.

Result: Experiments demonstrate PalmBridge's ability to reduce error rates in intra-dataset evaluations and improve cross-dataset generalization efficiency.

Conclusion: PalmBridge enhances robustness in palmprint recognition systems, leveraging its domain adaptation mechanism for better real-world applicability.

Abstract: Palmprint recognition is widely used in biometric systems, yet real-world performance often degrades due to feature distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous deployment conditions. Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights. Experiments on multiple palmprint datasets and backbone architectures show that PalmBridge consistently reduces EER in intra-dataset open-set evaluation and improves cross-dataset generalization with negligible to modest runtime overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialGenEval, a benchmark for assessing spatial intelligence in text-to-image models, and SpatialT2I, a dataset enhancing spatial reasoning through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with complex spatial reasoning tasks, which current benchmarks inadequately address due to simplistic prompt designs.

Method: SpatialGenEval uses 1,230 detailed prompts and evaluates through multi-choice questions. SpatialT2I enhances spatial comprehension using 15,400 well-designed text-image pairs, tested via fine-tuning state-of-the-art models.

Result: Evaluations reveal spatial reasoning challenges in current models. Fine-tuning with SpatialT2I improves accuracy and realism in spatial relationships (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%).

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that information-dense prompts and a data-centric approach can significantly improve spatial intelligence in text-to-image models.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-fidelity images, but they often fail in handling complex spatial relationships, e.g., spatial perception, reasoning, or interaction. These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene graphs often fail to generalize in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings due to overfitting to spurious correlations, limiting their robustness in scene understanding tasks.

Method: The paper proposes CURVE, combining variational uncertainty modeling with uncertainty-guided structural regularization. It uses prototype-conditioned debiasing to separate invariant features from environment-specific ones, ensuring stable topological structures.

Result: CURVE demonstrates improved performance in zero-shot transfer and sim-to-real adaptation settings, achieving domain-stable sparse topologies and providing reliable uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: CURVE enhances scene understanding by addressing overfitting and promoting generalization, offering reliable risk predictions under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Scene graphs provide structured abstractions for scene understanding, yet they often overfit to spurious correlations, severely hindering out-of-distribution generalization. To address this limitation, we propose CURVE, a causality-inspired framework that integrates variational uncertainty modeling with uncertainty-guided structural regularization to suppress high-variance, environment-specific relations. Specifically, we apply prototype-conditioned debiasing to disentangle invariant interaction dynamics from environment-dependent variations, promoting a sparse and domain-stable topology. Empirically, we evaluate CURVE in zero-shot transfer and low-data sim-to-real adaptation, verifying its ability to learn domain-stable sparse topologies and provide reliable uncertainty estimates to support risk prediction under distribution shifts.

### [150] [RAW-Flow: Advancing RGB-to-RAW Image Reconstruction with Deterministic Latent Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20364)
*Zhen Liu,Diedong Feng,Hai Jiang,Liaoyuan Zeng,Hao Wang,Chaoyu Feng,Lei Lei,Bing Zeng,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents RAW-Flow, a novel generative framework for improving RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, achieving better detail consistency and color accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-to-RAW reconstruction methods face challenges in detail inconsistency and color deviation due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and quantization losses in RGB images.

Method: The proposed RAW-Flow framework reformulates RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a latent transport problem using flow matching. It incorporates a cross-scale context guidance module and a dual-domain latent autoencoder to enhance latent transport and ensure high-fidelity reconstruction.

Result: RAW-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, producing superior visual and quantitative results compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: RAW-Flow demonstrates the effectiveness of a generative approach to RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, enabling accurate structural detail and color recovery from RGB images.

Abstract: RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, or the reverse modeling of a camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, aims to recover high-fidelity RAW data from RGB images. Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAW-Flow outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and visually.

Conclusion: RepSFNet is an effective and efficient model for accurate real-time crowd counting, showing great potential in low-power edge computing scenarios.

Abstract: Crowd counting remains challenging in variable-density scenes due to scale variations, occlusions, and the high computational cost of existing models. To address these issues, we propose RepSFNet (Reparameterized Single Fusion Network), a lightweight architecture designed for accurate and real-time crowd estimation. RepSFNet leverages a RepLK-ViT backbone with large reparameterized kernels for efficient multi-scale feature extraction. It further integrates a Feature Fusion module combining Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Context-Aware Network (CAN) to achieve robust, density-adaptive context modeling. A Concatenate Fusion module is employed to preserve spatial resolution and generate high-quality density maps. By avoiding attention mechanisms and multi-branch designs, RepSFNet significantly reduces parameters and computational complexity. The training objective combines Mean Squared Error and Optimal Transport loss to improve both count accuracy and spatial distribution alignment. Experiments conducted on ShanghaiTech, NWPU, and UCF-QNRF datasets demonstrate that RepSFNet achieves competitive accuracy while reducing inference latency by up to 34 percent compared to recent state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for real-time and low-power edge computing applications.

### [153] [HINT: Hierarchical Interaction Modeling for Autoregressive Multi-Human Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20383)
*Mengge Liu,Yan Di,Gu Wang,Yun Qu,Dekai Zhu,Yanyan Li,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HINT is an autoregressive framework for generating multi-human motion with hierarchical interaction modeling, improving adaptability for varying text sizes and participant counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with fixed-length motions, a fixed number of agents, and fail to accommodate variations in text guidance or agent counts.

Method: HINT uses a canonicalized latent space for disentangled motion representation, enabling flexible adaptations. It also employs a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation while maintaining motion coherence.

Result: HINT outperforms autoregressive baselines and achieves better FID scores (e.g., 3.100 on InterHuman vs. an older score of 5.154).

Conclusion: HINT successfully models complex inter-person interactions with scalability to varied participants and offers improved performance, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark.

Abstract: Text-driven multi-human motion generation with complex interactions remains a challenging problem. Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines. Notably, on InterHuman, HINT achieves an FID of 3.100, significantly improving over the previous state-of-the-art score of 5.154.

*Yuhao Sun,Chengyi Cai,Jiacheng Zhang,Zesheng Ye,Xingliang Yuan,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BiFTA, a method for fine-grained text-visual alignment, improving zero-shot performance by refining redundant text descriptions and localized image patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in zero-shot vision-language model performance caused by redundant information in fine-grained text descriptions and localized image patches.

Method: The BiFTA method involves two refinements: 'View refinement' removes redundant image patches with high IoU ratios, and 'Description refinement' eliminates redundant text descriptions with high cosine similarity.

Result: BiFTA applied to ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance on six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Removing redundant information in visual-text alignment significantly enhances zero-shot vision-language model performance, as demonstrated by BiFTA.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that aligning fine-grained text descriptions with localized image patches can significantly improve the zero-shot performance of pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, we find that both fine-grained text descriptions and localized image patches often contain redundant information, making text-visual alignment less effective. In this paper, we tackle this issue from two perspectives: \emph{View Refinement} and \emph{Description refinement}, termed as \textit{\textbf{Bi}-refinement for \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{T}ext-visual \textbf{A}lignment} (BiFTA). \emph{View refinement} removes redundant image patches with high \emph{Intersection over Union} (IoU) ratios, resulting in more distinctive visual samples. \emph{Description refinement} removes redundant text descriptions with high pairwise cosine similarity, ensuring greater diversity in the remaining descriptions. BiFTA achieves superior zero-shot performance on 6 benchmark datasets for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP, justifying the necessity to remove redundant information in visual-text alignment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Quartet of Diffusions," a 3D point cloud generation framework integrating symmetry and part composition for structured and high-quality shape generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-quality and structured 3D shape generation by explicitly modeling part composition and symmetry.

Method: The framework utilizes four interconnected diffusion models for learning distributions of global latents, symmetries, semantic parts, and spatial assemblies, ensuring structured and controllable generation.

Result: The framework guarantees symmetry, coherent part placement, and state-of-the-art performance in generating diverse 3D shapes.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel and interpretable approach to 3D point cloud generation, fully integrating symmetry and part priors to ensure global consistency and fine-grained control.

Abstract: We introduce the Quartet of Diffusions, a structure-aware point cloud generation framework that explicitly models part composition and symmetry. Unlike prior methods that treat shape generation as a holistic process or only support part composition, our approach leverages four coordinated diffusion models to learn distributions of global shape latents, symmetries, semantic parts, and their spatial assembly. This structured pipeline ensures guaranteed symmetry, coherent part placement, and diverse, high-quality outputs. By disentangling the generative process into interpretable components, our method supports fine-grained control over shape attributes, enabling targeted manipulation of individual parts while preserving global consistency. A central global latent further reinforces structural coherence across assembled parts. Our experiments show that the Quartet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first 3D point cloud generation framework that fully integrates and enforces both symmetry and part priors throughout the generative process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a high-performance and versatile solution for document parsing, addressing the challenges of speed, structured document handling, and robustness across various content types.

Method: The model combines a vision transformer-based visual encoder with a prompt-guided language model for layout analysis and employs high-parallelism decoding strategies (token and query parallelism) for efficient processing.

Result: Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art performance on OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks, excelling in various document parsing tasks.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates exceptional efficiency, robustness, and scalability, proving valuable for large-scale document intelligence applications.

Abstract: This paper presents Youtu-Parsing, an efficient and versatile document parsing model designed for high-performance content extraction. The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks. Overall, Youtu-Parsing demonstrates significant experimental value and practical utility for large-scale document intelligence applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The creation and rapid advancements of generative models demand improved Deepfake detection techniques. Existing approaches focus on classification or spatial localization, but they lack in alignment and explainability.

Method: MARE utilizes a combination of reinforcement learning from human feedback and a forgery disentanglement module to enhance multimodal (text-spatial) alignment and reasoning for Deepfake detection.

Result: MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting and reasoning Deepfakes, evidenced by strong quantitative and qualitative evaluation results.

Conclusion: MARE enhances the accuracy and reliability of Deepfake detection through explainable reasoning leveraging vision-language models and advanced reward mechanisms.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a widely researched topic that is crucial for combating the spread of malicious content, with existing methods mainly modeling the problem as classification or spatial localization. The rapid advancements in generative models impose new demands on Deepfake detection. In this paper, we propose multimodal alignment and reinforcement for explainable Deepfake detection via vision-language models, termed MARE, which aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in Deepfake detection and reasoning. Specifically, MARE designs comprehensive reward functions, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to incentivize the generation of text-spatially aligned reasoning content that adheres to human preferences. Besides, MARE introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture intrinsic forgery traces from high-level facial semantics, thereby improving its authenticity detection capability. We conduct thorough evaluations on the reasoning content generated by MARE. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.

*Yanzhu Liu,Xiao Liu,Yuexuan Wang,Mondal Soumik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper establishes a method to robustly detect AI-generated images by leveraging common architectural components in image generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the robustness of AI-generated image detection, as many current detectors struggle to generalize to images produced by unseen generators.

Method: The paper proposes 'contaminating' real images using the generator's final component and training a detector on this distinction, supported by a taxonomy to classify generator types.

Result: The proposed detector, fine-tuned using DINOv3, achieved an impressive average accuracy of 98.83% across 22 datasets from previously unseen image generators.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the importance of addressing shared architectural traits in generators to enhance detector generalization, achieving significant success with limited data.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of powerful image generators, accurate detection of AI-generated images has become essential for maintaining a trustworthy online environment. However, existing deepfake detectors often generalize poorly to images produced by unseen generators. Notably, despite being trained under vastly different paradigms, such as diffusion or autoregressive modeling, many modern image generators share common final architectural components that serve as the last stage for converting intermediate representations into images. Motivated by this insight, we propose to "contaminate" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images. We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability. Using only 100 samples from each of three representative categories, our detector-fine-tuned on the DINOv3 backbone-achieves an average accuracy of 98.83% across 22 testing sets from unseen generators.

TL;DR: The paper studies autoregressive video diffusion models and proposes Dummy Forcing, an optimization to improve the model's efficiency without major quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in multi-head self-attention within autoregressive video diffusion models, as some heads under-utilize historical frames.

Method: Introduces Dummy Forcing, involving heterogeneous memory allocation, dynamic head programming to classify head types, and context packing to compress cache aggressively.

Result: Achieves up to 2.0x speedup, enabling video generation at 24.3 FPS with minimal quality drop (<0.5%).

Conclusion: Dummy Forcing improves the computational efficiency of video diffusion models while maintaining high-quality output without requiring additional training.

Abstract: The autoregressive video diffusion model has recently gained considerable research interest due to its causal modeling and iterative denoising. In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop.

TL;DR: The paper explores deep learning methods for segmenting white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL) in MRI scans using partially labelled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenge of accurately segmenting and differentiating WMH and ISL from brain MRI scans, as these features visually overlap and frequently co-occur, making existing approaches less effective.

Method: The researchers employed six strategies for training deep learning models using a mix of fully and partially labelled datasets, integrating private and publicly available data with pseudolabel techniques proving effective.

Result: Among the explored strategies, pseudolabeling delivered the best segmentation outcomes, improving the model's ability to process partially labelled data.

Conclusion: Effective use of partially labelled data, particularly with pseudolabel methods, enhances the performance of deep learning models for WMH and ISL segmentation in MRI scans.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) and ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL) are imaging features associated with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) that are visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The development and validation of deep learning models to segment and differentiate these features is difficult because they visually confound each other in the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and often appear in the same subject. We investigated six strategies for training a combined WMH and ISL segmentation model using partially labelled data. We combined privately held fully and partially labelled datasets with publicly available partially labelled datasets to yield a total of 2052 MRI volumes, with 1341 and 1152 containing ground truth annotations for WMH and ISL respectively. We found that several methods were able to effectively leverage the partially labelled data to improve model performance, with the use of pseudolabels yielding the best result.

*Meiqi Wu,Bingze Song,Ruimin Lin,Chen Zhu,Xiaokun Feng,Jiahong Wu,Xiangxiang Chu,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of video generation models in dynamic scenarios by introducing a motion-aware loss weighting strategy through Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD). It improves motion quality and stability during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models use static loss for all scenarios, leading to inadequate performance in capturing complex dynamics in videos with drastic motion changes.

Method: They propose Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD), which measures frame-to-frame variation, enabling selective loss weighting to focus on regions with higher discrepancy while stabilizing optimization for static areas.

Result: LTD leads to improved reconstruction of high-frequency dynamics and achieves significant performance improvements, outperforming baselines by 3.31% on VBench and 3.58% on VMBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: LTD enhances motion video generation by stabilizing training and improving dynamic region reconstruction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved notable progress in static scenarios, yet their performance in motion video generation remains limited, with quality degrading under drastic dynamic changes. This is due to noise disrupting temporal coherence and increasing the difficulty of learning dynamic regions. {Unfortunately, existing diffusion models rely on static loss for all scenarios, constraining their ability to capture complex dynamics.} To address this issue, we introduce Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD) as a motion prior to guide loss weighting. LTD measures frame-to-frame variation in the latent space, assigning larger penalties to regions with higher discrepancy while maintaining regular optimization for stable regions. This motion-aware strategy stabilizes training and enables the model to better reconstruct high-frequency dynamics. Extensive experiments on the general benchmark VBench and the motion-focused VMBench show consistent gains, with our method outperforming strong baselines by 3.31% on VBench and 3.58% on VMBench, achieving significant improvements in motion quality.

Conclusion: CHEESE and SCheese provide effective solutions to challenges in high-quality and coherent portrait collection generation, setting a new standard in PCG research.

Abstract: As social media platforms proliferate, users increasingly demand intuitive ways to create diverse, high-quality portrait collections. In this work, we introduce Portrait Collection Generation (PCG), a novel task that generates coherent portrait collections by editing a reference portrait image through natural language instructions. This task poses two unique challenges to existing methods: (1) complex multi-attribute modifications such as pose, spatial layout, and camera viewpoint; and (2) high-fidelity detail preservation including identity, clothing, and accessories. To address these challenges, we propose CHEESE, the first large-scale PCG dataset containing 24K portrait collections and 573K samples with high-quality modification text annotations, constructed through an Large Vison-Language Model-based pipeline with inversion-based verification. We further propose SCheese, a framework that combines text-guided generation with hierarchical identity and detail preservation. SCheese employs adaptive feature fusion mechanism to maintain identity consistency, and ConsistencyNet to inject fine-grained features for detail consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CHEESE in advancing PCG, with SCheese achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the repetition issue in multimodal large language models (dMLLMs) caused by caching mechanisms, referred to as the 'Repeat Curse,' and proposes a solution called CoTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of high inference latency in dMLLMs which leads to the introduction of repetitive text generation from caching mechanisms, revealing its root cause.

Method: Analyzed the issue through information flow mechanisms, proposed CoTA as a mitigation strategy that enhances context token attention and adds penalties during decoding to prevent repetition.

Result: CoTA effectively reduces repetition and achieves consistent performance enhancements across tasks with experimental validation.

Conclusion: CoTA serves as an efficient, plug-and-play remedy to the Repeat Curse issue in dMLLMs, improving the language model's performance and reliability.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) suffer from high inference latency and therefore rely on caching techniques to accelerate decoding. However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

*Matic Fučka,Vitjan Zavrtanik,Danijel Skočaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes AnomalyVFM, a framework that improves zero-shot anomaly detection using vision foundation models (VFMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods using VFMs perform poorly due to limited auxiliary dataset diversity and suboptimal adaptation strategies.

Method: The proposed method uses a three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme and a parameter-efficient adaptation approach with feature adapters and pixel loss.

Result: AnomalyVFM achieves 94.1% AUROC across 9 datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 3.3 percentage points.

Conclusion: AnomalyVFM establishes a robust approach to leverage VFMs for zero-shot anomaly detection, surpassing previous techniques effectively.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection aims to detect and localise abnormal regions in the image without access to any in-domain training images. While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

*Shaokun Wang,Yifan Yu,Yuhang He,Weili Guan,Yihong Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IOTA, a framework combining data-driven and knowledge-based adaptation for downstream tasks, improving accuracy through interpretable prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient tuning methods underutilize pre-trained models' inherent knowledge and rely heavily on data-driven optimization, limiting their effectiveness for task adaptation.

Method: IOTA combines a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module. The White Box module extracts corrective knowledge from wrong predictions, verbalizes it into interpretable prompts, and applies a selection strategy to guide the Black Box module.

Result: IOTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 12 benchmarks for image classification under few-shot and easy-to-hard adaptation conditions.

Conclusion: Integrating corrective knowledge in the form of human-interpreted prompts enables better task adaptation, demonstrating the advantages of combining knowledge- and data-driven methods in adapting pre-trained models.

Abstract: Recently, adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks has attracted increasing interest. Previous Parameter-Efficient-Tuning (PET) methods regard the pre-trained model as an opaque Black Box model, relying purely on data-driven optimization and underutilizing their inherent prior knowledge. This oversight limits the models' potential for effective downstream task adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation. Specifically, the White Box module derives corrective knowledge by contrasting the wrong predictions with the right cognition. This knowledge is verbalized into interpretable human prompts and leveraged through a corrective knowledge-guided prompt selection strategy to guide the Black Box module toward more accurate predictions. By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation. Experimental results on 12 image classification benchmarks under few-shot and easy-to-hard adaptation settings demonstrate the effectiveness of corrective knowledge and the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

*Haoran Wei,Yaofeng Sun,Yukun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeepSeek-OCR 2, which uses a new encoder, DeepEncoder V2, to dynamically reorder visual tokens in a 2D image for enhanced understanding by vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of conventional vision-language models (VLMs) that use a rigid raster-scan order to process visual tokens, which is inconsistent with human visual perception's flexible, semantically coherent scanning mechanisms.

Method: DeepEncoder V2 is designed for causal reasoning. It intelligently reorders visual tokens of images based on semantics, specifically with a structure inspired by human cognitive processes, before feeding them to language models.

Result: The proposed approach introduces a 2D image understanding paradigm through two sequential 1D causal reasoning steps, potentially enabling more accurate image content interpretation.

Conclusion: This novel architecture demonstrates the feasibility of achieving genuine 2D reasoning for complex image layouts, taking inspiration from human visual perception. Codes and weights are shared for reproducibility.

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR 2 to investigate the feasibility of a novel encoder-DeepEncoder V2-capable of dynamically reordering visual tokens upon image semantics. Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to tackle major hindrances in the practical deployment of diffusion-based Neural Video Compression, such as information loss, inference latency, and poor temporal consistency.

Method: The authors propose an efficient model architecture, temporal consistency enhancements, and a decoding pipeline with asynchronous and parallel processing to refine performance.

Result: DiffVC-RT achieves 80.1% bitrate savings in LPIPS over VTM-17.0 on HEVC datasets with real-time speeds of 206 fps (encoding) / 30 fps (decoding) for 720p videos.

Conclusion: DiffVC-RT marks a milestone in real-time diffusion-based video compression by providing significant bitrate savings and improved performance without compromising consistency.

Abstract: The practical deployment of diffusion-based Neural Video Compression (NVC) faces critical challenges, including severe information loss, prohibitive inference latency, and poor temporal consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose DiffVC-RT, the first framework designed to achieve real-time diffusion-based perceptual NVC. First, we introduce an Efficient and Informative Model Architecture. Through strategic module replacements and pruning, this architecture significantly reduces computational complexity while mitigating structural information loss. Second, to address generative flickering artifacts, we propose Explicit and Implicit Consistency Modeling. We enhance temporal consistency by explicitly incorporating a zero-cost Online Temporal Shift Module within the U-Net, complemented by hybrid implicit consistency constraints. Finally, we present an Asynchronous and Parallel Decoding Pipeline incorporating Mixed Half Precision, which enables asynchronous latent decoding and parallel frame reconstruction via a Batch-dimension Temporal Shift design. Experiments show that DiffVC-RT achieves 80.1% bitrate savings in terms of LPIPS over VTM-17.0 on HEVC dataset with real-time encoding and decoding speeds of 206 / 30 fps for 720p videos on an NVIDIA H800 GPU, marking a significant milestone in diffusion-based video compression.

*Shaokun Wang,Weili Guan,Jizhou Han,Jianlong Wu,Yupeng Hu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'StructAlign', a method to address feature drift and catastrophic forgetting in Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR). It uses geometric alignment and cross-modal relation preservation, achieving improved performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTVR faces challenges of catastrophic forgetting and feature drift while maintaining accurate text-video alignment as new semantic categories are learned incrementally.

Method: The paper introduces 'StructAlign', which employs Equiangular Tight Frame geometry for geometric alignment and cross-modal loss functions to maintain modality alignment and suppress intra-modal drift.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in CTVR, showing better alignment and stability across multimodal features.

Conclusion: By tackling both non-cooperative feature drift and intra-modal drift, StructAlign provides a systematic solution for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in CTVR tasks, enhancing performance.

Abstract: Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) is a challenging multimodal continual learning setting, where models must incrementally learn new semantic categories while maintaining accurate text-video alignment for previously learned ones, thus making it particularly prone to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art continual retrieval approaches.

TL;DR: The paper investigates person re-identification (ReID) using supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned training paradigms and finds language-aligned models to be more robust for cross-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of generalization in person re-identification and explore the role of foundation models in improving performance across diverse domains.

Method: The study evaluates 11 models across 9 datasets with three training paradigms: supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned, specifically analyzing cross-domain robustness.

Result: Supervised models excel within their training domains but fail in cross-domain scenarios. Language-aligned models demonstrate impressive cross-domain robustness without explicit training for ReID.

Conclusion: Language-aligned models hold potential for solving cross-domain ReID challenges, highlighting limitations in supervised models and merits in broader, transferable representations.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) remains a challenging problem in computer vision. This work reviews various training paradigm and evaluates the robustness of state-of-the-art ReID models in cross-domain applications and examines the role of foundation models in improving generalization through richer, more transferable visual representations. We compare three training paradigms, supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned models. Through the study the aim is to answer the following questions: Can supervised models generalize in cross-domain scenarios? How does foundation models like SigLIP2 perform for the ReID tasks? What are the weaknesses of current supervised and foundational models for ReID? We have conducted the analysis across 11 models and 9 datasets. Our results show a clear split: supervised models dominate their training domain but crumble on cross-domain data. Language-aligned models, however, show surprising robustness cross-domain for ReID tasks, even though they are not explicitly trained to do so.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLEAR-Mamba, a framework for medical image classification that improves generalization and prediction reliability in ophthalmic angiography applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations in modality-specific medical image classification, such as single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, which impact generalization and reliability.

Method: CLEAR-Mamba employs enhanced architecture and training strategies, including HaC hypernetwork-based layers for adaptability, and RaP scheme for reliability-aware predictions, alongside constructing a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset.

Result: Experimental evaluations reveal that CLEAR-Mamba outperforms baseline models, including MedMamba, in multi-disease classification tasks with improved prediction reliability.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective solution for reliable and generalizable medical image classification in ophthalmic practices, addressing challenges posed by modality-specific attributes and inter-device variability.

Abstract: Medical image classification is a core task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), playing a pivotal role in early disease detection, treatment planning, and patient prognosis assessment. In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction. This study provides an effective solution that balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image classification tasks.

*Shuguang Zhang,Junhong Lian,Guoxin Yu,Baoxun Xu,Xiang Ao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet) for improved multimodal sarcasm detection, using fact-grounded captions generated by Multimodal LLMs to address semantic gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in multimodal sarcasm detection, especially when modalities are loosely related or semantically indirect, and to minimize noise from subjective LLM-generated cues.

Method: GDCNet utilizes descriptive, factual image captions generated by MLLMs as semantic anchors. It computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies across modalities and fuses features adaptively through a gated module.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance and robustness on multimodal sarcasm detection benchmarks, setting a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.

Conclusion: GDCNet improves the detection of cross-modal semantic incongruities by leveraging stable and factually grounded anchors, enhancing accuracy and robustness for multimodal sarcasm detection.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within image-text pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OS-Marathon, a benchmark dataset of 242 long, repetitive tasks, and proposes a cost-effective few-shot demonstration method for workflow teaching in Computer-Use Agents (CUAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a structured evaluation benchmark for assessing the capabilities of CUAs in completing long-horizon, repetitive workflows.

Method: The researchers developed OS-Marathon, a benchmark of 242 tasks across two domains, and utilized a few-shot demonstration approach to teach CUAs the logic of repetitive workflows.

Result: Extensive experiments revealed the inherent difficulty of the provided tasks and validated the method's effectiveness in enabling CUAs to perform workflows on unseen, large data collections.

Conclusion: The OS-Marathon benchmark and the proposed demonstration technique enhance evaluation and teaching of CUAs, making them viable for long, structured workflows.

Abstract: Long-horizon, repetitive workflows are common in professional settings, such as processing expense reports from receipts and entering student grades from exam papers. These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the inherent challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of our proposed method. Project website: https://os-marathon.github.io/.

*Diogo J. Paulo,Hugo Proença,João C. Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a region-aware frequency-based strategy to improve face morphing attack detection in cross-dataset scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face morphing attacks pose challenges to face recognition systems, particularly in single-image detection scenarios without trusted references.

Method: Develops a method leveraging residual frequency domain modeling alongside Markov Random Field for combining evidence from facial regions.

Result: Achieves competitive error rates: 1.85% EER on FRLL-Morph and second rank on MAD22 with 6.12% EER, using spectral features.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight approach offers a viable alternative to deep learning models, enhancing morph detection in complex settings.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks present a significant threat to face recognition systems used in electronic identity enrolment and border control, particularly in single-image morphing attack detection (S-MAD) scenarios where no trusted reference is available. In spite of the vast amount of research on this problem, morph detection systems struggle in cross-dataset scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce a region-aware frequency-based morph detection strategy that drastically improves over strong baseline methods in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings using a lightweight approach. Having observed the separability of bona fide and morph samples in the frequency domain of different facial parts, our approach 1) introduces the concept of residual frequency domain, where the frequency of the signal is decoupled from the natural spectral decay to easily discriminate between morph and bona fide data; 2) additionally, we reason in a global and local manner by combining the evidence from different facial regions in a Markov Random Field, which infers a globally consistent decision. The proposed method, trained exclusively on the synthetic morphing attack detection development dataset (SMDD), is evaluated in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings on FRLL-Morph and MAD22 sets. Our approach achieves an average equal error rate (EER) of 1.85\% on FRLL-Morph and ranks second on MAD22 with an average EER of 6.12\%, while also obtaining a good bona fide presentation classification error rate (BPCER) at a low attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) using only spectral features. These findings indicate that Fourier-domain residual modeling with structured regional fusion offers a competitive alternative to deep S-MAD architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ProSkill, a new benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural videos, addressing gaps in research related to complex procedural activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of datasets and comprehensive methods for skill assessment in procedural tasks, as most prior research focuses on limited actions or domains like sports.

Method: ProSkill employs a new annotation protocol based on a Swiss Tournament scheme for pairwise comparisons, aggregated into global scores using an ELO-based system, allowing for absolute and pairwise skill assessments.

Result: The ProSkill dataset highlights deficiencies in current state-of-the-art algorithms for skill assessment in procedural videos, emphasizing the challenges in this domain.

Conclusion: ProSkill provides a valuable tool for advancing research in skill assessment, offering both data and a benchmarking framework to improve evaluation methods for procedural tasks.

Abstract: Skill assessment in procedural videos is crucial for the objective evaluation of human performance in settings such as manufacturing and procedural daily tasks. Current research on skill assessment has predominantly focused on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for complex procedural activities. Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiMoRS, a bi-modal prompt learning framework for adapting vision-language models to remote sensing tasks, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenges in transferring prompt learning methods to remote sensing imagery, including multi-label scenes, high variability, and spatial diversity.

Method: BiMoRS uses a frozen image captioning model to extract textual summaries from remote sensing images, fuses the textual and visual features, and employs a cross-attention module to create contextualized prompts without modifying the CLIP backbone.

Result: BiMoRS performs consistently better than strong baselines, achieving up to a 2% higher performance on average across four remote sensing datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively adapts vision-language models to remote sensing tasks, overcoming unique challenges and highlighting its significance in domain generalization scenarios.

Abstract: Prompt learning (PL) has emerged as an effective strategy to adapt vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for downstream tasks under limited supervision. While PL has demonstrated strong generalization on natural image datasets, its transferability to remote sensing (RS) imagery remains underexplored. RS data present unique challenges, including multi-label scenes, high intra-class variability, and diverse spatial resolutions, that hinder the direct applicability of existing PL methods. In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose BiMoRS, a lightweight bi-modal prompt learning framework tailored for RS tasks. BiMoRS employs a frozen image captioning model (e.g., BLIP-2) to extract textual semantic summaries from RS images. These captions are tokenized using a BERT tokenizer and fused with high-level visual features from the CLIP encoder. A lightweight cross-attention module then conditions a learnable query prompt on the fused textual-visual representation, yielding contextualized prompts without altering the CLIP backbone. We evaluate BiMoRS on four RS datasets across three domain generalization (DG) tasks and observe consistent performance gains, outperforming strong baselines by up to 2% on average.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LEAF, a label-efficient framework for image quality assessment (IQA) that reduces human annotation requirements by distilling perceptual quality insights from a large language model teacher into a lightweight student regressor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost and dependence on extensive Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations for adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to image quality assessment (IQA) tasks needed improvement.

Method: LEAF employs a teacher-student framework where the MLLM teacher provides quality perception priors via point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, which are distilled into a lightweight student regressor calibrated on a small subset of MOS annotations.

Result: LEAF minimizes the reliance on substantial human supervision for IQA tasks while maintaining strong correlations with MOS, showcasing its effectiveness through experiments on diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical and efficient solution for IQA by balancing minimal annotation requirements with robust quality assessment capabilities.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in image quality assessment (IQA) tasks. However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations. Experiments on both user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations, making lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the current lack of evaluation methods for MLLMs on long-form, temporally-structured, and knowledge-intensive educational content.

Method: Introduce LEMON, a benchmark comprising 2,277 STEM lecture video segments and 4,181 QA pairs, designed to test cross-modal integration and reasoning capabilities across various tasks.

Result: Experiments show that state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with temporal reasoning and instructional prediction, revealing significant performance gaps.

Conclusion: LEMON offers a challenging benchmark to advance multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities in educational contexts.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress across vision, audio, and language tasks, yet their performance on long-form, knowledge-intensive, and temporally structured educational content remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LEMON, a Lecture-based Evaluation benchmark for MultimOdal uNderstanding, focusing on STEM lecture videos that require long-horizon reasoning and cross-modal integration. LEMON comprises 2,277 video segments spanning 5 disciplines and 29 courses, with an average duration of 196.1 seconds, yielding 4,181 high-quality QA pairs, including 3,413 multiple-choice and 768 open-ended questions. Distinct from existing video benchmarks, LEMON features: (1) semantic richness and disciplinary density, (2) tightly coupled video-audio-text modalities, (3) explicit temporal and pedagogical structure, and (4) contextually linked multi-turn questioning. It further encompasses six major tasks and twelve subtasks, covering the full cognitive spectrum from perception to reasoning and then to generation. Comprehensive experiments reveal substantial performance gaps across tasks, highlighting that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle with temporal reasoning and instructional prediction. We expect LEMON to serve as an extensible and challenging benchmark for advancing multimodal perception, reasoning, and generation in long-form instructional contents.

Result: The unified framework reveals a potential for enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, and proposes a vision for standardizing next-generation visual compression techniques.

Conclusion: Standardizing and unifying token technologies for intelligent tasks, akin to traditional codecs like H.264/265, can achieve high efficiency and performance in a broad range of AI applications.

Abstract: "Compression Tells Intelligence", is supported by research in artificial intelligence, particularly concerning (multimodal) large language models (LLMs/MLLMs), where compression efficiency often correlates with improved model performance and capabilities. For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.

*Haonan Zhong,Wei Song,Tingxu Han,Maurice Pagnucco,Jingling Xue,Yang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairT2V, a training-free framework for reducing gender bias in text-to-video (T2V) models without finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the unexplored issue of demographic, specifically gender, bias in T2V diffusion models, which impacts fairness and accuracy in video generation.

Method: FairT2V neutralizes bias in prompt embeddings using anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations and applies this selectively during early identity-forming stages to preserve semantic integrity and temporal coherence.

Result: The proposed framework significantly reduces gender bias in video generation while maintaining high video quality, as shown in experiments on the Open-Sora T2V model.

Conclusion: FairT2V offers an efficient and effective approach for mitigating demographic bias in T2V models, ensuring fairer outputs without compromising video quality.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have achieved rapid progress, yet their demographic biases, particularly gender bias, remain largely unexplored. We present FairT2V, a training-free debiasing framework for text-to-video generation that mitigates encoder-induced bias without finetuning. We first analyze demographic bias in T2V models and show that it primarily originates from pretrained text encoders, which encode implicit gender associations even for neutral prompts. We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.
  Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule. We further propose a video-level fairness evaluation protocol combining VideoLLM-based reasoning with human verification. Experiments on the modern T2V model Open-Sora show that FairT2V substantially reduces demographic bias across occupations with minimal impact on video quality.

*Jie Liu,Yu Sun,Alpar Cseke,Yao Feng,Nicolas Heron,Michael J. Black,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FunHSI, a framework to generate functionality-aware 3D human-scene interactions based on task prompts, addressing limitations of current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating plausible and functionally correct 3D human interactions within scenes, while other methods struggle with the semantics of object functionality and human-scene contact.

Method: FunHSI uses functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements through task prompts, reconstruct their geometry, and design a contact graph. It employs vision-language models for synthesizing interaction tasks and refines 3D body configurations for physical and functional correctness.

Result: FunHSI generates functionally accurate and physically plausible 3D human-scene interactions across a variety of scenes, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates the ability to create functionally realistic 3D human-scene interactions, aiding applications in robotics, AI, and content creation.

Abstract: Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as "sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., "increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal framework using images and inertial measurements for road surface classification, addressing limitations of current benchmarks and introducing a novel dataset, ROAD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current road surface classification methods fail due to limited sensing modalities and environmentally homogeneous datasets.

Method: Proposes a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module combined with an adaptive gating layer and introduces the ROAD dataset, which includes real-world, vision-only, and synthetic subsets.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements (+1.4 pp on PVS benchmark and +11.6 pp on ROAD subset) and robust behavior under challenging visual conditions.

Conclusion: The framework is affordable, scalable, and robust, enabling better road surface understanding in regions with environmental diversity and cost constraints.

Abstract: Road surface classification (RSC) is a key enabler for environment-aware predictive maintenance systems. However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.

TL;DR: FreeFix enhances novel view synthesis by leveraging pretrained image diffusion models for 2D-3D refinement, avoiding fine-tuning, and achieving improved rendering for extrapolated views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novel view synthesis advanced by Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with dense input dependence and degraded extrapolated views. Generative models like diffusion models hold potential but face limitations in balancing generalization and fidelity.

Method: FreeFix employs fine-tuning-free methods utilizing pretrained image diffusion models, combined with an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, and introduces a per-pixel confidence mask for targeted improvement.

Result: The approach improves extrapolated rendering and ensures multi-frame consistency. FreeFix delivers generalization comparable to fine-tuning-based methods with enhanced fidelity across experiments.

Conclusion: FreeFix successfully addresses the trade-off between fidelity and generalization in novel view synthesis, demonstrating its efficacy without requiring fine-tuning, and pushing advancements in this field.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have advanced novel view synthesis, yet still rely on dense inputs and often degrade at extrapolated views. Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement. Experiments across multiple datasets show that FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods, while retaining strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: Discontinuous DLS is an efficient solution for compressing large-scale scientific data in high-performance computing environments, offering robust compression-to-error ratios and maintaining scientific data fidelity.

Abstract: The growing volume of scientific simulation data presents a significant challenge for storage and transfer. Error-bounded lossy compression has emerged as a critical solution for mitigating these challenges, providing a means to reduce data size while ensuring that reconstructed data remains valid for scientific analysis. In this paper, we present a data-driven scientific data compressor, called Discontinuous Data-informed Local Subspaces (Discontinuous DLS), to improve compression-to-error ratios over data-agnostic compressors. This error-bounded compressor leverages localized spatial and temporal subspaces, informed by the underlying data structure, to enhance compression efficiency and preserve key features. The presented technique is flexible and applicable to a wide range of scientific data, including fluid dynamics, environmental simulations, and other high-dimensional, time-dependent datasets. We describe the core principles of the method and demonstrate its ability to significantly reduce storage requirements without compromising critical data fidelity. The technique is implemented in a distributed computing environment using MPI, and its performance is evaluated against state-of-the-art error-bounded compression methods in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy. This study highlights discontinuous DLS as a promising approach for large-scale scientific data compression in high-performance computing environments, providing a robust solution for managing the growing data demands of modern scientific simulations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreamFusion to optimize Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for efficient high-quality image and video generation using topology-aware enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies related to high latency and large activation sizes during single-GPU inference for high-resolution images and longer videos.

Method: StreamFusion introduces innovations like topology-aware sequence parallelism, Torus Attention, and one-sided communication for better inter- and intra-machine operations.

Result: Experiments show StreamFusion achieves an average performance improvement of 1.35× and up to 1.77× over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: StreamFusion effectively addresses limitations of existing SP techniques and enhances DiT serving efficiency for scalable inference across GPUs.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained increasing adoption in high-quality image and video generation. As demand for higher-resolution images and longer videos increases, single-GPU inference becomes inefficient due to increased latency and large activation sizes. Current frameworks employ sequence parallelism (SP) techniques such as Ulysses Attention and Ring Attention to scale inference. However, these implementations have three primary limitations: (1) suboptimal communication patterns for network topologies on modern GPU machines, (2) latency bottlenecks from all-to-all operations in inter-machine communication, and (3) GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads from using two-sided communication libraries. To address these issues, we present StreamFusion, a topology-aware efficient DiT serving engine. StreamFusion incorporates three key innovations: (1) a topology-aware sequence parallelism technique that accounts for inter- and intra-machine bandwidth differences, (2) Torus Attention, a novel SP technique enabling overlapping of inter-machine all-to-all operations with computation, and (3) a one-sided communication implementation that minimizes GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads. Our experiments demonstrate that StreamFusion outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by an average of $1.35\times$ (up to $1.77\times$).

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SuperInfer enhances large language model inference by addressing GPU memory constraints and latency issues, utilizing Superchips with NVLink-C2C for improved responsiveness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a challenge in meeting latency service level objectives for LLM serving while dealing with limited GPU memory capacities and handling high request rates.

Method: SuperInfer incorporates RotaSched, a proactive SLO-aware scheduler, and DuplexKV, an optimized transfer engine enabling full-duplex NVLink-C2C connectivity on Superchips.

Result: SuperInfer significantly improves TTFT SLO attainment rates by up to 74.7% compared to existing systems and maintains competitive throughput and performance.

Conclusion: SLO-aware scheduling and memory co-design effectively harness the capabilities of Superchips to address latency and memory constraints in LLM serving.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) serving faces a fundamental tension between stringent latency Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and limited GPU memory capacity. When high request rates exhaust the KV cache budget, existing LLM inference systems often suffer severe head-of-line (HOL) blocking. While prior work explored PCIe-based offloading, these approaches cannot sustain responsiveness under high request rates, often failing to meet tight Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) SLOs. We present SuperInfer, a high-performance LLM inference system designed for emerging Superchips (e.g., NVIDIA GH200) with tightly coupled GPU-CPU architecture via NVLink-C2C. SuperInfer introduces RotaSched, the first proactive, SLO-aware rotary scheduler that rotates requests to maintain responsiveness on Superchips, and DuplexKV, an optimized rotation engine that enables full-duplex transfer over NVLink-C2C. Evaluations on GH200 using various models and datasets show that SuperInfer improves TTFT SLO attainment rates by up to 74.7% while maintaining comparable TBT and throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating that SLO-aware scheduling and memory co-design unlocks the full potential of Superchips for responsive LLM serving.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified classification framework for identifying contention types in high-dimensional systems, combining representation transformation, graph-based structural modeling, and task decoupling, achieving better performance on contention recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the problem of identifying multi-task contention types in complex, high-dimensional system environments to improve performance management in computing systems.

Method: The approach integrates system state representation, nonlinear feature extraction, graph-based structural modeling, task-specific mapping, and adaptive multi-task loss weighting to classify contention types more accurately.

Result: The framework demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 on a public system trace dataset, showing stability and applicability through sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion: The study concludes that structured representations and multi-task classifications effectively improve contention pattern recognition in computing environments, presenting a robust approach for performance management.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of accurately identifying multi-task contention types in high-dimensional system environments and proposes a unified contention classification framework that integrates representation transformation, structural modeling, and a task decoupling mechanism. The method first constructs system state representations from high-dimensional metric sequences, applies nonlinear transformations to extract cross-dimensional dynamic features, and integrates multiple source information such as resource utilization, scheduling behavior, and task load variations within a shared representation space. It then introduces a graph-based modeling mechanism to capture latent dependencies among metrics, allowing the model to learn competitive propagation patterns and structural interference across resource links. On this basis, task-specific mapping structures are designed to model the differences among contention types and enhance the classifier's ability to distinguish multiple contention patterns. To achieve stable performance, the method employs an adaptive multi-task loss weighting strategy that balances shared feature learning with task-specific feature extraction and generates final contention predictions through a standardized inference process. Experiments conducted on a public system trace dataset demonstrate advantages in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1, and sensitivity analyses on batch size, training sample scale, and metric dimensionality further confirm the model's stability and applicability. The study shows that structured representations and multi-task classification based on high-dimensional metrics can significantly improve contention pattern recognition and offer a reliable technical approach for performance management in complex computing environments.

*Aleix Roca,Vicenç Beltran*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel User-space Scheduling Framework (USF) to optimize process scheduling in oversubscribed parallel applications, reducing performance interference and achieving up to 2.4x efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of HPC and AI, traditional OS schedulers struggle with scheduling stress caused by oversubscribed complex parallel workloads. This necessitates an alternative solution to mitigate performance degradation.

Method: The authors designed USF, implemented entirely in user-space, allowing users to define custom scheduling algorithms. It includes a default cooperative policy (SCHED_COOP) that minimizes interference by switching threads only when blocking. The implementation was integrated with the GNU C library and nOS-V runtime.

Result: USF and SCHED_COOP demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving up to 2.4x gains in scenarios with oversubscribed workloads, particularly in nested BLAS, PyTorch inference, and Molecular Dynamics applications.

Conclusion: USF proves to be an effective, non-invasive framework for optimizing process scheduling in oversubscribed scenarios, mitigating issues like lock contention, and enhancing parallel workload performance.

Abstract: The convergence of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the emergence of increasingly complex parallel applications and workloads. These workloads often combine multiple parallel runtimes within the same application or across co-located jobs, creating scheduling demands that place significant stress on traditional OS schedulers. When oversubscribed (there are more ready threads than cores), OS schedulers rely on periodic preemptions to multiplex cores, often introducing interference that may degrade performance. In this paper, we present: (1) The User-space Scheduling Framework (USF), a novel seamless process scheduling framework completely implemented in user-space. USF enables users to implement their own process scheduling algorithms without requiring special permissions. We evaluate USF with its default cooperative policy, (2) SCHED_COOP, designed to reduce interference by switching threads only upon blocking. This approach mitigates well-known issues such as Lock-Holder Preemption (LHP), Lock-Waiter Preemption (LWP), and scalability collapse. We implement USF and SCHED_COOP by extending the GNU C library with the nOS-V runtime, enabling seamless coordination across multiple runtimes (e.g., OpenMP) without requiring invasive application changes. Evaluations show gains up to 2.4x in oversubscribed multi-process scenarios, including nested BLAS workloads, multi-process PyTorch inference with LLaMA-3, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoOverlap, a compiler and runtime to improve GPU workload communication by enabling fine-grained overlap inside a single fused kernel for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the communication bottleneck in large-scale GPU workloads caused by coarse-grained overlapping methods, which result in inefficiencies such as extra kernel launches and device-wide synchronizations.

Method: AutoOverlap uses a communication chunk abstraction to decouple communication granularity, enabling chunk-level plans that can be ported or customized. It aligns computation with chunk availability by transforming local Triton kernels according to a chunk schedule.

Result: AutoOverlap demonstrates an average speedup of 1.3× and up to 4.7× in multi-GPU workloads, showing its ability to significantly enhance performance.

Conclusion: The proposed AutoOverlap approach provides an effective solution for improving communication and computation overlap at a fine granularity, reducing inefficiencies in distributed GPU workloads.

Abstract: Communication has become a first-order bottleneck in large-cale GPU workloads, and existing distributed compilers address it mainly by overlapping whole compute and communication kernels at the stream level. This coarse granularity incurs extra kernel launches, forces device-wide synchronizations at kernel boundaries, and leaves substantial slack when the slowest tile or kernel stretches the communication tail. We present AutoOverlap, a compiler and runtime that enables automatic fine-grained overlap inside a single fused kernel. AutoOverlap introduces a communication chunk abstraction that decouples communication granularity from kernel structure and backend mechanisms, allowing chunk-level plans to be ported from existing distributed compilers, written directly by users, or instantiated from reusable templates. Given a local Triton kernel and a chunk schedule, AutoOverlap performs transformations to align computation with chunk availability. Implemented as a source-to-source compiler on Triton, AutoOverlap delivers an average end-to-end speedup of 1.3$\times$ and up to 4.7$\times$ on multi-GPU workloads.

*Saeed Akbar,Muhammad Waqas,Rahmat Ullah*

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic Fog (AF), a decentralized fog computing model that outperforms traditional approaches in latency reduction and adaptability under dynamic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fog and edge computing solutions face challenges such as partial observability, high latency, and dynamic workloads, which are not adequately addressed by existing Agentic AI models due to computational and analytical limitations.

Method: The authors propose the Agentic Fog (AF) model, where fog nodes act as policy-driven autonomous agents that coordinate via p2p shared memory interactions. They formalize coordination as an exact potential game for stability and convergence.

Result: Simulations show that the AF system achieves better latency performance and adapts to changing demands more efficiently than traditional methods like greedy heuristics and integer linear programming.

Conclusion: AF's decentralized and adaptive approach ensures stability, lower latency, and robustness under varying conditions, making it a viable solution for fog and edge computing challenges.

Abstract: Fog and edge computing require adaptive control schemes that can handle partial observability, severe latency requirements, and dynamically changing workloads. Recent research on Agentic AI (AAI) increasingly integrates reasoning systems powered by Large Language Models; however, these tools are not applicable to infrastructure-level systems due to their high computational cost, stochastic nature, and poor formal analyzability. In this paper, a generic model, Agentic Fog (AF), is presented, in which fog nodes are represented as policy-driven autonomous agents that communicate via p2p interactions based on shared memory and localized coordination. The suggested architecture decomposes a system's goals into abstract policy guidance and formalizes decentralized fog coordination as an exact potential game. The framework is guaranteed to converge and remain stable under asynchronous updates, bounded-rational best-response dynamics, and node failures. Simulations demonstrate that the AF system achieves lower average latency and adapts more efficiently to varying demand than greedy heuristics and integer linear programming under dynamic conditions. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates the capability to perform optimally under different memory and coordination conditions.

*Minseo Kwak,Jaehyung Kim*

TL;DR: Gap-K% offers a novel approach to detect pretraining data in LLMs by leveraging the log probability gap and sliding window strategy, showing superior results in privacy detection benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about pretraining data privacy and copyright issues in LLMs by improving detection capabilities.

Method: Introduced Gap-K%, using the log probability gap between the top-1 prediction and target tokens, enhanced with a sliding window approach to analyze local correlations.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in detecting pretraining data on WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks, outperforming previous methods across model sizes and input lengths.

Conclusion: Gap-K% is an effective and advanced method for addressing critical privacy and copyright concerns in LLM pretraining corpora.

Abstract: The opacity of massive pretraining corpora in Large Language Models (LLMs) raises significant privacy and copyright concerns, making pretraining data detection a critical challenge. Existing state-of-the-art methods typically rely on token likelihoods, yet they often overlook the divergence from the model's top-1 prediction and local correlation between adjacent tokens. In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations. Extensive experiments on the WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.

*Adnan Ahmad,Chiara Boldrini,Lorenzo Valerio,Andrea Passarella,Marco Conti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel aggregation approach for Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) to address heterogeneity in data and model initialization, improving generalization and reducing communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFL faces challenges due to variations in individual device data and interaction levels, causing slower convergence in global models.

Method: A new aggregation technique is introduced using consensus weights derived from second-order information of local models for robust parameter-level aggregation.

Result: Experiments on computer vision tasks demonstrate improved model generalization and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: The approach effectively tackles heterogeneity in DFL, ensuring faster convergence and efficient communication, making collaboration more robust and scalable.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is a serverless collaborative machine learning paradigm where devices collaborate directly with neighbouring devices to exchange model information for learning a generalized model. However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs.

*Yuhao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Competition alone enables emergent specialization in populations of learners, validated across diverse real-world domains using the NichePopulation algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how learners can develop coordinated, diverse behaviors without explicit communication or diversity incentives.

Method: Proposed the NichePopulation algorithm combining competitive exclusion and niche affinity tracking, validated across six real-world domains.

Result: Achieved significant specialization (SI = 0.75) with learners showing genuine emergent behaviors and outperforming various baselines.

Conclusion: Competition drives emergent specialization, enhancing performance and establishing diverse, effective populations.

Abstract: How can populations of learners develop coordinated, diverse behaviors without explicit communication or diversity incentives? We demonstrate that competition alone is sufficient to induce emergent specialization -- learners spontaneously partition into specialists for different environmental regimes through competitive dynamics, consistent with ecological niche theory. We introduce the NichePopulation algorithm, a simple mechanism combining competitive exclusion with niche affinity tracking. Validated across six real-world domains (cryptocurrency trading, commodity prices, weather forecasting, solar irradiance, urban traffic, and air quality), our approach achieves a mean Specialization Index of 0.75 with effect sizes of Cohen's d > 20. Key findings: (1) At lambda=0 (no niche bonus), learners still achieve SI > 0.30, proving specialization is genuinely emergent; (2) Diverse populations outperform homogeneous baselines by +26.5% through method-level division of labor; (3) Our approach outperforms MARL baselines (QMIX, MAPPO, IQL) by 4.3x while being 4x faster.

*Hyunmin Kim,Yukun Zhou,Rahul A. Jonas,Lie Ju,Sunjin Hwang,Pearse A. Keane,Siegfried K. Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Oculomix, a new hierarchical sampling strategy for data augmentation to predict systemic diseases using retinal imaging, improving patient-specific characteristics' preservation compared to existing methods like CutMix and MixUp.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current augmentation methods like CutMix and MixUp fail to retain patient-specific attributes for retinal image analysis, which is crucial for predicting diseases effectively.

Method: Oculomix uses clinically guided sampling strategies based on hierarchical patient and exam levels to constrain the mixing space, preserving critical attributes by leveraging temporal trends and within-sample consistency.

Result: Oculomix outperformed image-level augmentations such as CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC for predicting major cardiovascular events over five years on a diverse population dataset.

Conclusion: Introducing hierarchical sampling strategies significantly enhances model performance in oculomics, proving Oculomix's capability to better capture patient-specific characteristics compared to traditional augmentation techniques.

Abstract: Oculomics - the concept of predicting systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and dementia, through retinal imaging - has advanced rapidly due to the data efficiency of transformer-based foundation models like RETFound. Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye). We show that Oculomix consistently outperforms image-level CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC, demonstrating the necessity and value of the proposed method in oculomics.

*Tobias Habermann,Michael Mecik,Zhenyu Wang,César David Vera,Martin Kumm,Mario Garrido*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel design for continuous-flow CNN architectures on FPGAs to address data underutilization issues, achieving high hardware utilization and enabling efficient implementation of complex CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the inefficiency in hardware utilization caused by data reduction in CNN layers when implemented on fully parallel FPGA architectures.

Method: The authors analyze CNN data flow and propose interleaving low data-rate signals, sharing hardware units, and using suitable parallelization for high-throughput CNN implementation.

Result: The proposed approach showed significant savings in arithmetic logic, enabling the implementation of complex CNNs like MobileNet on a single FPGA with high throughput.

Conclusion: The novel data-rate-aware approach ensures close to 100% hardware utilization, improving efficiency and enabling complex CNN deployments on FPGAs while maintaining high throughput.

Abstract: Among hardware accelerators for deep-learning inference, data flow implementations offer low latency and high throughput capabilities. In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation. The results show that a significant amount of the arithmetic logic can be saved, which allows implementing complex CNNs like MobileNet on a single FPGA with high throughput.

*Faruk Alpay,Bugra Kilictas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies multi-step reasoning in Transformer models using geometric and statistical tools, revealing a critical phase transition and the emergence of structured concepts in representation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of reasoning in Transformer language models through a theoretical framework and identify key mechanisms that enable multi-step reasoning.

Method: Geometry and statistical-physics approaches are used to analyze the layerwise covariance spectra and effective dimensionality of hidden states in Transformer models across scales.

Result: The findings show a phase transition in large models, accompanied by reduced effective dimensionality, spectral changes, and the emergence of transient object-like structures in the model's representation space.

Conclusion: The paper explains the appearance of stable reasoning patterns in large models and how it corresponds to structural changes in internal representations, offering insights into multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: We study the emergence of multi-step reasoning in deep Transformer language models through a geometric and statistical-physics lens. Treating the hidden-state trajectory as a flow on an implicit Riemannian manifold, we analyze the layerwise covariance spectrum of activations, where $C^{(\ell)}=\mathbb{E}[h^{(\ell)}h^{(\ell)\top}]$, and track deviations from a random-matrix bulk. Across model scales (1.5B--30B), we observe a sharp reduction in effective dimensionality consistent with a phase transition: an order parameter based on sparsity/localization, $Ω(h)=1-\|h\|_1/(\sqrt{d}\|h\|_2)$, exhibits a discontinuity near a critical normalized depth $γ_c\approx 0.42$ in sufficiently large models. We formalize the forward pass as a discrete coarse-graining map and relate the appearance of stable "concept basins" to fixed points of this renormalization-like dynamics. The resulting low-entropy regime is characterized by a spectral tail collapse and by the formation of transient, reusable object-like structures in representation space, which we call Transient Class Objects (TCOs). We provide theoretical conditions connecting logical separability to spectral decay and validate the predicted signatures with layerwise probes on multiple open-weight model families.

*Valery Manokhin,Daniel Grønhaug*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores post-hoc calibration methods for probabilistic predictions in binary classification, emphasizing conformal and Venn-based approaches. It benchmarks 21 classifiers and evaluates calibration methods' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve probabilistic predictions in binary classification, particularly focusing on calibration methods with distribution-free validity guarantees like conformal and Venn-based techniques.

Method: Using the TabArena-v0.1 suite, the researchers perform randomized, stratified five-fold cross-validation and evaluate five calibration methods (Isotonic regression, Platt scaling, Beta calibration, Venn-Abers predictors, and Pearsonify) applied to test predictions.

Result: Venn-Abers predictors offer the best average reduction in log-loss, followed by Beta calibration. Platt scaling shows inconsistent effects, and conventional methods like isotonic regression can degrade scoring performance. Overall, calibration effects depend on datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: No single calibration method uniformly outperforms the others. While calibration can slightly increase accuracy across models, the impact is often marginal, with most calibration techniques showing nuanced benefits and downsides.

Abstract: We study model-agnostic post-hoc calibration methods intended to improve probabilistic predictions in supervised binary classification on real i.i.d. tabular data, with particular emphasis on conformal and Venn-based approaches that provide distribution-free validity guarantees under exchangeability. We benchmark 21 widely used classifiers, including linear models, SVMs, tree ensembles (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM), and modern tabular neural and foundation models, on binary tasks from the TabArena-v0.1 suite using randomized, stratified five-fold cross-validation with a held-out test fold. Five calibrators; Isotonic regression, Platt scaling, Beta calibration, Venn-Abers predictors, and Pearsonify are trained on a separate calibration split and applied to test predictions. Calibration is evaluated using proper scoring rules (log-loss and Brier score) and diagnostic measures (Spiegelhalter's Z, ECE, and ECI), alongside discrimination (AUC-ROC) and standard classification metrics. Across tasks and architectures, Venn-Abers predictors achieve the largest average reductions in log-loss, followed closely by Beta calibration, while Platt scaling exhibits weaker and less consistent effects. Beta calibration improves log-loss most frequently across tasks, whereas Venn-Abers displays fewer instances of extreme degradation and slightly more instances of extreme improvement. Importantly, we find that commonly used calibration procedures, most notably Platt scaling and isotonic regression, can systematically degrade proper scoring performance for strong modern tabular models. Overall classification performance is often preserved, but calibration effects vary substantially across datasets and architectures, and no method dominates uniformly. In expectation, all methods except Pearsonify slightly increase accuracy, but the effect is marginal, with the largest expected gain about 0.008%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between loss landscape flatness and label noise, proposing Noise-Compensated Sharpness-aware Minimization (NCSAM) to improve robustness and performance in noisy label settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of learning from noisy labels in real-world datasets, which often contain corrupted annotations, by understanding how label noise interacts with the loss landscape.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the relationship between loss landscape flatness and label noise, using this insight to propose NCSAM. This approach leverages Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) perturbation to mitigate label noise effects.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that NCSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently in noisy label scenarios, while maintaining robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed method, NCSAM, effectively enhances performance in the presence of label noise, and the theoretical insights provide a new perspective in tackling noisy labels in deep learning.

Abstract: Learning from Noisy Labels (LNL) presents a fundamental challenge in deep learning, as real-world datasets often contain erroneous or corrupted annotations, \textit{e.g.}, data crawled from Web. Current research focuses on sophisticated label correction mechanisms. In contrast, this paper adopts a novel perspective by establishing a theoretical analysis the relationship between flatness of the loss landscape and the presence of label noise. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that carefully simulated label noise synergistically enhances both the generalization performance and robustness of label noises. Consequently, we propose Noise-Compensated Sharpness-aware Minimization (NCSAM) to leverage the perturbation of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to remedy the damage of label noises. Our analysis reveals that the testing accuracy exhibits a similar behavior that has been observed on the noise-clear dataset. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches on diverse tasks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a probabilistic sensing paradigm inspired by the autonomous nervous system to achieve energy-efficient data acquisition without information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of achieving energy efficiency in sensor data-acquisition processes while reducing the risk of losing critical information due to deterministic sampling methods.

Method: The approach involves a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) integrated with an analog feature extraction circuit to make sampling decisions probabilistically and autonomously, ensuring real-time responsiveness.

Result: Validation experiments on seismic survey data showed lossless data acquisition with less than 0.41% normalized mean squared error and 93% savings in system operation time and data samples generated.

Conclusion: The proposed sensing paradigm enables intelligent data-sampling decisions, achieving significant energy efficiency and accuracy in real-time applications.

Abstract: Extending the intelligence of sensors to the data-acquisition process - deciding whether to sample or not - can result in transformative energy-efficiency gains. However, making such a decision in a deterministic manner involves risk of losing information. Here we present a sensing paradigm that enables making such a decision in a probabilistic manner. The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit. The response time of the system is on the order of microseconds, over-coming the sub-sampling-rate response time limit and enabling real-time intelligent autonomous activation of data-sampling. Validation experiments on active seismic survey data demonstrate lossless probabilistic data acquisition, with a normalized mean squared error of 0.41%, and 93% saving in the active operation time of the system and the number of generated samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeanCache is a framework for faster and better Flow Matching inference by reducing computation errors through average-velocity caching and stability-driven scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and error accumulation in existing caching methods during Flow Matching inference, especially under high acceleration influences.

Method: Introduces a caching framework based on average-velocity construction using Jacobian--vector products, combined with a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy to optimize timing and reuse.

Result: Achieved acceleration rates of 4.12X, 4.56X, and 3.59X in specific experimental settings while surpassing existing baselines in generation quality.

Conclusion: MeanCache offers a novel perspective and practical solution to improve efficiency and stability in Flow Matching inference, and it encourages new advancements in generative model acceleration.

Abstract: We present MeanCache, a training-free caching framework for efficient Flow Matching inference. Existing caching methods reduce redundant computation but typically rely on instantaneous velocity information (e.g., feature caching), which often leads to severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality. We believe this simple yet effective approach provides a new perspective for Flow Matching inference and will inspire further exploration of stability-driven acceleration in commercial-scale generative models.

*Canyang Zhao,Bolin Peng,J. Patrick Mayo,Ce Ju,Bing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses cross-session nonstationarity in neural activity for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA), which significantly improves decoding performance across sessions with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of cross-session nonstationarity in neural activity for BCIs, which hinders the generalization of decoders across sessions, especially when data from new sessions is scarce.

Method: The authors propose TCLA, a framework leveraging an autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional neural representation from a source session and then align the target session's representation in a task-conditioned manner for effective neural decoding.

Result: Using the macaque motor and oculomotor dataset, TCLA shows superior decoding performance over baseline methods, achieving significant improvements (e.g., up to 0.386 gain in y-coordinate velocity decoding for motor data).

Conclusion: TCLA enables robust cross-session neural decoding, effectively transferring knowledge between sessions even when target session data is limited, making it a promising strategy for improving BCIs.

Abstract: Cross-session nonstationarity in neural activity recorded by implanted electrodes is a major challenge for invasive Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as decoders trained on data from one session often fail to generalize to subsequent sessions. This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.

TL;DR: This paper highlights NetCVR as a superior metric for industrial recommender systems compared to traditional CVR, introduces the CASCADE dataset for NetCVR prediction, and proposes TESLA framework to enhance NetCVR modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVR does not account for refund behavior, limiting its ability to capture true user satisfaction and business value in industrial recommender systems.

Method: They introduce the CASCADE dataset with insights into temporal dynamics, cascaded modeling, and delay time importance. They also propose the TESLA framework featuring CVR-refund cascaded architecture, debiasing, and delay-time-aware ranking loss.

Result: TESLA significantly improves NetCVR prediction performance, showing 12.41% and 14.94% absolute improvements in RI-AUC and RI-PRAUC, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NetCVR prediction requires advanced approaches like TESLA for better capturing user satisfaction and business value. The CASCADE dataset establishes a foundation for continuous NetCVR modeling research.

Abstract: In industrial recommender systems, conversion rate (CVR) is widely used for traffic allocation, but it fails to fully reflect recommendation effectiveness because it ignores refund behavior. To better capture true user satisfaction and business value, net conversion rate (NetCVR), defined as the probability that a clicked item is purchased and not refunded, has been proposed.Unlike CVR, NetCVR prediction involves a more complex multi-stage cascaded delayed feedback process. The two cascaded delays from click to conversion and from conversion to refund have opposite effects, making traditional CVR modeling methods inapplicable. Moreover, the lack of open-source datasets and online continuous training schemes further hinders progress in this area.To address these challenges, we introduce CASCADE (Cascaded Sequences of Conversion and Delayed Refund), the first large-scale open dataset derived from the Taobao app for online continuous NetCVR prediction. Through an in-depth analysis of CASCADE, we identify three key insights: (1) NetCVR exhibits strong temporal dynamics, necessitating online continuous modeling; (2) cascaded modeling of CVR and refund rate outperforms direct NetCVR modeling; and (3) delay time, which correlates with both CVR and refund rate, is an important feature for NetCVR prediction.Based on these insights, we propose TESLA, a continuous NetCVR modeling framework featuring a CVR-refund-rate cascaded architecture, stage-wise debiasing, and a delay-time-aware ranking loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TESLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CASCADE, achieving absolute improvements of 12.41 percent in RI-AUC and 14.94 percent in RI-PRAUC on NetCVR prediction. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/alimama-tech/NetCVR.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL) to efficiently generate unlearnable examples using linear models, reducing computational costs without compromising effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the concern of unauthorized data usage in training deep models by creating unlearnable examples with minimal computational costs.

Method: PIL leverages linear surrogate models to induce imperceptible perturbations, making data unlearnable while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Result: PIL achieves comparable or better performance than deep model-based methods while dramatically cutting down on computational time.

Conclusion: PIL offers a practical and efficient approach for safeguarding data against unauthorized use and provides new insights into unlearnable example mechanisms.

Abstract: Collecting web data to train deep models has become increasingly common, raising concerns about unauthorized data usage. To mitigate this issue, unlearnable examples introduce imperceptible perturbations into data, preventing models from learning effectively. However, existing methods typically rely on deep neural networks as surrogate models for perturbation generation, resulting in significant computational costs. In this work, we propose Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), a computationally efficient yet effective method that generates perturbations using only linear surrogate models. PIL achieves comparable or better performance than existing surrogate-based methods while reducing computational time dramatically. We further reveal a key mechanism underlying unlearnable examples: inducing linearization to deep models, which explains why PIL can achieve competitive results in a very short time. Beyond this, we provide an analysis about the property of unlearnable examples under percentage-based partial perturbation. Our work not only provides a practical approach for data protection but also offers insights into what makes unlearnable examples effective.

TL;DR: BayPrAnoMeta proposes a Bayesian method for few-shot industrial image anomaly detection, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting anomalies in industrial images is difficult due to extreme class imbalance and limited labeled defective samples, especially in few-shot scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces BayPrAnoMeta, which uses probabilistic normality models with a Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior for improved anomaly detection, and extends it to federated meta-learning.

Result: BayPrAnoMeta achieves higher AUROC scores compared to MAML, Proto-MAML, and PatchCore methods on the MVTec AD benchmark.

Conclusion: This research showcases the effectiveness of Bayesian generalization in handling few-shot industrial image anomaly detection, providing improved robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Industrial image anomaly detection is a challenging problem owing to extreme class imbalance and the scarcity of labeled defective samples, particularly in few-shot settings. We propose BayPrAnoMeta, a Bayesian generalization of Proto-MAML for few-shot industrial image anomaly detection. Unlike existing Proto-MAML approaches that rely on deterministic class prototypes and distance-based adaptation, BayPrAnoMeta replaces prototypes with task-specific probabilistic normality models and performs inner-loop adaptation via a Bayesian posterior predictive likelihood. We model normal support embeddings with a Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW) prior, producing a Student-$t$ predictive distribution that enables uncertainty-aware, heavy-tailed anomaly scoring and is essential for robustness in extreme few-shot settings. We further extend BayPrAnoMeta to a federated meta-learning framework with supervised contrastive regularization for heterogeneous industrial clients and prove convergence to stationary points of the resulting nonconvex objective. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate consistent and significant AUROC improvements over MAML, Proto-MAML, and PatchCore-based methods in few-shot anomaly detection settings.

*Chiraag Kaushik,Davis Barch,Andrea Fanelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of adapting sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to multimodal embeddings, proposing a new approach to improve multimodal alignment and feature interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SAEs struggle with multimodal embeddings, often creating split dictionaries where features are unimodal, limiting their usefulness for multimodal tasks.

Method: The authors introduce a new SAE-based method utilizing cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization to improve multimodal dictionary alignment.

Result: Their approach learns a more multimodal dictionary, reduces dead neurons, and enhances feature semanticity for embeddings like CLIP (image/text) and CLAP (audio/text).

Conclusion: The proposed method improves multimodal alignment, enabling better interpretability and control in cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: The Linear Representation Hypothesis asserts that the embeddings learned by neural networks can be understood as linear combinations of features corresponding to high-level concepts. Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn "split dictionaries", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.

*Yan Zhang,Xuefeng Liu,Sipeng Chen,Sascha Ranftl,Chong Liu,Shibo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAMBO, a method using a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Processes for Bayesian Optimization, addressing multi-regime challenges in varied domains like drug discovery and molecular conformer optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Bayesian Optimization struggles with non-uniform smoothness in multi-regime problems, leading to miscalibrated uncertainty and inefficiencies in areas like molecular conformation and drug discovery.

Method: RAMBO employs Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Processes, collapsed Gibbs sampling for latent regime inference, adaptive scheduling of concentration parameters, and tailored acquisition functions to handle multi-regime objectives.

Result: Experiments show RAMBO's superior performance on synthetic and real-world applications compared to state-of-the-art baselines in tasks like molecular optimization and fusion reactor design.

Conclusion: RAMBO improves Bayesian Optimization in multi-regime problems, enabling better handling of heterogeneous domains through dynamic regime discovery and precise modeling.

Abstract: Standard Bayesian Optimization (BO) assumes uniform smoothness across the search space an assumption violated in multi-regime problems such as molecular conformation search through distinct energy basins or drug discovery across heterogeneous molecular scaffolds. A single GP either oversmooths sharp transitions or hallucinates noise in smooth regions, yielding miscalibrated uncertainty. We propose RAMBO, a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Processes that automatically discovers latent regimes during optimization, each modeled by an independent GP with locally-optimized hyperparameters. We derive collapsed Gibbs sampling that analytically marginalizes latent functions for efficient inference, and introduce adaptive concentration parameter scheduling for coarse-to-fine regime discovery. Our acquisition functions decompose uncertainty into intra-regime and inter-regime components. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, including molecular conformer optimization, virtual screening for drug discovery, and fusion reactor design, demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on multi-regime objectives.

*Fang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Structural Compositional Function Networks (StructuralCFN), enhancing the performance and interpretability of neural networks for tabular data by incorporating a Relation-Aware Inductive Bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of traditional deep learning architectures in handling tabular data, particularly their inability to exploit manifold structural dependencies and their lack of interpretability in high-stakes domains.

Method: StructuralCFN models each tabular feature as a composition of others using Differentiable Adaptive Gating, which self-discovers optimal activation mechanisms. It also integrates domain-specific relational priors to guide learning and interpretation.

Result: The method shows statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on 18 benchmarks, particularly excelling on scientific and clinical datasets. It efficiently provides both high performance and symbolic interpretability.

Conclusion: StructuralCFN outperforms standard models in tabular data analysis with greater interpretability and a compact design, recovering mathematical relationships in the data while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of tabular data in high-stakes domains, traditional deep learning architectures often struggle to match the performance of gradient-boosted decision trees while maintaining scientific interpretability. Standard neural networks typically treat features as independent entities, failing to exploit the inherent manifold structural dependencies that define tabular distributions. We propose Structural Compositional Function Networks (StructuralCFN), a novel architecture that imposes a Relation-Aware Inductive Bias via a differentiable structural prior. StructuralCFN explicitly models each feature as a mathematical composition of its counterparts through Differentiable Adaptive Gating, which automatically discovers the optimal activation physics (e.g., attention-style filtering vs. inhibitory polarity) for each relationship. Our framework enables Structured Knowledge Integration, allowing domain-specific relational priors to be injected directly into the architecture to guide discovery. We evaluate StructuralCFN across a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation suite on 18 benchmarks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific and clinical datasets (e.g., Blood Transfusion, Ozone, WDBC). Furthermore, StructuralCFN provides Intrinsic Symbolic Interpretability: it recovers the governing "laws" of the data manifold as human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (300--2,500 parameters) that is over an order of magnitude (10x--20x) smaller than standard deep baselines.

### [210] [SA-PEF: Step-Ahead Partial Error Feedback for Efficient Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20738)
*Dawit Kiros Redie,Reza Arablouei,Stefan Werner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of error feedback (EF) in federated learning with non-IID data by proposing step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), achieving faster convergence and balancing short-term acceleration with long-term stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the slow residual error decay and gradient mismatch in error feedback (EF) under non-IID data in federated learning, which hampers progress in the early training rounds.

Method: The paper introduces step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF) that combines step-ahead correction with partial error feedback. Theoretical analysis ensures convergence to stationarity and derives residual contraction bounds under heterogeneous data.

Result: SA-PEF consistently achieves accelerated convergence, outpacing traditional EF in experiments with diverse architectures and datasets, while maintaining the long-term stability needed for federated learning.

Conclusion: SA-PEF effectively balances rapid progress and stability in federated learning by optimizing the step-ahead coefficient, making it more efficient for non-IID data scenarios.

Abstract: Biased gradient compression with error feedback (EF) reduces communication in federated learning (FL), but under non-IID data, the residual error can decay slowly, causing gradient mismatch and stalled progress in the early rounds. We propose step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), which integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF). SA-PEF recovers EF when the step-ahead coefficient $α=0$ and step-ahead EF (SAEF) when $α=1$. For non-convex objectives and $δ$-contractive compressors, we establish a second-moment bound and a residual recursion that guarantee convergence to stationarity under heterogeneous data and partial client participation. The resulting rates match standard non-convex Fed-SGD guarantees up to constant factors, achieving $O((η,η_0TR)^{-1})$ convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor with a fixed inner step size. Our analysis reveals a step-ahead-controlled residual contraction $ρ_r$ that explains the observed acceleration in the early training phase. To balance SAEF's rapid warm-up with EF's long-term stability, we select $α$ near its theory-predicted optimum. Experiments across diverse architectures and datasets show that SA-PEF consistently reaches target accuracy faster than EF.

*Shih-Hsuan Chiu,Ming-Syan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TONEL, a framework enhancing RAG deployment on edge devices by improving noise resilience and domain adaptability using task-specific embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge device deployment for personalized assistants powered by RAG faces challenges due to noise and growing data demands, particularly in dynamic, multi-domain scenarios.

Method: TONEL utilizes a noise-aware projection model to adapt embeddings to CiM hardware and maintain retrieval accuracy under noisy conditions.

Result: Experiments on personalization benchmarks show TONEL's effectiveness in task-specific noisy environments, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: TONEL successfully addresses noise and adaptability challenges in edge-based RAG systems, demonstrating its practicality in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Personalized virtual assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) on edge devices are attracting growing attention, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a key method for personalization by retrieving relevant profile data and generating tailored responses. However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on personalization benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods relative to strong baselines, especially in task-specific noisy scenarios.

*Hari Krishna Sahoo,Mudit Gaur,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces rectified flow models and demonstrates their theoretical and empirical efficiency superiority, achieving faster sampling and better sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in generative models by constraining transport trajectories, allowing faster sampling and improving theoretical guarantees.

Method: The study utilizes rectified flows with linear transport trajectories, analyzes sample complexity using localized Rademacher complexity, and compares it to existing generative models.

Result: Rectified flow models achieve sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$, outperforming previous bounds and exhibiting order-optimal efficiency.

Conclusion: Rectified flows provide significant theoretical and practical advancements in generative model efficiency, supported by analytical justification for their empirical success.

Abstract: Recently, flow-based generative models have shown superior efficiency compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we study rectified flow models, which constrain transport trajectories to be linear from the base distribution to the data distribution. This structural restriction greatly accelerates sampling, often enabling high-quality generation with a single Euler step. Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study developed a visit-level 180-day mortality risk model for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) using longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts (n=526 and n=640). Using GRU and RSF models, it achieved high predictive accuracy and external validation results, leveraging routine clinical markers like BMI and blood pressure for risk estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the need for accurate mortality prediction models in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) to enable proactive care and tailored treatment due to the disease’s aggressive nature and heterogeneous response to treatment.

Method: The researchers used longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts (n=526 and n=640) and evaluated five model architectures: GRU, LSTM, Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest, and Logistic Regression. They employed sensitivity thresholds and focused on external validation. The GRU model was highlighted for its calibration and accuracy in predicting 180-day mortality.

Result: The GRU model outperformed others, achieving excellent discrimination (PR-AUC: 0.87, calibration slope: 0.93). Clinical marker analysis identified BMI and systolic blood pressure as key predictors. It demonstrated clinical utility by providing actionable early warnings with a median time-in-warning of 151 days for true positives.

Conclusion: Longitudinal clinical markers can reliably predict short-term mortality risks in mCRPC, aiding in multi-month proactive care planning. The GRU model proved particularly effective, offering high accuracy and practical clinical relevance.

Abstract: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a highly aggressive disease with poor prognosis and heterogeneous treatment response. In this work, we developed and externally validated a visit-level 180-day mortality risk model using longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts (n=526 and n=640). Only visits with observable 180-day outcomes were labeled; right-censored cases were excluded from analysis. We compared five candidate architectures: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Logistic Regression. For each dataset, we selected the smallest risk-threshold that achieved an 85% sensitivity floor. The GRU and RSF models showed high discrimination capabilities initially (C-index: 87% for both). In external validation, the GRU obtained a higher calibration (slope: 0.93; intercept: 0.07) and achieved an PR-AUC of 0.87. Clinical impact analysis showed a median time-in-warning of 151.0 days for true positives (59.0 days for false positives) and 18.3 alerts per 100 patient-visits. Given late-stage frailty or cachexia and hemodynamic instability, permutation importance ranked BMI and systolic blood pressure as the strongest associations. These results suggest that longitudinal routine clinical markers can estimate short-horizon mortality risk in mCRPC and support proactive care planning over a multi-month window.

*Chi-Yao Huang,Khoa Vo,Aayush Atul Verma,Duo Lu,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Domain Expansion," a method to prevent conflicting gradients in multi-objective learning by restructuring the latent space with orthogonal pooling mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of conflicting gradients in multi-objective tasks, which leads to latent representation collapse and suboptimal shared representations.

Method: A framework called Domain Expansion is proposed, using an orthogonal pooling mechanism to assign each task to a mutually orthogonal subspace in the latent space.

Result: Validated through benchmarks (ShapeNet, MPIIGaze, Rotated MNIST) showing prevention of latent representation collapse and enabling an interpretable and compositional latent space.

Conclusion: Domain Expansion successfully creates a structured latent space, resolving gradient conflicts, improving multi-objective performance, and enabling explicit concept manipulation.

Abstract: Training a single network with multiple objectives often leads to conflicting gradients that degrade shared representations, forcing them into a compromised state that is suboptimal for any single task--a problem we term latent representation collapse. We introduce Domain Expansion, a framework that prevents these conflicts by restructuring the latent space itself. Our framework uses a novel orthogonal pooling mechanism to construct a latent space where each objective is assigned to a mutually orthogonal subspace. We validate our approach across diverse benchmarks--including ShapeNet, MPIIGaze, and Rotated MNIST--on challenging multi-objective problems combining classification with pose and gaze estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that this structure not only prevents collapse but also yields an explicit, interpretable, and compositional latent space where concepts can be directly manipulated.

*Baptiste Debes,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Distributional Sobolev Training, a reinforcement learning approach addressing existing limitations in stochastic or noisy environments by modeling distributions over value functions and their gradients in continuous state-action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MAGE face challenges in stochastic or noisy environments, making them less applicable. The motivation is to extend reinforcement learning techniques to handle these challenges effectively while improving sample efficiency.

Method: The approach focuses on Distributional Sobolev Training, which models distributions over state-action value functions and their gradients. It uses techniques like Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE), and Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD). This framework introduces a Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator, proven to be a contraction with a unique fixed point.

Result: The method demonstrates improved performance and robustness in a stochastic reinforcement learning toy problem as well as benchmarks on MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: Distributional Sobolev Training offers an effective framework for handling stochastic and noisy environments in reinforcement learning. Its contraction properties and gradient-aware modeling enhance both performance and the stability of learned policies.

Abstract: Gradient-regularized value learning methods improve sample efficiency by leveraging learned models of transition dynamics and rewards to estimate return gradients. However, existing approaches, such as MAGE, struggle in stochastic or noisy environments, limiting their applicability. In this work, we address these limitations by extending distributional reinforcement learning on continuous state-action spaces to model not only the distribution over scalar state-action value functions but also over their gradients. We refer to this approach as Distributional Sobolev Training. Inspired by Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), our method utilizes a one-step world model of reward and transition distributions implemented via a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). The proposed framework is sample-based and employs Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD) to instantiate the distributional Bellman operator. We prove that the Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator is a contraction with a unique fixed point, and highlight a fundamental smoothness trade-off underlying contraction in gradient-aware RL. To validate our method, we first showcase its effectiveness on a simple stochastic reinforcement learning toy problem, then benchmark its performance on several MuJoCo environments.

*Anna van Elst,Igor Colin,Stephan Clémençon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AsylADMM, a gossip algorithm for decentralized median/quantile estimation, with features like low memory use, robustness, and asynchronous updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized algorithms struggle with balancing communication efficiency, robustness to data corruption, and memory limitations on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: A novel gossip-based algorithm, AsylADMM, is proposed for decentralized median/quantile estimations, using two variables per node. A theoretical analysis of a synchronous version and empirical validation of the asynchronous version were performed.

Result: AsylADMM achieves fast convergence and enables robust methods (e.g., quantile-based trimming). Quantile-based approach outperforms rank-based alternatives.

Conclusion: AsylADMM effectively addresses decentralized learning requirements, particularly for edge devices, balancing robustness, efficiency, and memory usage.

Abstract: Specifications for decentralized learning on resource-constrained edge devices require algorithms that are communication-efficient, robust to data corruption, and lightweight in memory usage. While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods. Finally, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of rank-based trimming via Markov chain theory.

*Paul Seurin,Dean Price*

TL;DR: This paper presents an optimization framework for Heat-Pipe Microreactors, extending prior work to a multi-objective approach using the PEARL algorithm to minimize both cost and performance factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to optimize compact and transportable nuclear power systems for deployment in remote areas, addressing the challenge of reducing reliance on expensive fossil fuels.

Method: The paper utilizes a multi-objective optimization framework based on the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL). It evaluates multiple cost scenarios while ensuring safety and operational constraints are met.

Result: The study identified strategies to reduce costs and improve reactor performance, such as decreasing reliance on costly components and enhancing fuel burnup, while highlighting discrepancies in surrogate model predictions.

Conclusion: PEARL enables effective trade-off analysis in reactor design, but further progress is needed in surrogate model accuracy and constraint relaxation.

Abstract: Heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs) are compact and transportable nuclear power systems exhibiting inherent safety, well-suited for deployment in remote regions where access is limited and reliance on costly fossil fuels is prevalent. In prior work, we developed a design optimization framework that incorporates techno-economic considerations through surrogate modeling and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, focusing solely on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by using a bottom-up cost estimation approach. In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{Δh}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{Δh}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup. While PEARL demonstrates promise in navigating trade-offs across diverse design scenarios, discrepancies between surrogate model predictions and full-order simulations remain. Further improvements are anticipated through constraint relaxation and surrogate development, constituting an ongoing area of investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of recovering accuracy in NVFP4-quantized models given the challenges posed by multi-stage post-training pipelines and data limitations.

Method: QAD distills a full-precision teacher model into a quantized student model using KL divergence loss.

Result: QAD consistently recovers the accuracy to near-BF16 levels for various post-trained large language and vision-language models.

Conclusion: QAD provides an effective, stable, and robust solution to reclaim accuracy in quantized models, overcoming traditional training instability and data quality challenges.

Abstract: This technical report presents quantization-aware distillation (QAD) and our best practices for recovering accuracy of NVFP4-quantized large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). QAD distills a full-precision teacher model into a quantized student model using a KL divergence loss. While applying distillation to quantized models is not a new idea, we observe key advantages of QAD for today's LLMs: 1. It shows remarkable effectiveness and stability for models trained through multi-stage post-training pipelines, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and model merging, where traditional quantization-aware training (QAT) suffers from engineering complexity and training instability; 2. It is robust to data quality and coverage, enabling accuracy recovery without full training data. We evaluate QAD across multiple post-trained models including AceReason Nemotron, Nemotron 3 Nano, Nemotron Nano V2, Nemotron Nano V2 VL (VLM), and Llama Nemotron Super v1, showing consistent recovery to near-BF16 accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Decision Importance Transformer (DIT) framework to address in-context reinforcement learning with suboptimal offline datasets, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models are known for their in-context learning capabilities, but their application in reinforcement learning using suboptimal datasets remains challenging and underexplored.

Method: The authors propose the Decision Importance Transformer (DIT), which emulates an actor-critic algorithm in-context. A transformer-based value function estimates advantage functions, and a policy is trained via weighted MLE loss, prioritizing optimal decisions.

Result: DIT demonstrates strong performance in experiments across bandit and Markov Decision Process problems, especially with suboptimal historical data.

Conclusion: DIT successfully adapts in-context learning to improve reinforcement learning outcomes with suboptimal offline datasets, making it a promising direction for future RL policy design.

Abstract: Transformer models have achieved remarkable empirical successes, largely due to their in-context learning capabilities. Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems. Our results show that DIT achieves superior performance, particularly when the offline dataset contains suboptimal historical data.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning with physics-constrained design principles offers a scalable and efficient framework for Polar code design, advancing its suitability for 6G standardization.

Abstract: To advance Polar code design for 6G applications, we develop a reinforcement learning-based universal sequence design framework that is extensible and adaptable to diverse channel conditions and decoding strategies. Crucially, our method scales to code lengths up to $2048$, making it suitable for use in standardization. Across all $(N,K)$ configurations supported in 5G, our approach achieves competitive performance relative to the NR sequence adopted in 5G and yields up to a 0.2 dB gain over the beta-expansion baseline at $N=2048$. We further highlight the key elements that enabled learning at scale: (i) incorporation of physical law constrained learning grounded in the universal partial order property of Polar codes, (ii) exploitation of the weak long term influence of decisions to limit lookahead evaluation, and (iii) joint multi-configuration optimization to increase learning efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper highlights a reimplementation of Facebook Prophet using PyMC to explore Bayesian inference flexibility and enhance custom modeling capabilities beyond Prophet's tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of Facebook Prophet, which lacks flexibility in applying alternative inference techniques and in accommodating custom modeling ideas.

Method: The study reimplements Prophet in PyMC to extend the base model, introducing alternative Bayesian inference techniques including MCMC, MAP estimation, and Variational inference.

Result: The implementation demonstrated a more flexible framework, allowing usage of diverse Bayesian inference techniques and providing insights into forecasting metrics, convergence diagnostics, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The PyMC-based Prophet implementation overcomes the rigidity of the original model, though issues like computational efficiency still require improvement in future work.

Abstract: Since its introduction, Facebook Prophet has attracted positive attention from both classical statisticians and the Bayesian statistics community. The model provides two built-in inference methods: maximum a posteriori estimation using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). While exploring various time-series forecasting problems using Bayesian inference with Prophet, we encountered limitations stemming from the inability to apply alternative inference techniques beyond those provided by default. Additionally, the fluent API design of Facebook Prophet proved insufficiently flexible for implementing our custom modeling ideas. To address these shortcomings, we developed a complete reimplementation of the Prophet model in PyMC, which enables us to extend the base model and evaluate and compare multiple Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we present our PyMC-based implementation and analyze in detail the implementation of different Bayesian inference techniques. We consider full MCMC techniques, MAP estimation and Variational inference techniques on a time-series forecasting problem. We discuss in details the sampling approach, convergence diagnostics, forecasting metrics as well as their computational efficiency and detect possible issues which will be addressed in our future work.

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities of Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and introduces a method (SAMA) to exploit this susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored privacy vulnerabilities in DLMs, which inherently permit increased attack opportunities compared to autoregressive models.

Method: The paper proposes SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which uses progressive density sampling and sign-based statistics for robust aggregation to detect sparse memorization leaks in DLMs.

Result: Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over baselines, with better performance at low false positive rates.

Conclusion: DLMs are significantly more vulnerable to MIA than previously recognized, necessitating focused privacy-defense strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) represent a promising alternative to autoregressive language models, using bidirectional masked token prediction. Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling and generating MEG data across varying datasets and scanners using long-prevailing contexts.

Method: A SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a token stream, and a Qwen2.5-VL backbone is trained to recursively predict and generate MEG data over long contexts.

Result: The model demonstrates long-horizon generation stability, generalizes across datasets, and outperforms swapped controls in continuation accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach allows stable and neurophysiologically accurate MEG generation, paving the way for scalable and generalized modeling in this domain.

Abstract: We present a large autoregressive model for source-space MEG that scales next-token prediction to long context across datasets and scanners: handling a corpus of over 500 hours and thousands of sessions across the three largest MEG datasets. A modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream on which we train a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch to predict the next brain token and to recursively generate minutes of MEG from up to a minute of context. To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce three task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls. Code available at: https://github.com/ricsinaruto/brain-gen.

### [224] [Spectral Ghost in Representation Learning: from Component Analysis to Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20154)
*Bo Dai,Na Li,Dale Schuurmans*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of a unified understanding in self-supervised learning (SSL), proposing a framework founded on the spectral representation perspective to guide efficient and principled algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding, unclear principles for algorithm design, and challenges in practical SSL application use due to the growing variety of SSL approaches without a unified framework.

Method: The authors introduce a spectral representation perspective to theoretically analyze SSL methods, aiming to develop a unified framework for representation learning.

Result: The study reveals the spectral essence underlying existing SSL algorithms and creates a pathway for efficient and principled development of SSL methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only unifies the understanding of diverse SSL approaches but also motivates the creation of improved, practical algorithms for real-world applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) have improved empirical performance by unleashing the power of unlabeled data for practical applications. Specifically, SSL extracts the representation from massive unlabeled data, which will be transferred to a plenty of down streaming tasks with limited data. The significant improvement on diverse applications of representation learning has attracted increasing attention, resulting in a variety of dramatically different self-supervised learning objectives for representation extraction, with an assortment of learning procedures, but the lack of a clear and unified understanding. Such an absence hampers the ongoing development of representation learning, leaving a theoretical understanding missing, principles for efficient algorithm design unclear, and the use of representation learning methods in practice unjustified. The urgency for a unified framework is further motivated by the rapid growth in representation learning methods. In this paper, we are therefore compelled to develop a principled foundation of representation learning. We first theoretically investigate the sufficiency of the representation from a spectral representation view, which reveals the spectral essence of the existing successful SSL algorithms and paves the path to a unified framework for understanding and analysis. Such a framework work also inspires the development of more efficient and easy-to-use representation learning algorithms with principled way in real-world applications.

### [225] [HE-SNR: Uncovering Latent Logic via Entropy for Guiding Mid-Training on SWE-BENCH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20255)
*Yueyang Wang,Jiawei Fu,Baolong Bi,Xili Wang,Xiaoqing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HE-SNR, a new formulation for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering tasks, addressing flaws in conventional metrics like Perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in benchmarking LLMs for software engineering (SWE) tasks, traditional metrics like PPL are insufficient for mid-training guidance due to issues like 'Long-Context Tax.'

Method: The authors utilize a data filtering approach and propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, which improves metric precision via fine-grained entropy analysis, resulting in the HE-SNR metric.

Result: The HE-SNR metric demonstrates high robustness and predictive accuracy, validated through experiments on industry-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs with extended context windows (32K/128K).

Conclusion: The work establishes a theoretical and computational framework to better guide the mid-training phase of LLMs, unlocking their software engineering task potential.

Abstract: SWE-bench has emerged as the premier benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on complex software engineering tasks. While these capabilities are fundamentally acquired during the mid-training phase and subsequently elicited during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), there remains a critical deficit in metrics capable of guiding mid-training effectively. Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the "Long-Context Tax" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by first introducing a rigorous data filtering strategy. Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders ("reasonable hesitation"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Validated on industrial-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models across varying context windows (32K/128K), our approach demonstrates superior robustness and predictive power. This work provides both the theoretical foundation and practical tools for optimizing the latent potential of LLMs in complex engineering domains.

*Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,My Duong,Ying Mao,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PASS, a scalable clustering framework that uses pairwise ML and CL constraints to simplify and improve clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in scalability and performance of current methods for clustering with ML and CL constraints, particularly in specialized domains like quantum clustering.

Method: PASS combines ML pseudo-points and two selection strategies: a constraint-aware margin rule and an information-geometric rule using Fisher-Rao distance for subset selection.

Result: PASS achieves competitive clustering performance (SSE) with lower computational costs and improved effectiveness where prior techniques struggle.

Conclusion: PASS is a promising approach for efficient and accurate pairwise-constrained clustering, extending applicability to challenging and niche use cases.

Abstract: Pairwise-constrained clustering augments unsupervised partitioning with side information by enforcing must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraints between specific samples, yielding labelings that respect known affinities and separations. However, ML and CL constraints add an extra layer of complexity to the clustering problem, with current methods struggling in data scalability, especially in niche applications like quantum or quantum-hybrid clustering. We propose PASS, a pairwise-constraints and ambiguity-driven subset selection framework that preserves ML and CL constraints satisfaction while allowing scalable, high-quality clustering solution. PASS collapses ML constraints into pseudo-points and offers two selectors: a constraint-aware margin rule that collects near-boundary points and all detected CL violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points via a Fisher-Rao distance derived from soft assignment posteriors, then selects the highest-information subset under a simple budget. Across diverse benchmarks, PASS attains competitive SSE at substantially lower cost than exact or penalty-based methods, and remains effective in regimes where prior approaches fail.

*Jim Maar,Denis Paperno,Callum Stuart McDougall,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores implicit planning in language models, identifying universal mechanisms influencing token generation and proposing simpler techniques for its analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate the implicit planning behaviors of language models, which impact their decision-making processes and could inform AI safety and control.

Method: The authors used a methodology involving token steering to manipulate rhyme schemes and answers in outputs, applying it across models and studying token preparation strategies.

Result: Findings indicate that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present even in models with as few as 1 billion parameters. The proposed techniques simplify studying and analyzing these behaviors.

Conclusion: The study highlights the presence of implicit planning across language models and introduces scalable methods to further analyze these abilities, with implications for AI development and control.

Abstract: Prior work suggests that language models, while trained on next token prediction, show implicit planning behavior: they may select the next token in preparation to a predicted future token, such as a likely rhyming word, as supported by a prior qualitative study of Claude 3.5 Haiku using a cross-layer transcoder. We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. "-ight") or answer to a question ("whale") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters. Our methodology offers a widely applicable direct way to study implicit planning abilities of LLMs. More broadly, understanding planning abilities of language models can inform decisions in AI safety and control.

### [228] [Local Duality for Sparse Support Vector Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20170)
*Penghe Zhang,Naihua Xiu,Houduo Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores sparse support vector machines (SSVMs) and their theoretical basis, establishing connections to other SVMs and explaining their empirical advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the lack of theoretical justification in deriving SSVMs from cardinality functions, such as $ll_0$-norm, and to explore their connection to convex SVMs like hSVM and rSVM.

Method: Developed a local duality theory for SSVM, proved relationships between SSVM, 0/1-loss SVM, and other SVMs, and tested empirical performance using real datasets.

Result: SSVM was shown to be the dual of the 0/1-loss SVM, and its local solutions align with hyperparameter selection and representer theorems. Empirical results validated SSVM's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SSVM has theoretical and practical advantages over convex SVMs, supported by its duality with 0/1-loss SVMs and favorable empirical performance.

Abstract: Due to the rise of cardinality minimization in optimization, sparse support vector machines (SSVMs) have attracted much attention lately and show certain empirical advantages over convex SVMs. A common way to derive an SSVM is to add a cardinality function such as $\ell_0$-norm to the dual problem of a convex SVM. However, this process lacks theoretical justification. This paper fills the gap by developing a local duality theory for such an SSVM formulation and exploring its relationship with the hinge-loss SVM (hSVM) and the ramp-loss SVM (rSVM). In particular, we prove that the derived SSVM is exactly the dual problem of the 0/1-loss SVM, and the linear representer theorem holds for their local solutions. The local solution of SSVM also provides guidelines on selecting hyperparameters of hSVM and rSVM. {Under specific conditions, we show that a sequence of global solutions of hSVM converges to a local solution of 0/1-loss SVM. Moreover, a local minimizer of 0/1-loss SVM is a local minimizer of rSVM.} This explains why a local solution induced by SSVM outperforms hSVM and rSVM in the prior empirical study. We further conduct numerical tests on real datasets and demonstrate potential advantages of SSVM by working with locally nice solutions proposed in this paper.

*James Amarel,Robyn Miller,Nicolas Hengartner,Benjamin Migliori,Emily Casleton,Alexei Skurikhin,Earl Lawrence,Gerd J. Kunde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diagnostic tool to evaluate how neural emulators handle physical symmetries in partial differential equations by analyzing parameter updates along symmetry-related states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding if neural emulators internalize physical symmetries is important for creating surrogate models that generalize well over symmetry transformations in partial differential equations.

Method: The authors developed an influence-based diagnostic to measure loss gradient coherence along group orbits, providing insight into how parameter updates propagate between symmetry-related states.

Result: The diagnostic revealed that orbit-wise gradient coherence is key for generalizing over symmetries and detecting symmetry-compatible basins in training autoregressive fluid flow emulators.

Conclusion: This technique offers a new way to assess whether surrogate models capture the symmetry properties of solution operators, enhancing their reliability and generalization.

Abstract: We study how neural emulators of partial differential equation solution operators internalize physical symmetries by introducing an influence-based diagnostic that measures the propagation of parameter updates between symmetry-related states, defined as the metric-weighted overlap of loss gradients evaluated along group orbits. This quantity probes the local geometry of the learned loss landscape and goes beyond forward-pass equivariance tests by directly assessing whether learning dynamics couple physically equivalent configurations. Applying our diagnostic to autoregressive fluid flow emulators, we show that orbit-wise gradient coherence provides the mechanism for learning to generalize over symmetry transformations and indicates when training selects a symmetry compatible basin. The result is a novel technique for evaluating if surrogate models have internalized symmetry properties of the known solution operator.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAPLE is a dimensionality reduction method that improves UMAP by better modeling manifolds using a self-supervised learning approach, enhancing visual cluster separation and subcluster resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in UMAP regarding modeling complex, high-dimensional manifolds with high intra-cluster variance, like biological or image data.

Method: MAPLE uses a self-supervised approach with maximum manifold capacity representations (MMCRs), compressing local variances and amplifying differences between dissimilar points.

Result: MAPLE achieves clearer visual cluster separations and finer subcluster resolution compared to UMAP while maintaining similar computational cost.

Conclusion: MAPLE provides improved dimensionality reduction for complex, high-dimensional data by enhancing manifold modeling and maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present a new nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, MAPLE, that enhances UMAP by improving manifold modeling. MAPLE employs a self-supervised learning approach to more efficiently encode low-dimensional manifold geometry. Central to this approach are maximum manifold capacity representations (MMCRs), which help untangle complex manifolds by compressing variances among locally similar data points while amplifying variance among dissimilar data points. This design is particularly effective for high-dimensional data with substantial intra-cluster variance and curved manifold structures, such as biological or image data. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MAPLE can produce clearer visual cluster separations and finer subcluster resolution than UMAP while maintaining comparable computational cost.

*Alexander Benanti,Xi Han,Hong Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuraLSP, a neural preconditioner for solving PDEs efficiently, achieving faster convergence rates using low-rank spectral compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and rank inflation in existing graph neural network-based methods for solving PDEs, which are crucial for science and engineering applications.

Method: The authors propose NeuraLSP, a neural preconditioner with a novel loss metric that leverages left singular subspace information to compress rank effectively and improve convergence rates.

Result: NeuraLSP demonstrates theoretical guarantees, robust empirical performance, and up to a 53% speedup in solving PDEs compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: NeuraLSP offers a significant improvement in preconditioning PDEs, effectively overcoming rank inflation issues and providing faster and more robust convergence, validated both theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) are integral for many fields across science and engineering. Such techniques usually involve solving large, sparse linear systems, where preconditioning methods are critical. In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.

*Chen Cheng,Ang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a causal framework for evaluating features' effectiveness for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization rather than relying solely on domain-invariance, achieving better performance under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of OOD generalization in real-world classification, where test distributions often differ from training data. It highlights the limitations of relying solely on domain-invariant representations that may not reliably predict outcomes.

Method: The authors propose a causal perspective to OOD classification, evaluating learned representations based on their necessity and sufficiency under distribution shifts using a segment-level framework. This framework directly measures causal effectiveness across domains.

Result: The experiments conducted on multi-domain benchmarks show consistent improvements in OOD generalization, particularly under challenging domain shifts, validating the proposed causal evaluation framework.

Conclusion: Evaluating representations using causal effectiveness criteria is more robust and faithful than relying solely on domain-invariance, leading to better OOD generalization outcomes.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in real-world classification, where test distributions often differ substantially from training data. Most existing approaches pursue domain-invariant representations, implicitly assuming that invariance implies reliability. However, features that are invariant across domains are not necessarily causally effective for prediction.
  In this work, we revisit OOD classification from a causal perspective and propose to evaluate learned representations based on their necessity and sufficiency under distribution shift. We introduce an explicit segment-level framework that directly measures causal effectiveness across domains, providing a more faithful criterion than invariance alone.
  Experiments on multi-domain benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts, highlighting the value of causal evaluation for robust generalization.

*Ioannis Anagnostides,Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas,Tuomas Sandholm,Jingming Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the complexity of performative prediction, establishing sharp phase transitions and hardness results for computing solutions in the presence of performative effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the computational complexity of solving problems in performative prediction, where deploying predictive models shifts underlying data, especially for regimes with strong performative effects. This area is crucial for real-world applications where data adapts to models.

Method: The authors employ complexity theory to analyze the task of finding performatively stable points, extending PPAD-hardness results to broader settings, and analyzing strategic classification for its complexity.

Result: The authors establish that computing performatively stable points is PPAD-complete for certain regimes, demonstrate intractability for even simple settings, and prove additional complexity results in strategic classification.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical intractability in solving performative prediction problems under strong data-shifting effects, with implications for predictive modeling and algorithm design in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Performative prediction captures the phenomenon where deploying a predictive model shifts the underlying data distribution. While simple retraining dynamics are known to converge linearly when the performative effects are weak ($ρ< 1$), the complexity in the regime $ρ> 1$ was hitherto open. In this paper, we establish a sharp phase transition: computing an $ε$-performatively stable point is PPAD-complete -- and thus polynomial-time equivalent to Nash equilibria in general-sum games -- even when $ρ= 1 + O(ε)$. This intractability persists even in the ostensibly simple setting with a quadratic loss function and linear distribution shifts. One of our key technical contributions is to extend this PPAD-hardness result to general convex domains, which is of broader interest in the complexity of variational inequalities. Finally, we address the special case of strategic classification, showing that computing a strategic local optimum is PLS-hard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a meta-cognitive reinforcement learning framework that incorporates reliability assessment and regulation to address issues in learning processes, particularly under noisy and corrupted conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the problem where robust reinforcement learning either becomes overly conservative or fails under uncertainty due to its inability to consider the reliability of its learning process.

Method: The method introduces a meta-trust variable influenced by Value Prediction Error Stability (VPES), to enable fail-safe regulation and gradual recovery of trust in learning dynamics.

Result: The experimental results on continuous-control benchmarks with corrupted rewards showed higher average returns and fewer late-stage training failures compared to existing robust methods.

Conclusion: Meta-cognitive reinforcement learning with reliability assessment can significantly enhance performance and reduce failures in noisy or corrupted environments, validating its efficacy over traditional robustness-focused approaches.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning methods typically focus on suppressing unreliable experiences or corrupted rewards, but they lack the ability to reason about the reliability of their own learning process. As a result, such methods often either overreact to noise by becoming overly conservative or fail catastrophically when uncertainty accumulates.
  In this work, we propose a meta-cognitive reinforcement learning framework that enables an agent to assess, regulate, and recover its learning behavior based on internally estimated reliability signals. The proposed method introduces a meta-trust variable driven by Value Prediction Error Stability (VPES), which modulates learning dynamics via fail-safe regulation and gradual trust recovery.
  Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks with reward corruption demonstrate that recovery-enabled meta-cognitive control achieves higher average returns and significantly reduces late-stage training failures compared to strong robustness baselines.

### [235] [DeRaDiff: Denoising Time Realignment of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20198)
*Ratnavibusena Don Shahain Manujith,Yang Zhang,Teoh Tze Tzun,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents DeRaDiff, a method to optimize regularization strength for diffusion models without expensive retraining, improving alignment and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of selecting the right regularization strength in diffusion models, as improper strength can lead to either limited alignment or "reward hacking." Current methods are computationally expensive due to the need for multiple model alignments.

Method: The proposed method, DeRaDiff, modulates regularization strength during sampling using a decoding-time realignment approach. It modifies reverse step predictions with a geometric mixture of aligned and reference distributions for efficient regularization control.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that DeRaDiff effectively approximates models trained with varying regularization strengths, consistently improving text-image alignment and image quality metrics across scenarios.

Conclusion: DeRaDiff streamlines the search for optimal regularization strength, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance across metrics. It removes the need for costly alignment processes.

Abstract: Recent advances align diffusion models with human preferences to increase aesthetic appeal and mitigate artifacts and biases. Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to "reward hacking". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithms for tasks like minimum-cost network flow can be enhanced by leveraging machine-learned predictions, offering improved performance in practical scenarios.

Method: The authors propose an augmented version of the traditional $$-relaxation algorithm, include theoretical analysis for prediction errors and PAC-learning, and validate the model empirically with traffic simulations and chip routing tasks.

Result: Empirical studies demonstrated significant speedups, with average gains of $12.74	imes$ and $1.64	imes$, depending on the application.

Conclusion: Integrating learned dual predictions within minimum-cost flow algorithms offers robust performance improvements while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that machine-learned predictions can provably improve the performance of classic algorithms. In this work, we propose the first minimum-cost network flow algorithm augmented with a dual prediction. Our method is based on a classic minimum-cost flow algorithm, namely $\varepsilon$-relaxation. We provide time complexity bounds in terms of the infinity norm prediction error, which is both consistent and robust. We also prove sample complexity bounds for PAC-learning the prediction. We empirically validate our theoretical results on two applications of minimum-cost flow, i.e., traffic networks and chip escape routing, in which we learn a fixed prediction, and a feature-based neural network model to infer the prediction, respectively. Experimental results illustrate $12.74\times$ and $1.64\times$ average speedup on two applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new parameterization for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers in neural networks to enable cheap and reliable hyperparameter tuning for scalable models. DMFT analysis justifies the parameterization with successful empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity introduced by sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers in neural networks during hyperparameter tuning and scaling large models efficiently.

Method: The authors propose a novel parameterization for MoE layers, leveraging dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) analysis for scaling model width, depth, number of experts, and hidden size. This approach emphasizes HP transfer across different-scale models.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate effective hyperparameter transfer in models ranging from 51M to over 2B parameters, including successful application of HPs identified on small models to larger-scale models.

Conclusion: The proposed parameterization and HP transfer methodology provide a cost-effective and reliable framework for tuning and scaling models with sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers have emerged as an important tool in scaling up modern neural networks by decoupling total trainable parameters from activated parameters in the forward pass for each token. However, sparse MoEs add complexity to training due to (i) new trainable parameters (router weights) that, like all other parameter groups, require hyperparameter (HP) tuning; (ii) new architecture scale dimensions (number of and size of experts) that must be chosen and potentially taken large. To make HP selection cheap and reliable, we propose a new parameterization for transformer models with MoE layers when scaling model width, depth, number of experts, and expert (hidden) size. Our parameterization is justified by a novel dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) analysis. When varying different model dimensions trained at a fixed token budget, we find empirically that our parameterization enables reliable HP transfer across models from 51M to over 2B total parameters. We further take HPs identified from sweeping small models on a short token horizon to train larger models on longer horizons and report performant model behaviors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Spark," a framework for efficient reinforcement learning in long-horizon tasks by strategically focusing on critical decision states for exploration, leading to resource efficiency and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in training large language models for long-horizon tasks under constrained resources, particularly the scarcity of high-quality exploration trajectories.

Method: The authors propose "Spark," a framework that activates branching exploration at critical decision points using the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals, reducing the need for human intervention and prioritizing sampling quality.

Result: Experiments across diverse tasks, such as embodied planning, demonstrate that Spark achieves higher success rates with reduced training samples while also generalizing well to unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: Spark improves resource efficiency and enhances the capability of large language models in long-horizon tasks by focusing computational effort on high-quality trajectories, showing robust generalization even in challenging situations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has empowered large language models to act as intelligent agents, yet training them for long-horizon tasks remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality trajectories, especially under limited resources. Existing methods typically scale up rollout sizes and indiscriminately allocate computational resources among intermediate steps. Such attempts inherently waste substantial computation budget on trivial steps while failing to guarantee sample quality. To address this, we propose \textbf{Spark} (\textbf{S}trategic \textbf{P}olicy-\textbf{A}ware explo\textbf{R}ation via \textbf{K}ey-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization. Experiments across diverse tasks (e.g., embodied planning), demonstrate that \textsc{Spark} achieves superior success rates with significantly fewer training samples, exhibiting robust generalization even in unseen scenarios.

### [239] [An Accounting Identity for Algorithmic Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20217)
*Hadi Elzayn,Jacob Goldin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an accounting identity linking accuracy and fairness in predictive models, highlighting the tradeoffs between fairness measures and expanded applications to non-binary outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to reconcile the ongoing tension between model accuracy and fairness by deriving principles that relate these critical performance indicators in predictive modeling.

Method: The authors derive an accounting identity to quantify the tradeoffs between accuracy and fairness measures, applying the identity to binary and non-binary prediction tasks. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the theory.

Result: The research demonstrates that accuracy and fairness are inherently interlinked, with improvements in one often affecting the other, and identifies how fairness interventions might redistribute fairness violations or increase unfairness budgets when accuracy is reduced.

Conclusion: Accuracy and fairness should be treated as complementary goals in predictive modeling. The work provides a foundation for understanding tradeoffs and leveraging additional information in non-binary tasks to ease fairness conflicts.

Abstract: We derive an accounting identity for predictive models that links accuracy with common fairness criteria. The identity shows that for globally calibrated models, the weighted sums of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups is equal to a "total unfairness budget." For binary outcomes, this budget is the model's mean-squared error times the difference in group prevalence across outcome classes. The identity nests standard impossibility results as special cases, while also describing inherent tradeoffs when one or more fairness measures are not perfectly satisfied. The results suggest that accuracy and fairness are best viewed as complements in binary prediction tasks: increasing accuracy necessarily shrinks the total unfairness budget and vice-versa. Experiments on benchmark data confirm the theory and show that many fairness interventions largely substitute between fairness violations, and when they reduce accuracy they tend to expand the total unfairness budget. The results extend naturally to prediction tasks with non-binary outcomes, illustrating how additional outcome information can relax fairness incompatibilities and identifying conditions under which the binary-style impossibility does and does not extend to regression tasks.

### [240] [Parametric and Generative Forecasts of Day-Ahead Market Curves for Storage Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20226)
*Julian Gutierrez,Redouane Silvente*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two machine learning frameworks for forecasting supply and demand curves and optimizing storage in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of forecasting demand and supply curves in the electricity market while optimizing storage strategies to improve revenue and system efficiency.

Method: The paper utilizes a fast parametric model for daily curve forecasting and generative models for a detailed joint distribution prediction of order submissions.

Result: Forecasting improves accuracy and interpretability in daily operations, while the optimization of storage demonstrates potential for better revenue distributions and price stabilization.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide effective forecasting tools and storage strategies, balancing market dynamics and highlighting diminishing returns as capacity increases.

Abstract: We present two machine learning frameworks for forecasting aggregated curves and optimizing storage in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market. First, a fast parametric model forecasts hourly demand and supply curves in a low-dimensional and grid-robust representation, with minimum and maximum volumes combined with a Chebyshev polynomial for the elastic segment. The model enables daily use with low error and clear interpretability. Second, for a more comprehensive analysis, though less suited to daily operation, we employ generative models that learn the joint distribution of 24-hour order-level submissions given weather and fuel variables. These models generate synthetic daily scenarios of individual buy and sell orders, which, once aggregated, yield hourly supply and demand curves. Based on these forecasts, we optimize a price-making storage strategy, quantify revenue distributions, and highlight the price-compression effect with lower peaks, higher off-peak levels, and diminishing returns as capacity expands.

*Zichao Yu,Ming Li,Wenyi Zhang,Difan Zou,Weiguo Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProFlow is a framework designed to infer physical fields from sparse observations while satisfying PDE constraints without retraining generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a sampling mechanism that can uphold strict physical consistency, observational fidelity, and statistical alignment with pre-trained generative priors in solving PDE-constrained inverse problems.

Method: ProFlow integrates a two-step mechanism: (1) optimization through proximal minimization to ensure physical and observational consistency, and (2) interpolation to reintegrate solutions into the generative prior, enabling Bayesian consistency.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art baselines on PDE frameworks like Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and Burgers' equations in physical consistency, observational fidelity, and statistical accuracy.

Conclusion: ProFlow represents a robust, retraining-free framework for solving PDE-constrained inverse problems, delivering both physical accuracy and adherence to generative priors.

Abstract: Inferring physical fields from sparse observations while strictly satisfying partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates. Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency, as well as more accurate distributional statistics, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Certificate-Guided Pruning (CGP) for noisy Lipschitz function optimization, achieving improved efficiency and guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing methods in noisy Lipschitz optimization, particularly the lack of explicit optimality certificates and measurable progress guarantees.

Method: The authors propose CGP, which maintains an active set of potentially optimal points using confidence-adjusted Lipschitz envelopes, certifying suboptimality for points outside the set. Extensions include adaptive learning, scalability to high dimensions, and hybrid techniques for local refinement.

Result: CGP demonstrates controlled rate progress in optimization and establishes near-optimal sample complexity bounds. It matches or exceeds baseline methods across benchmarks, providing stopping criteria via certificate volume.

Conclusion: CGP offers a robust solution with theoretical guarantees and practical benefits for black-box optimization of Lipschitz functions in noisy settings.

Abstract: We study black-box optimization of Lipschitz functions under noisy evaluations. Existing adaptive discretization methods implicitly avoid suboptimal regions but do not provide explicit certificates of optimality or measurable progress guarantees. We introduce \textbf{Certificate-Guided Pruning (CGP)}, which maintains an explicit \emph{active set} $A_t$ of potentially optimal points via confidence-adjusted Lipschitz envelopes. Any point outside $A_t$ is certifiably suboptimal with high probability, and under a margin condition with near-optimality dimension $α$, we prove $\Vol(A_t)$ shrinks at a controlled rate yielding sample complexity $\tildeO(\varepsilon^{-(2+α)})$. We develop three extensions: CGP-Adaptive learns $L$ online with $O(\log T)$ overhead; CGP-TR scales to $d > 50$ via trust regions with local certificates; and CGP-Hybrid switches to GP refinement when local smoothness is detected. Experiments on 12 benchmarks ($d \in [2, 100]$) show CGP variants match or exceed strong baselines while providing principled stopping criteria via certificate volume.

*Jinren Ding,Xuejian Xu,Shen Jiang,Zhitong Hao,Jinhui Yang,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework named C2 enhancing Decision Transformer for generative auto-bidding by proposing Cross Learning Block (CLB) and Constraint-aware Loss (CL), achieving superior performance in the task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Decision Transformer (DT) for generative auto-bidding by addressing limitations in modeling state, action, and return-to-go sequences, and avoiding learning suboptimal behaviors.

Method: The authors introduce C2, incorporating (1) a Cross Learning Block (CLB) for strengthened inter-sequence correlations using cross-attention, and (2) a Constraint-aware Loss (CL) to enforce selective learning of optimal trajectories under budget and CPA constraints.

Result: C2 demonstrates up to 3.23% performance improvement over state-of-the-art models (like GAVE) on the AuctionNet dataset, with robust results across varied budget settings.

Conclusion: C2 provides a robust improvement for generative auto-bidding by addressing existing limitations in DT through innovative modules like CLB and CL, proving its efficacy through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT) shows promise for generative auto-bidding by capturing temporal dependencies, but suffers from two critical limitations: insufficient cross-correlation modeling among state, action, and return-to-go (RTG) sequences, and indiscriminate learning of optimal/suboptimal behaviors. To address these, we propose C2, a novel framework enhancing DT with two core innovations: (1) a Cross Learning Block (CLB) via cross-attention to strengthen inter-sequence correlation modeling; (2) a Constraint-aware Loss (CL) incorporating budget and Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) constraints for selective learning of optimal trajectories. Extensive offline evaluations on the AuctionNet dataset demonstrate consistent performance gains (up to 3.23\% over state-of-the-art GAVE) across diverse budget settings; ablation studies verify the complementary synergy of CLB and CL, confirming C2's superiority in auto-bidding.

### [244] [Robust SDE Parameter Estimation Under Missing Time Information Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20268)
*Long Van Tran,Truyen Tran,Phuoc Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a method to recover the temporal order and estimate parameters of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) when timestamp data is incomplete or corrupted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in parameter estimation for SDEs when temporal order information is missing or corrupted, which limits current approaches' applicability in sensitive and real-world domains.

Method: The authors develop a framework that reconstructs the temporal order of data using a score-matching criterion to infer ordering of observations, followed by sorting and maximum likelihood estimation of SDE parameters.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness in recovering temporal order and estimating SDE parameters in experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets, performing well even with corrupted temporal information.

Conclusion: The approach broadens the applicability of SDE modeling to situations with missing or hidden temporal order, enhancing its robustness and utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have enabled robust modeling of real-world dynamical processes across diverse domains, such as finance, health, and systems biology. However, parameter estimation for SDEs typically relies on accurately timestamped observational sequences. When temporal ordering information is corrupted, missing, or deliberately hidden (e.g., for privacy), existing estimation methods often fail. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which temporal order can be recovered and introduce a novel framework that simultaneously reconstructs temporal information and estimates SDE parameters. Our approach exploits asymmetries between forward and backward processes, deriving a score-matching criterion to infer the correct temporal order between pairs of observations. We then recover the total order via a sorting procedure and estimate SDE parameters from the reconstructed sequence using maximum likelihood. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, extending parameter estimation to settings with missing temporal order and broadening applicability in sensitive domains.

*Daojun Liang,Qi Li,Yinglong Wang,Jing Chen,Hu Zhang,Xiaoxiao Cui,Qizheng Wang,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces $δ$-Adapter, which refines time-series forecasting accuracy and uncertainty without retraining existing models, using minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the diminishing returns of forecasting model accuracy by focusing on enhancing deployed models through post-processing strategies instead of retraining.

Method: $δ$-Adapter, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic tool, adjusts both inputs (nudging) and outputs (residual correction) to refine forecasting, select features, and calibrate uncertainties.

Result: Experiments reveal that $δ$-Adapter effectively improves forecasting accuracy and uncertainty calibration across various models and datasets, requiring minimal computation and no retraining.

Conclusion: $δ$-Adapter presents a practical and efficient solution to overcome the final accuracy gaps in forecasting, achieving enhancements while maintaining interpretability and calibration flexibility.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has long been dominated by advances in model architecture, with recent progress driven by deep learning and hybrid statistical techniques. However, as forecasting models approach diminishing returns in accuracy, a critical yet underexplored opportunity emerges: the strategic use of post-processing. In this paper, we address the last-mile gap in time-series forecasting, which is to improve accuracy and uncertainty without retraining or modifying a deployed backbone. We propose $δ$-Adapter, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic way to boost deployed time series forecasters without retraining. $δ$-Adapter learns tiny, bounded modules at two interfaces: input nudging (soft edits to covariates) and output residual correction. We provide local descent guarantees, $O(δ)$ drift bounds, and compositional stability for combined adapters. Meanwhile, it can act as a feature selector by learning a sparse, horizon-aware mask over inputs to select important features, thereby improving interpretability. In addition, it can also be used as a distribution calibrator to measure uncertainty. Thus, we introduce a Quantile Calibrator and a Conformal Corrector that together deliver calibrated, personalized intervals with finite-sample coverage. Our experiments across diverse backbones and datasets show that $δ$-Adapter improves accuracy and calibration with negligible compute and no interface changes.

*Viet Hung Dinh,Ming Ding,Youyang Qu,Kanchana Thilakarathna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how attention layers in large language models (LLMs) contribute to memory mechanisms, hypothesizing that keywords act as cues for retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing regulatory pressures have raised interest in the role of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in ensuring transparency, accountability, and privacy-preserving unlearning.

Method: The study examines attention layers in transformer-based LLMs, guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, and identifies neurons selectively encoding retrieval context keywords.

Result: Evidence is presented supporting the hypothesis that keywords serve as cues for retrieval, and neurons encoding these keywords are isolated.

Conclusion: These findings advance understanding of attention mechanisms in LLMs and promote applications like machine unlearning and transparency in AI systems.

Abstract: While explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for large language models (LLMs) remains an evolving field with many unresolved questions, increasing regulatory pressures have spurred interest in its role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and privacy-preserving machine unlearning. Despite recent advances in XAI have provided some insights, the specific role of attention layers in transformer based LLMs remains underexplored. This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords. We provide converging evidence for this keywords-as-cues hypothesis. In addition, we isolate neurons within attention layers whose activations selectively encode and facilitate the retrieval of context-defining keywords. Consequently, these keywords can be extracted from identified neurons and further contribute to downstream applications such as unlearning.

### [247] [A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20291)
*Kaiyi Yang,Seonyeong Park,Gangwon Jeong,Hsuan-Kai Huang,Alexander A. Oraevsky,Umberto Villa,Mark A. Anastasio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of spatial resolution loss in 3D PACT imaging caused by spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of ultrasound transducers by proposing a learned SIR compensation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to overcome the trade-off between computational efficiency and spatial resolution in 3D PACT imaging. Analytic methods are fast but neglect SIR effects, reducing resolution, while optimization-based methods are accurate but computationally expensive.

Method: The authors developed a data-domain learned SIR compensation framework that uses U-Net and Deconv-Net models to transform SIR-corrupted data into data suitable for fast analytic reconstruction methods. A unique training data generation procedure is also introduced.

Result: The proposed models were validated through virtual studies, showing improved resolution, noise robustness, and better handling of object complexity and sound speed variation. In breast imaging, it revealed structures obscured by SIR artifacts.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel, efficient learned SIR compensation method for 3D PACT imaging that significantly enhances resolution without compromising computational efficiency, a first in this area of research.

Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.

Motivation: To close the gap between computationally inexpensive reduced-order models and complex physical systems, particularly in multi-scale engineering challenges.

Method: Combining a fast low-fidelity model with learned discrepancy corrections to reconstruct high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor data.

Result: Successfully applied to rotating detonation engines, reconstructing high-fidelity states and isolating injector-driven effects.

Conclusion: Cheap2Rich is an effective data assimilation tool for multi-scale systems, offering quick design exploration, real-time control, and interpretable dynamics analysis.

Abstract: Bridging the sim2real gap between computationally inexpensive models and complex physical systems remains a central challenge in machine learning applications to engineering problems, particularly in multi-scale settings where reduced-order models typically capture only dominant dynamics. In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

### [249] [Truthfulness Despite Weak Supervision: Evaluating and Training LLMs Using Peer Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20299)
*Tianyi Alex Qiu,Micah Carroll,Cameron Allen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluation and post-training of large language models usually rely on robust supervision, which may be unavailable, especially for frontier models. This paper introduces the peer prediction method, leveraging game-theoretic incentive compatibility to encourage truthfulness and reliability in LLM evaluation without needing ground truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating large language models (LLMs) when strong supervision or ground truth labels are unavailable, and to resist deceptive behaviors in model evaluation and post-training.

Method: The peer prediction method rewards informative and honest outputs by utilizing metrics based on mutual predictability rather than reliance on ground truth labels. It is theoretically supported and empirically validated by testing with models ranging from 0.135B to 405B parameters.

Result: The peer prediction method is effective in resisting deceptive behaviors and improving model truthfulness. It was able to recover drops in truthfulness caused by malicious finetuning and demonstrated inverse scaling property—larger gaps between model size improve resistance to deception, even using smaller models as judges.

Conclusion: Peer prediction enhances the evaluation and training of LLMs under weak supervision and proves superior to traditional methods (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge) in resisting deception, particularly in scenarios with significant capability differences between models.

Abstract: The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark, and proposes READER, a novel GMV modeling approach, achieving significant improvements in delayed feedback prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in GMV prediction due to delayed feedback, a largely unexplored area, by focusing on continuous targets and repurchases.

Method: It establishes a benchmark named TRACE for studying GMV prediction and develops READER, a dual-branch predictor that incorporates repurchase information and dynamic calibration.

Result: READER outperforms baselines on TRACE with a 2.19% accuracy improvement, showcasing its effectiveness in modeling delayed GMV feedback.

Conclusion: The proposed READER model and TRACE benchmark significantly advance online GMV prediction, encouraging future research on delayed feedback modeling.

Abstract: The prediction objectives of online advertisement ranking models are evolving from probabilistic metrics like conversion rate (CVR) to numerical business metrics like post-click gross merchandise volume (GMV). Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction.

*Fengrui Zuo,Zhiwei Ke,Yiming Liu,Wenqi Lou,Chao Wang,Xvehai Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a window-based token pruning and caching method to optimize the inference in Diffusion Language Models (DLMs), achieving up to 99x speedup without major performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiency in DLM inference due to redundant computation on masked tokens and the limitations in applying block-wise diffusion to pretrained DLMs.

Method: A sliding computation window is introduced, dividing tokens into active tokens, buffer tokens, and far-field tokens, enabling computation optimization through token pruning and caching.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant inference speedups (up to 99x) while maintaining comparable text generation quality to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently accelerates DLM inference while preserving generation performance, making it a practical solution for optimizing pretrained DLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, but inference requires full-sequence attention at every iteration, resulting in substantial redundant computation on masked tokens. Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textbf{\placeholder}\footnote{The source code is available at https://github.com/vhicrgit/Window-Diffusion.}, a window-based token pruning and caching method for inference. We maintain a local computation window that slides rightward as denoising progresses, and partition undecoded tokens into: (i) \textit{active tokens} that are computed online, (ii) \textit{buffer tokens} whose KV states are cached and periodically refreshed, and (iii) \textit{far-field tokens} that are pruned outside the window. Computation is restricted to active and buffer tokens within the window, while far-field tokens are omitted at each stage. Experiments on LLaDA and Dream show that, under matched compute budgets, our method achieves up to $99\times$ inference speedup while largely preserving generation performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method (TABED) for accelerating Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) inference via adaptive ensemble drafting, achieving significant speedups and improvements while being training-free.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in speculative decoding (SD) methods for LVLMs and address performance inconsistencies across diverse scenarios and datasets during inference.

Method: The proposed TABED framework dynamically ensembles multiple draft tokens generated during batch inference based on deviations from past verification ground truths, ensuring scenario adaptability with minimal ensembling cost.

Result: TABED achieves a 1.74x robust walltime speedup over autoregressive decoding and a 5% performance improvement over single drafting methods while minimizing cost and remaining training-free.

Conclusion: TABED offers efficient and adaptive inference acceleration for LVLMs, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with advanced verification and drafting methods, providing practical benefits without additional training overhead.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has proven effective for accelerating LLM inference by quickly generating draft tokens and verifying them in parallel. However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), which improve time-dependent PDE solving compared to Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), achieving better accuracy and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) struggle with time-dependent PDEs due to shared weights across time causing accuracy problems and destabilized training.

Method: TINNs parameterize network weights as a learned function of time, allowing adaptable spatial representations and efficient optimization via the Levenberg-Marquardt method.

Result: TINNs achieved up to 4 times better accuracy and 10 times faster convergence on various PDE benchmarks compared to PINNs and other baselines.

Conclusion: TINNs effectively address standard PINNs' limitations by enabling dynamic time-dependent spatial representation and optimizing accuracy and convergence.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solve time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning a mesh-free, differentiable solution that can be evaluated anywhere in space and time. However, standard space--time PINNs take time as an input but reuse a single network with shared weights across all times, forcing the same features to represent markedly different dynamics. This coupling degrades accuracy and can destabilize training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly. We propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes the network weights as a learned function of time, allowing the effective spatial representation to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure. The resulting formulation naturally yields a nonlinear least-squares problem, which we optimize efficiently using a Levenberg--Marquardt method. Experiments on various time-dependent PDEs show up to $4\times$ improved accuracy and $10\times$ faster convergence compared to PINNs and strong baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether standard continuous-time generative models can effectively represent and sample distributions with highly sparse and constrained discrete supports.

Method: The study utilizes Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, trains flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path, and compares deterministic ODE sampling, stochastic SDE sampling, and DDPM-style sampling.

Result: Stochastic sampling methods significantly outperform deterministic flows. Score-based samplers succeed among continuous-time methods, while DDPM-style sampling achieves the highest validity.

Conclusion: Continuous-time generative models, although inefficient compared to classical solvers for specific tasks like Sudoku, can assign valid probabilities to globally constrained structures and are viable for constraint satisfaction through stochastic searches.

Abstract: Can standard continuous-time generative models represent distributions whose support is an extremely sparse, globally constrained discrete set? We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.

*Qing Lyu,Zhe Fu,Alexandre Bayen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for identifying rare, safety-critical driving scenarios using a multi-agent Transformer and prediction residuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rarity of safety-critical driving events makes supervised labeling impractical, and existing methods are insufficient in verifying whether anomalies align with physical danger.

Method: The authors propose an anomaly detection approach based on a multi-agent Transformer with a dual evaluation scheme assessing detection stability and physical alignment.

Result: The framework outperforms traditional metrics by identifying 388 unique anomalies, demonstrating higher physical alignment and capturing complex risks missed by other methods.

Conclusion: This approach effectively enhances the detection of safety-critical events in autonomous driving, offering novel insights for simulation and testing.

Abstract: Identifying safety-critical scenarios is essential for autonomous driving, but the rarity of such events makes supervised labeling impractical. Traditional rule-based metrics like Time-to-Collision are too simplistic to capture complex interaction risks, and existing methods lack a systematic way to verify whether statistical anomalies truly reflect physical danger. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a multi-agent Transformer that models normal driving and measures deviations through prediction residuals. A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability. Furthermore, our framework identifies 388 unique anomalies missed by Time-to-Collision and statistical baselines, capturing subtle multi-agent risks like reactive braking under lateral drift. The detected anomalies are further clustered into four interpretable risk types, offering actionable insights for simulation and testing.

*Wei Huang,Anda Cheng,Yinggui Wang,Lei Wang,Tao Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM-AutoDP, an automated data processing framework using Large Language Models to refine domain-specific data processing strategies while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require domain-specific data to improve performance, but current manual data processing approaches for such datasets are labor-intensive and pose privacy risks, especially in sensitive fields.

Method: The method involves training LLMs to autonomously develop and optimize data processing strategies through in-context learning, feedback evaluations, and three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, Processing Target Selection, and Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism.

Result: Models trained with LLM-AutoDP processed data achieved over 80% win rates against unprocessed data, and the framework outperformed AutoML baselines with a 65% win rate. The three acceleration techniques reduced search times significantly.

Conclusion: LLM-AutoDP effectively automates data processing, ensuring privacy, improving model performance, and reducing computational costs, making it promising for high-privacy domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: To address the critical challenge of generalizing federated learning models to unseen clients in the presence of heterogeneous data.

Method: FedRD leverages parameter-guided global generalization aggregation and local debiased classification to minimize divergences.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that FedRD significantly outperforms competing methods on multi-domain datasets.

Conclusion: FedRD effectively reduces optimization and performance divergences, improving generalization for heterogeneous federated learning systems.

Abstract: Heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) aims to ensure effective and privacy-preserving collaboration among different entities. As newly joined clients require significant adjustments and additional training to align with the existing system, the problem of generalizing federated learning models to unseen clients under heterogeneous data has become progressively crucial. Consequently, we highlight two unsolved challenging issues in federated domain generalization: Optimization Divergence and Performance Divergence. To tackle the above challenges, we propose FedRD, a novel heterogeneity-aware federated learning algorithm that collaboratively utilizes parameter-guided global generalization aggregation and local debiased classification to reduce divergences, aiming to obtain an optimal global model for participating and unseen clients. Extensive experiments on public multi-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits a substantial performance advantage over competing baselines in addressing this specific problem.

*Yuhang Liu,Erdun Gao,Dong Gong,Anton van den Hengel,Javen Qinfeng Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), a framework aimed at extracting human-interpretable concepts from large language models (LLMs) based on a theoretical foundation, addressing issues with sparse autoencoders (SAEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting LLMs in an understandable way is crucial for their use in essential domains, but existing methods like sparse autoencoders lack a theoretical basis connecting LLM representations to human-interpretable concepts.

Method: The authors propose Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), using a latent variable model to approximate LLM representations as linear mixtures of concept log-posteriors. Sparse ConCA introduces sparsity priors to handle the challenges of the unmixing process.

Result: By implementing 12 sparse ConCA variants, the authors demonstrated that the method successfully extracts meaningful, interpretable concepts across multiple LLMs, with theoretical advantages over existing SAEs.

Conclusion: ConCA provides a principled and effective approach to extract interpretable concepts from LLMs, addressing limitations of SAEs and offering theoretical grounding for their methodology.

Abstract: Developing human understandable interpretation of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly critical for their deployment in essential domains. Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive guidelines on data preprocessing, parameter settings, and component selection for Diffusion Map, which significantly influence results.

Method: The authors review the Diffusion Map technique, highlight common issues, and introduce a recent method to identify relevant components.

Result: Their analysis demonstrates that initial components in Diffusion Maps may not always be the most relevant ones.

Conclusion: Efforts to improve understanding of Diffusion Map’s parameter settings and component selection can enhance its application across disciplines.

Abstract: Diffusion Map is a spectral dimensionality reduction technique which is able to uncover nonlinear submanifolds in high-dimensional data. And, it is increasingly applied across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as biology, engineering, and social sciences. But data preprocessing, parameter settings and component selection have a significant influence on the resulting manifold, something which has not been comprehensively discussed in the literature so far. We provide a practice oriented review of the Diffusion Map technique, illustrate pitfalls and showcase a recently introduced technique for identifying the most relevant components. Our results show that the first components are not necessarily the most relevant ones.

*Zhiyu Chen,Minhao Liu,Yanru Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeCatcher addresses the limitations of lightweight MLP-based models in accurately forecasting non-stationary time series by introducing a volatility-aware and variational approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve long-term forecasting of highly non-stationary time series, which traditional methods struggle with, especially under sudden fluctuations in domains like web traffic monitoring.

Method: TimeCatcher combines linear architectures with a variational encoder to model latent dynamic patterns and a volatility-aware mechanism to enhance local variation detection.

Result: Experiments across nine datasets demonstrate TimeCatcher's consistent superiority over state-of-the-art models in scenarios demanding long-term forecasts, particularly in volatile and abrupt fluctuation conditions.

Conclusion: TimeCatcher provides a robust framework for handling challenging forecasting tasks, enabling better performance in volatile and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Recent lightweight MLP-based models have achieved strong performance in time series forecasting by capturing stable trends and seasonal patterns. However, their effectiveness hinges on an implicit assumption of local stationarity assumption, making them prone to errors in long-term forecasting of highly non-stationary series, especially when abrupt fluctuations occur, a common challenge in domains like web traffic monitoring. To overcome this limitation, we propose TimeCatcher, a novel Volatility-Aware Variational Forecasting framework. TimeCatcher extends linear architectures with a variational encoder to capture latent dynamic patterns hidden in historical data and a volatility-aware enhancement mechanism to detect and amplify significant local variations. Experiments on nine real-world datasets from traffic, financial, energy, and weather domains show that TimeCatcher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with particularly large improvements in long-term forecasting scenarios characterized by high volatility and sudden fluctuations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ColaPrinceCHEN/TimeCatcher.

*Fatima Ezzeddine,Obaida Ammar,Silvia Giordano,Omran Ayoub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method to produce fair counterfactual explanations (CFs) for machine learning decisions, addressing both individual and group fairness in actionable recourse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address transparency and fairness in ML models by generating CFs that ensure equitable and actionable recourse for all users, bridging individual and group fairness concerns.

Method: A novel, model-agnostic, reinforcement learning-based approach is proposed to generate CFs, incorporating fairness constraints defined at individual, group, and hybrid levels.

Result: The method was tested on three datasets, showing effective preservation of fairness across individuals and groups while maintaining the quality of CFs, with an evaluation of the associated cost of fairness.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of addressing fairness in CF generation, extending existing fairness metrics, and initiating broader discussions on hybrid fairness for XAI applications.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming increasingly essential for enhancing the transparency of machine learning (ML) models. Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.

Motivation: To understand how neural classifiers generalize effectively during training and to model their dynamics in terms of binary hypothesis testing.

Method: The authors use the framework of binary hypothesis testing, modeling neural classification through class-conditional distributions and analyzing training dynamics using metrics like KL divergence.

Result: They demonstrate that well-performing networks align increasingly with optimal decision rules (e.g., Neyman-Pearson) during training via monotonic improvements in KL divergence.

Conclusion: The work provides an explanation for neural behavior during training and offers potential training/regularization strategies tailored for different neural network types.

Abstract: We study the supervised training dynamics of neural classifiers through the lens of binary hypothesis testing. We model classification as a set of binary tests between class-conditional distributions of representations and empirically show that, along training trajectories, well-generalizing networks increasingly align with Neyman-Pearson optimal decision rules via monotonic improvements in KL divergence that relate to error rate exponents. We finally discuss how this yields an explanation and possible training or regularization strategies for different classes of neural networks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semi-supervised Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework for analyzing Alzheimer's disease progression using neuroimaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high-dimensional, complex neuroimaging data and extract meaningful disease-relevant features for assessing neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer’s, using a more interpretable and adaptable method.

Method: The paper proposes a semi-supervised VAE with a flexible similarity regularization term to align latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures. Demonstrations use PET scans, guiding one latent variable towards a cognitive score while separating confounding variables like site effects.

Result: The framework identifies reduced metabolism in Alzheimer's-affected brain regions, particularly the hippocampus and major Resting State Networks (Default Mode and Central Executive). Confounding factors are encoded separately to isolate disease-specific patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively analyzes Alzheimer’s-related patterns in neuroimaging data, aligning results with known biomarkers, and provides an adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging data presents challenges for assessing neurodegenerative diseases due to complex non-linear relationships. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks. The remaining latent variables encode affine transformations and intensity variations, capturing confounds such as inter-subject variability and site effects. Our framework effectively extracts disease-related patterns aligned with established Alzheimer's biomarkers, offering an interpretable and adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models on topological structures rely heavily on inefficient local message passing mechanisms, limiting scalability and information aggregation.

Method: Proposes CCMamba, reformulating message passing through rank-aware state-space models for efficient and adaptive information propagation without self-attention.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing methods on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks with enhanced scalability and robustness to depth.

Conclusion: CCMamba offers a significant advancement in topological deep learning, providing both higher performance and better scalability.

Abstract: Topological deep learning has emerged for modeling higher-order relational structures beyond pairwise interactions that standard graph neural networks fail to capture. Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate that CCMamba consistently outperforms existing methods while exhibiting improved scalability and robustness to depth.

Result: The approach shows superior performance in both standard and specially designed ensemble datasets, demonstrating its ability to extract useful insights from diverse learners' predictions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the strength of unsupervised ensemble learning in harnessing collective intelligence, particularly in data-scarce or privacy-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Unsupervised ensemble learning emerged to address the challenge of combining multiple learners' predictions without access to ground truth labels or additional data. This paradigm is crucial in scenarios where evaluating individual classifier performance or understanding their strengths is challenging due to limited information. We propose a novel deep energy-based method for constructing an accurate meta-learner using only the predictions of individual learners, potentially capable of capturing complex dependence structures between them. Our approach requires no labeled data, learner features, or problem-specific information, and has theoretical guarantees for when learners are conditionally independent. We demonstrate superior performance across diverse ensemble scenarios, including challenging mixture of experts settings. Our experiments span standard ensemble datasets and curated datasets designed to test how the model fuses expertise from multiple sources. These results highlight the potential of unsupervised ensemble learning to harness collective intelligence, especially in data-scarce or privacy-sensitive environments.

TL;DR: LLMs distribute sensitive/copyrighted data posing compliance challenges. PURGE offers an efficient unlearning solution without retraining, outperforming existing methods in fluency, robustness, and token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The legal compliance demands under GDPR and EU AI Act necessitate effective mechanisms to erase sensitive/copyrighted content from deployed LLMs without retraining models from scratch.

Method: PURGE uses Group Relative Policy Optimization with intrinsic rewards penalizing mentions of forbidden data, formulating unlearning as a verifiable problem.

Result: PURGE reduced token usage by up to 46 times, improved fluency by 5.48%, adversarial robustness by 12.02%, achieved 11% unlearning effectiveness, and preserved 98% of original utility.

Conclusion: PURGE advances LLM unlearning by providing reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, combining theoretical guarantees, safety, and practical deployment.

Abstract: During pretraining, LLMs inadvertently memorize sensitive or copyrighted data, posing significant compliance challenges under legal frameworks like the GDPR and the EU AI Act. Fulfilling these mandates demands techniques that can remove information from a deployed model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning approaches attempt to address this need, but often leak the very data they aim to erase, sacrifice fluency and robustness, or depend on costly external reward models. We introduce PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure), a novel method grounded in the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework that formulates unlearning as a verifiable problem. PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes any mention of forbidden concepts, allowing safe and consistent unlearning. Our approach reduces token usage per target by up to a factor of 46 compared with SotA methods, while improving fluency by 5.48 percent and adversarial robustness by 12.02 percent over the base model. On the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark, PURGE achieves 11 percent unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98 percent of original utility. PURGE shows that framing LLM unlearning as a verifiable task, enables more reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, suggesting a promising new direction for unlearning research that combines theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the difficulty in modeling inherent ordinal dependencies in ordinal regression and ranking tasks, which conventional methods fail to handle effectively.

Method: The method involves Ranking-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) that integrates regression and Learning-to-Rank (L2R) into a unified objective, with ranking-aware verifiable rewards and Response Mutation Operations (RMO) to enhance training.

Result: The paper validates the effectiveness of RARL through experiments on three different benchmarks.

Conclusion: The RARL framework effectively combines regression and ranking tasks, proving its utility for tackling ordinal dependencies in a variety of benchmarking scenarios.

Abstract: Ordinal regression and ranking are challenging due to inherent ordinal dependencies that conventional methods struggle to model. We propose Ranking-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a novel RL framework that explicitly learns these relationships. At its core, RARL features a unified objective that synergistically integrates regression and Learning-to-Rank (L2R), enabling mutual improvement between the two tasks. This is driven by a ranking-aware verifiable reward that jointly assesses regression precision and ranking accuracy, facilitating direct model updates via policy optimization. To further enhance training, we introduce Response Mutation Operations (RMO), which inject controlled noise to improve exploration and prevent stagnation at saddle points. The effectiveness of RARL is validated through extensive experiments on three distinct benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses memorization issues in diffusion-based image generative models and presents a faster and effective detection metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of memorization in image generative models, which can lead to unintended reproduction of training images and compromise model integrity.

Method: The authors analyze isotropic and anisotropic regimes in noise levels and propose a new memorization detection metric that integrates norm-based and angular alignment techniques. This approach leverages pure noise inputs and conditional/unconditional forward passes, avoiding expensive denoising steps.

Result: The proposed metric outperforms existing methods in memorization detection for Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2, showing faster and more efficient performance.

Conclusion: By combining efficient detection metrics and mitigation strategies, the paper enhances the detection and adaption of memorized content in diffusion-based models, showing promise for practical applicability in AI systems.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generative models produce high-fidelity images through iterative denoising but remain vulnerable to memorization, where they unintentionally reproduce exact copies or parts of training images. Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.

### [271] [Regularized Gradient Temporal-Difference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20599)
*Hyunjun Na,Donghwan Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in Gradient Temporal-Difference (GTD) learning algorithms caused by singularity in the feature interaction matrix (FIM). A regularized GTD (R-GTD) method is proposed to ensure stable convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current GTD learning algorithms, which assume a nonsingular FIM, by addressing performance instability when the FIM becomes singular.

Method: The authors propose reformulating the mean-square projected Bellman error (MSPBE) minimization as a regularized optimization problem, resulting in the R-GTD algorithm.

Result: The R-GTD algorithm is proven to guarantee convergence to a unique solution and demonstrate its effectiveness through both theoretical error bounds and empirical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed R-GTD method resolves stability and performance challenges of GTD algorithms when the FIM is singular, ensuring reliability in policy evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Gradient temporal-difference (GTD) learning algorithms are widely used for off-policy policy evaluation with function approximation. However, existing convergence analyses rely on the restrictive assumption that the so-called feature interaction matrix (FIM) is nonsingular. In practice, the FIM can become singular and leads to instability or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a regularized optimization objective by reformulating the mean-square projected Bellman error (MSPBE) minimization. This formulation naturally yields a regularized GTD algorithms, referred to as R-GTD, which guarantees convergence to a unique solution even when the FIM is singular. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and explicit error bounds for the proposed method, and validate its effectiveness through empirical experiments.

*Ziwei Liu,Borui Kang,Hangjie Yuan,Zixiang Zhao,Wei Li,Yifan Zhu,Tao Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework (GUI-AiF) addressing the challenges of continual learning for GUI agents under domain/resolution shifts, using new reward mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital interfaces change over time, leading to performance degradation in agents trained on fixed datasets. The motivation is to create a solution for agents needing continual adaptability to dynamic GUI environments.

Method: The authors propose GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a reinforcement fine-tuning framework using two novel rewards (APR-iF and ARR-iF) to stabilize agents' learning amid continuous data shifts.

Result: GUI-AiF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in maintaining performance amidst GUI environment transitions.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first framework for continual learning in GUI agents, demonstrating reinforcement fine-tuning's potential for adapting to dynamic GUI changes.

Abstract: As digital environments (data distribution) are in flux, with new GUI data arriving over time-introducing new domains or resolutions-agents trained on static environments deteriorate in performance. In this work, we introduce Continual GUI Agents, a new task that requires GUI agents to perform continual learning under shifted domains and resolutions. We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF). These rewards guide the agents to align with shifting interaction points and regions, mitigating the tendency of existing reward strategies to over-adapt to static grounding cues (e.g., fixed coordinates or element scales). Extensive experiments show GUI-AiF surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. Our work establishes the first continual learning framework for GUI agents, revealing the untapped potential of reinforcement fine-tuning for continual GUI Agents.

TL;DR: This paper proposes the CoBA model using 5G mmWave measurements to classify UAVs as operating in authorized or restricted airspaces, achieving superior accuracy compared to other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the security and classification of UAV operations in dense millimeter-wave (mmWave) environments, addressing the challenges of complex signal propagation and variability.

Method: The CoBA model integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Attention mechanisms to classify UAV operations, using spatial and temporal patterns from 5G mmWave radio measurements.

Result: The model outperforms traditional Machine Learning models and a fingerprinting-based benchmark, demonstrating high classification accuracy for UAV airspace monitoring.

Conclusion: CoBA proves to be a reliable method for regulated UAV airspace monitoring, highlighting its effectiveness in security-critical applications.

Abstract: Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in civilian and industrial applications, making secure low-altitude operations crucial. In dense mmWave environments, accurately classifying low-altitude UAVs as either inside authorized or restricted airspaces remains challenging, requiring models that handle complex propagation and signal variability. This paper proposes a deep learning model, referred to as CoBA, which stands for integrated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Attention which leverages Fifth Generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio measurements to classify UAV operations in authorized and restricted airspaces at low altitude. The proposed CoBA model integrates convolutional, bidirectional recurrent, and attention layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in UAV radio measurements. To validate the model, a dedicated dataset is collected using the 5G mmWave network at TalTech, with controlled low altitude UAV flights in authorized and restricted scenarios. The model is evaluated against conventional ML models and a fingerprinting-based benchmark. Experimental results show that CoBA achieves superior accuracy, significantly outperforming all baseline models and demonstrating its potential for reliable and regulated UAV airspace monitoring.

TL;DR: C3Box is a Python toolbox designed to unify and streamline Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) through the use of CLIP-based frameworks, focusing on reproducibility and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning methods, including fragmented codebases and lack of standardized comparisons, which hinder reproducibility and broad adoption.

Method: Developed C3Box, a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox that integrates diverse CIL methods, uses a JSON-based configuration system, and ensures compatibility with open-source libraries.

Result: C3Box provides a unified, user-friendly framework for conducting reproducible experiments and serves as a benchmark platform for continual learning, supporting major operating systems.

Conclusion: C3Box facilitates reproducible and streamlined Class-Incremental Learning research by leveraging CLIP-based frameworks and ensuring ease of use for researchers.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning systems are typically designed for static data distributions, which suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning from evolving data streams. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) addresses this challenge by enabling learning systems to continuously learn new classes while preserving prior knowledge. With the rise of pre-trained models (PTMs) such as CLIP, leveraging their strong generalization and semantic alignment capabilities has become a promising direction in CIL. However, existing CLIP-based CIL methods are often scattered across disparate codebases, rely on inconsistent configurations, hindering fair comparisons, reproducibility, and practical adoption. Therefore, we propose C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental learning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox. C3Box integrates representative traditional CIL methods, ViT-based CIL methods, and state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods into a unified CLIP-based framework. By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research. Designed to be user-friendly, C3Box relies only on widely used open-source libraries and supports major operating systems. The code is available at https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/C3Box.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, WFR-MFM, for efficient modeling and prediction of dynamics in single-cell biology, achieving faster performance without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of reconstructing dynamical processes in single-cell biology with limited data necessitates methods capable of combining transport and mass variation efficiently.

Method: The authors introduce a mean-flow framework for unbalanced flow matching, summarizing transport and mass-growth dynamics with mean velocity and mass-growth fields, and propose the WFR-MFM approach to solve dynamic unbalanced optimal transport.

Result: WFR-MFM significantly accelerates inference times compared to existing methods while retaining high accuracy, demonstrated on both synthetic and real single-cell datasets.

Conclusion: WFR-MFM is a scalable and effective method for studying single-cell dynamics, providing faster and accurate predictions, and enabling applications such as perturbation response modeling at scale.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamical evolution from limited observations is a fundamental challenge in single-cell biology, where dynamic unbalanced optimal transport provides a principled framework for modeling coupled transport and mass variation. However, existing approaches rely on trajectory simulation at inference time, making inference a key bottleneck for scalable applications. In this work, we propose a mean-flow framework for unbalanced flow matching that summarizes both transport and mass-growth dynamics over arbitrary time intervals using mean velocity and mass-growth fields, enabling fast one-step generation without trajectory simulation. To solve dynamic unbalanced optimal transport under the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry, we further build on this framework to develop Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Mean Flow Matching (WFR-MFM). Across synthetic and real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, WFR-MFM achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference than a range of existing baselines while maintaining high predictive accuracy, and enables efficient perturbation response prediction on large synthetic datasets with thousands of conditions.

*Gawon Lee,Hanbyeol Park,Minseop Kim,Dohee Kim,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in time series forecasting by combining linear models with convolutional approaches, introducing the ACFormer architecture to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of linear models in handling non-linear signals and effectively model temporal dependencies and correlations in time series forecasting.

Method: The authors performed a receptive field analysis of CNN models, designed the ACFormer architecture with shared compression modules, gated attention, and patch expansion layers, and analyzed its ability to balance linear and non-linear modeling.

Result: ACFormer demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various benchmark datasets, successfully addressing challenges associated with capturing high-frequency components and non-linear dynamics.

Conclusion: The fusion of linear efficiencies with convolutional robustness in ACFormer presents a strong methodology for accurate time series forecasting, addressing both global trends and intricate structural dependencies.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) faces challenges in modeling complex intra-channel temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations. Although recent research has highlighted the efficiency of linear architectures in capturing global trends, these models often struggle with non-linear signals. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic receptive field analysis of convolutional neural network (CNN) TSF models. We introduce the "individual receptive field" to uncover granular structural dependencies, revealing that convolutional layers act as feature extractors that mirror channel-wise attention while exhibiting superior robustness to non-linear fluctuations. Based on these insights, we propose ACFormer, an architecture designed to reconcile the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions. ACFormer captures fine-grained information through a shared compression module, preserves temporal locality via gated attention, and reconstructs variable-specific temporal patterns using an independent patch expansion layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating the inherent drawbacks of linear models in capturing high-frequency components.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for exploring functionally diverse neural networks within the Rashomon set while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: The framework uses FiLM layers and CMA-ES to generate diverse models without requiring retraining or gradient access.

Result: DIVERSE demonstrated success in generating functionally distinct, high-performing models on MNIST, PneumoniaMNIST, and CIFAR-10, with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: DIVERSE successfully creates robust diverse model sets with efficient computation, making it feasible to support well-balanced model multiplicity.

Abstract: We propose DIVERSE, a framework for systematically exploring the Rashomon set of deep neural networks, the collection of models that match a reference model's accuracy while differing in their predictive behavior. DIVERSE augments a pretrained model with Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers and uses Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to search a latent modulation space, generating diverse model variants without retraining or gradient access. Across MNIST, PneumoniaMNIST, and CIFAR-10, DIVERSE uncovers multiple high-performing yet functionally distinct models. Our experiments show that DIVERSE offers a competitive and efficient exploration of the Rashomon set, making it feasible to construct diverse sets that maintain robustness and performance while supporting well-balanced model multiplicity. While retraining remains the baseline to generate Rashomon sets, DIVERSE achieves comparable diversity at reduced computational cost.

*Leon Götz,Lars Frederik Peiss,Erik Sauer,Andreas Udo Sass,Thorsten Bagdonat,Stephan Günnemann,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a foundation model for virtual sensors, achieving efficiency and scalability while improving predictive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual sensor models are application-specific, require expert-selected inputs for each sensor, cannot utilize synergies, and lack standard benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose a unified foundation model that predicts diverse virtual sensors, learns relevant inputs autonomously, and optimizes computational efficiency and explainability.

Result: The model achieves a 415x reduction in computation time and 951x in memory usage while maintaining or improving predictive performance during large-scale evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model offers scalability, efficiency, and enhanced quality for virtual sensor tasks, making it practical for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Virtual sensors use machine learning to predict target signals from available measurements, replacing expensive physical sensors in critical applications. Existing virtual sensor approaches require application-specific models with hand-selected inputs for each sensor, cannot leverage task synergies, and lack consistent benchmarks. At the same time, emerging time series foundation models are computationally expensive and limited to predicting their input signals, making them incompatible with virtual sensors. We introduce the first foundation model for virtual sensors addressing both limitations. Our unified model can simultaneously predict diverse virtual sensors exploiting synergies while maintaining computational efficiency. It learns relevant input signals for each virtual sensor, eliminating expert knowledge requirements while adding explainability. In our large-scale evaluation on a standard benchmark and an application-specific dataset with over 18 billion samples, our architecture achieves 415x reduction in computation time and 951x reduction in memory requirements, while maintaining or even improving predictive quality compared to baselines. Our model scales gracefully to hundreds of virtual sensors with nearly constant parameter count, enabling practical deployment in large-scale sensor networks.

*Panayiotis Ioannou,Pietro Liò,Pietro Cicuta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Neural ODEs (NODEs) for extrapolating dynamics and Symbolic Regression (SR) to infer governing equations from noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance scientific discovery by accurately modelling the dynamics of complex systems and discovering their governing differential equations.

Method: The research uses synthetic data from damped oscillatory systems to evaluate NODEs' extrapolation capabilities and SR's ability to recover equations.

Result: The findings indicate that NODEs can extrapolate under specific conditions, SR performs well when given correct input variables, and SR recovers most equations from NODE-enriched data.

Conclusion: Using NODEs to expand limited data combined with SR to infer physical laws could advance techniques for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Accurately modelling the dynamics of complex systems and discovering their governing differential equations are critical tasks for accelerating scientific discovery. Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation. While this last finding highlights an area for future work, our results suggest that using NODEs to enrich limited data and enable symbolic regression to infer physical laws represents a promising new approach for scientific discovery.

### [280] [Learning Contextual Runtime Monitors for Safe AI-Based Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20666)
*Alejandro Luque-Cerpa,Mengyuan Wang,Emil Carlsson,Sanjit A. Seshia,Devdatt Dubhashi,Hazem Torfah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that creates context-aware monitors to improve safety and performance in AI-based control ensembles by selecting the best controller for specific contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI controllers can perform poorly in unfamiliar environments, posing safety risks. Current ensemble methods often fail to leverage individual controller strengths effectively.

Method: The authors approach this issue by framing the problem as contextual monitoring. They use contextual multi-armed bandits to develop a framework where monitors select the optimal controller based on real-time system context.

Result: Tests in simulated autonomous driving scenarios show that the framework significantly enhances both safety and performance compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed context-sensitive monitoring ensures better use of controller capabilities while providing theoretical safety guarantees in controller selection.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning context-aware runtime monitors for AI-based control ensembles. Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.

TL;DR: MuRAL-CPD introduces a semi-supervised approach to Change Point Detection (CPD), leveraging wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition and user feedback for better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CPD methods lack adaptability to specific task definitions and cannot utilize user feedback effectively.

Method: MuRAL-CPD utilizes multiresolution wavelet decomposition and active learning with user feedback to optimize hyperparameters for detecting changes.

Result: The method outperformed state-of-the-art CPD approaches in experiments with real-world datasets, especially under minimal supervision conditions.

Conclusion: MuRAL-CPD demonstrates improved adaptability, accuracy, and interpretability by incorporating user input and multiresolution analysis for CPD.

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) is a critical task in time series analysis, aiming to identify moments when the underlying data-generating process shifts. Traditional CPD methods often rely on unsupervised techniques, which lack adaptability to task-specific definitions of change and cannot benefit from user knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose MuRAL-CPD, a novel semi-supervised method that integrates active learning into a multiresolution CPD algorithm. MuRAL-CPD leverages a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition to detect changes across multiple temporal scales and incorporates user feedback to iteratively optimize key hyperparameters. This interaction enables the model to align its notion of change with that of the user, improving both accuracy and interpretability. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MuRAL-CPD against state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where minimal supervision is available.

### [282] [Positive-Unlabeled Reinforcement Learning Distillation for On-Premise Small Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20687)
*Zhiqiang Kou,Junyang Chen,Xin-Qiang Cai,Xiaobo Xia,Ming-Kun Xie,Dong-Dong Wu,Biao Liu,Yuheng Jia,Xin Geng,Masashi Sugiyama,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a PU RL distillation method for small models deployed on-premises, bypassing costly RL alignment stages that require human-labeled preferences or high-quality reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to privacy, cost, and latency, on-premise deployment of small models has become common, but achieving RL alignment remains impractical due to expensive requirements like annotation or reward models.

Method: The proposed method uses self-ranking based on teacher-generated preferences without human-labeled data, enabling a locally trainable student model to optimize preferences via direct or group relative policy optimization.

Result: Theoretical analyses validate the consistency and concentration of preference signals, while experiments show strong performance in low-cost on-premise settings.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses privacy, cost, and latency constraints by bypassing traditional RL alignment requirements and achieving efficient preference optimization for small models on-premise.

Abstract: Due to constraints on privacy, cost, and latency, on-premise deployment of small models is increasingly common. However, most practical pipelines stop at supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and fail to reach the reinforcement learning (RL) alignment stage. The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistently strong performance under a low-cost setting.

*Enrique Valero-Leal,Bernd Bischl,Pedro Larrañaga,Concha Bielza,Giuseppe Casalicchio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel method for group counterfactuals using optimal transport, improving generalization and geometry preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for group counterfactual explanations face several challenges: lack of generalization, reliance on strong assumptions, and poor control over geometry distortion.

Method: Introduces the use of an optimal transport map to efficiently and effectively determine group counterfactuals without re-optimization.

Result: The new approach generalizes well, maintains group geometry, and shows superior performance compared to baselines, even when linearity is not applicable.

Conclusion: The method is an innovative, effective solution for group counterfactual explanations, facilitating interpretable and generalized actionable recourse.

Abstract: Group counterfactual explanations find a set of counterfactual instances to explain a group of input instances contrastively. However, existing methods either (i) optimize counterfactuals only for a fixed group and do not generalize to new group members, (ii) strictly rely on strong model assumptions (e.g., linearity) for tractability or/and (iii) poorly control the counterfactual group geometry distortion. We instead learn an explicit optimal transport map that sends any group instance to its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing the group's total transport cost. This enables generalization with fewer parameters, making it easier to interpret the common actionable recourse. For linear classifiers, we prove that functions representing group counterfactuals are derived via mathematical optimization, identifying the underlying convex optimization type (QP, QCQP, ...). Experiments show that they accurately generalize, preserve group geometry and incur only negligible additional transport cost compared to baseline methods. If model linearity cannot be exploited, our approach also significantly outperforms the baselines.

### [284] [Is Pure Exploitation Sufficient in Exogenous MDPs with Linear Function Approximation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20694)
*Hao Liang,Jiayu Cheng,Sean R. Sinclair,Yali Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) for Exo-MDPs, showing that exploration is unnecessary. It provides regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms and develops new tools for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the gap between empirical success of greedy methods in Exo-MDPs and the lack of theoretical support, specifically addressing the overemphasis on exploration in existing literature.

Method: The paper proposes PEL, proving finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in tabular and large-state spaces. It introduces counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport to ensure accurate value estimates without exploration.

Result: PEL achieves regret bounds in tabular scenarios and introduces LSVI-PE for large continuous state spaces. Experiments show PEL outperforming existing baselines in both synthetic and resource management tasks.

Conclusion: Exploration is unnecessary in Exo-MDPs; pure exploitation is sufficient for achieving strong performance, overturning conventional wisdom in the field.

Abstract: Exogenous MDPs (Exo-MDPs) capture sequential decision-making where uncertainty comes solely from exogenous inputs that evolve independently of the learner's actions. This structure is especially common in operations research applications such as inventory control, energy storage, and resource allocation, where exogenous randomness (e.g., demand, arrivals, or prices) drives system behavior. Despite decades of empirical evidence that greedy, exploitation-only methods work remarkably well in these settings, theory has lagged behind: all existing regret guarantees for Exo-MDPs rely on explicit exploration or tabular assumptions. We show that exploration is unnecessary. We propose Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) and prove the first general finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in Exo-MDPs. In the tabular case, PEL achieves $\widetilde{O}(H^2|Ξ|\sqrt{K})$. For large, continuous endogenous state spaces, we introduce LSVI-PE, a simple linear-approximation method whose regret is polynomial in the feature dimension, exogenous state space, and horizon, independent of the endogenous state and action spaces. Our analysis introduces two new tools: counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport, which together allow greedy policies to have accurate value estimates without optimism. Experiments on synthetic and resource-management tasks show that PEL consistently outperforming baselines. Overall, our results overturn the conventional wisdom that exploration is required, demonstrating that in Exo-MDPs, pure exploitation is enough.

*Melika Mobini,Vincent Holst,Floriano Tori,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers examined whether reference lists generated by large language models (LLMs) are distinguishable from human-curated lists. They found that, while graph structure features showed limited differentiation, semantic embeddings significantly improved separation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the references generated by large language models (LLMs) resemble human-curated bibliographies, and to identify how these lists can be characterized or differentiated.

Method: The authors built citation graphs for 10,000 papers, comparing GPT-4o-generated references, ground truth references, and a randomized baseline. They applied various methods including node structure features, semantic embeddings, random forest (RF) classifiers, and graph neural networks (GNNs) to test their ability to distinguish the sources.

Result: Results showed that graph structure features like degree and clustering separated random baselines effectively but provided limited accuracy (around 60%) when distinguishing GPT and human references. Semantic embeddings sharply increased RF accuracy (to approximately 83%), and GNNs achieved 93% accuracy for GPT vs human references.

Conclusion: Human-curated and LLM-generated bibliographies closely resemble each other in graph structure but differ in semantic content. Techniques for detection and bias correction should focus on content signals rather than structural properties.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to curate bibliographies, raising the question: are their reference lists distinguishable from human ones? We build paired citation graphs, ground truth and GPT-4o-generated (from parametric knowledge), for 10,000 focal papers ($\approx$ 275k references) from SciSciNet, and added a field-matched random baseline that preserves out-degree and field distributions while breaking latent structure. We compare (i) structure-only node features (degree/closeness/eigenvector centrality, clustering, edge count) with (ii) 3072-D title/abstract embeddings, using an RF on graph-level aggregates and Graph Neural Networks with node features. Structure alone barely separates GPT from ground truth (RF accuracy $\approx$ 0.60) despite cleanly rejecting the random baseline ($\approx$ 0.89--0.92). By contrast, embeddings sharply increase separability: RF on aggregated embeddings reaches $\approx$ 0.83, and GNNs with embedding node features achieve 93\% test accuracy on GPT vs.\ ground truth. We show the robustness of our findings by replicating the pipeline with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and with multiple embedding models (OpenAI and SPECTER), with RF separability for ground truth vs.\ Claude $\approx 0.77$ and clean rejection of the random baseline. Thus, LLM bibliographies, generated purely from parametric knowledge, closely mimic human citation topology, but leave detectable semantic fingerprints; detection and debiasing should target content signals rather than global graph structure.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of RL agents performing poorly in dynamic, non-stationary environments, particularly when faced with shifting reward functions and expanding action spaces.

Method: MORPHIN integrates concept drift detection with dynamic adjustments to learning and exploration hyperparameters to enable adaptation while preserving prior policy knowledge.

Conclusion: The framework improves RL performance in dynamic environments by enabling efficient and flexible on-the-fly adaptation without retraining.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in real-world applications where environmental conditions are non-stationary, particularly when reward functions shift or the available action space expands. This paper introduces MORPHIN, a self-adaptive Q-learning framework that enables on-the-fly adaptation without full retraining. By integrating concept drift detection with dynamic adjustments to learning and exploration hyperparameters, MORPHIN adapts agents to changes in both the reward function and on-the-fly expansions of the agent's action space, while preserving prior policy knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our approach using a Gridworld benchmark and a traffic signal control simulation. The results demonstrate that MORPHIN achieves superior convergence speed and continuous adaptation compared to a standard Q-learning baseline, improving learning efficiency by up to 1.7x.

*Anchen Sun,Zhibin Chen,Xiaodong Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep semi-supervised learning model (Cox-MT) to improve survival analysis predictions in cancer prognosis by leveraging labeled and unlabeled data. It outperforms prior ANN-based Cox models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of ANN-based Cox models, where high-dimensional features require a substantial amount of labeled data for training, by utilizing semi-supervised learning to enhance performance with fewer labeled samples.

Method: The authors developed Cox-MT, a semi-supervised learning framework based on the Mean Teacher (MT) architecture that uses both labeled and unlabeled data. They applied it to RNA-seq and whole-slide image data for cancer prognosis predictions.

Result: The Cox-MT model outperformed the existing ANN-based Cox-nnet model in single-modal and multi-modal setups across several cancer types. Performance improved as additional unlabeled data was incorporated.

Conclusion: Cox-MT significantly enhances survival prediction accuracy in cancer prognosis by integrating labeled and unlabeled data, offering substantial improvements over traditional ANN-based Cox models.

Abstract: The Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model is widely used in survival analysis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN)-based Cox-PH models have been developed. However, training these Cox models with high-dimensional features typically requires a substantial number of labeled samples containing information about time-to-event. The limited availability of labeled data for training often constrains the performance of ANN-based Cox models. To address this issue, we employed a deep semi-supervised learning (DSSL) approach to develop single- and multi-modal ANN-based Cox models based on the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training. We applied our model, named Cox-MT, to predict the prognosis of several types of cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our single-modal Cox-MT models, utilizing TCGA RNA-seq data or whole slide images, significantly outperformed the existing ANN-based Cox model, Cox-nnet, using the same data set across four types of cancer considered. As the number of unlabeled samples increased, the performance of Cox-MT significantly improved with a given set of labeled data. Furthermore, our multi-modal Cox-MT model demonstrated considerably better performance than the single-modal model. In summary, the Cox-MT model effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to significantly enhance prediction accuracy compared to existing ANN-based Cox models trained solely on labeled data.

### [288] [Training Reasoning Models on Saturated Problems via Failure-Prefix Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20829)
*Minwu Kim,Safal Shrestha,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces failure-prefix conditioning to improve learning in saturated reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) by exposing models to failure-prone states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training often stalls in RLVR as informative failures are poorly accessible, limiting the model's reasoning improvements on complex problems.

Method: Failure-prefix conditioning reallocates exploration by training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning, which exposes models to failure-prone states and facilitates learning.

Result: The proposed method achieves performance gains equivalent to medium-difficulty training while preserving token efficiency. Iterative refreshing of failure prefixes further extends improvement.

Conclusion: Failure-prefix conditioning is a promising method to address stalling in RLVR training, improving model reasoning by leveraging rare failures and extending training on saturated problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.

### [289] [HESTIA: A Hessian-Guided Differentiable Quantization-Aware Training Framework for Extremely Low-Bit LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20745)
*Guoan Wang,Feiyu Wang,Zongwei Lv,Yikun Zong,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hestia, a framework for optimizing extremely low-bit quantization in large language models (LLMs), achieving significant performance gains through Hessian-guided temperature-controlled quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models grow, their deployment is hindered by memory constraints, leading to a need for extremely low-bit quantization methods that maintain model performance.

Method: The authors propose Hestia, a quantization-aware training method that uses Hessian-guided softmax relaxation to replace rigid quantization, progressively hardening it during training and leveraging tensor-wise Hessian traces for fine-grained annealing.

Result: Hestia achieves consistent improvements on Llama-3.2 models, with zero-shot evaluation improvements of 5.39% for 1B models and 4.34% for 3B models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Hestia effectively addresses quantization challenges in low-bit LLMs with its Hessian-guided approach, improving representational capacity and enabling better performance. The code is open-source for further research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, deployment is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory wall, motivating a shift toward extremely low-bit quantization. However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models. These results indicate that Hessian-guided relaxation effectively recovers representational capacity, establishing a more robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/hestia2026/Hestia.

*Brian Christian,Jessica A. F. Thompson,Elle Michelle Yang,Vincent Adam,Hannah Rose Kirk,Christopher Summerfield,Tsvetomira Dumbalska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reward models (RMs) inherit significant behavioral biases from their base language models, impacting alignment with human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how pre-trained large language models (LLMs) affect the behavior and value-alignment of reward models (RMs), which are critical for aligning AI outputs with human preferences.

Method: The study analyzed 10 leading open-weight RMs using psycholinguistic corpora to identify behavioral patterns. Preference bias was examined using psychological axes like 'agency' and 'communion.' The researchers explored log-probability differences and ran ablation experiments to validate findings.

Result: RMs demonstrated distinct biases tied to their base models, such as Llama RMs favoring agency and Gemma RMs favoring communion. This bias persisted even when finetuning and preference data were identical.

Conclusion: Base model selection strongly influences RM behavior and alignment with human values, emphasizing the need for safety and alignment considerations during the pretraining stage of AI development.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values but have received less attention than pre-trained and post-trained LLMs themselves. Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the "Big Two" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for "agency" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for "communion." This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.

*Zhiheng Jiang,Yunzhe Wang,Ryan Marr,Ellen Novoseller,Benjamin T. Files,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraphAllocBench, a graph-based benchmark for Preference-Conditioned Policy Learning (PCPL) in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL), addressing realism and scalability issues in prior PCPL benchmarks. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PCPL benchmarks are limited to toy environments and lack scalability, motivating the need for realistic and flexible benchmarks to analyze complex, high-dimensional resource allocation tasks.

Method: The authors developed GraphAllocBench, which includes a graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment called CityPlannerEnv, design two new metrics (PNDS and OS) for evaluating preference consistency, and evaluate performance using MLPs and graph-aware models.

Result: GraphAllocBench successfully highlights limitations in existing MORL approaches and suggests the utility of graph-based methods like Graph Neural Networks for high-dimensional combinatorial tasks.

Conclusion: GraphAllocBench offers a versatile and extensible platform for developing and testing PCPL methods, promoting advancements in this area.

Abstract: Preference-Conditioned Policy Learning (PCPL) in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) aims to approximate diverse Pareto-optimal solutions by conditioning policies on user-specified preferences over objectives. This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

*Immanuel Abdi,Akshat Gupta,Micah Mok,Alexander Lu,Nicholas Lee,Gopala Anumanchipalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Evolutionary Strategies (ES) and its forgetting behavior during continual learning, comparing it to gradient-based algorithms like GRPO in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of continual learning in AI, particularly the high memory demand of gradient-based algorithms, by exploring gradient-free alternatives like Evolutionary Strategies (ES).

Method: Comprehensive analysis and evaluation of ES, including a study of its forgetting curves and comparison with GRPO performance on math and reasoning tasks.

Result: ES performs comparably to GRPO in performance for specific tasks within a similar compute budget but suffers from significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its use for continual learning.

Conclusion: Although ES shows promise as a gradient-free learning approach, its propensity for forgetting highlights its limitations and the need for future research to reduce forgetting in such methods.

Abstract: One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.

*Elizabeth L. Baker,Alexander Denker,Jes Frellsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends score-based diffusion models to infinite-dimensional function spaces for Bayesian inverse problems. It proposes a novel method to condition models and efficiently sample posterior distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enhance diffusion models in function spaces to solve inverse problems in function spaces, particularly where traditional methods fail to handle posterior conditioning rigorously.

Method: The authors extended Doob's $h$-transform to infinite dimensions for conditioning diffusion models. They introduced a Supervised Guidance Training objective for simulation-free training to sample posteriors effectively.

Result: The paper validates the proposed method theoretically and through numerical examples, demonstrating accuracy in sampling from posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems.

Conclusion: This work pioneers a method to enable function-space diffusion models for posterior sampling, bridging a significant theoretical gap in conditioning such models.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.

*Nan Qiao,Sheng Yue,Shuning Wang,Yongheng Deng,Ju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of distributional shift in offline reinforcement learning, exacerbated by OOD areas, and proposes two strategies to mitigate it: partitioned buffer sampling and a gradient-based corrective penalty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges caused by distributional shift in offline reinforcement learning, particularly with limited data or OOD datasets, which result in biased optimization and degraded policy learning.

Method: Introduces: (1) Partitioned buffer sampling (Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD - C^4), restricting updates to localized replay partitions, and (2) A gradient-based corrective penalty, explicitly canceling covariance-induced bias in updates.

Result: The strategies result in higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns compared to previous methods, especially in challenging OOD data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate the harmful effects of distributional shift in offline RL, balancing conservatism and stability without compromising the policy constrained behavior.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in offline reinforcement learning is distributional shift. Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning. Empirically, our method showcases higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns over prior methods, especially with small datasets and splits that emphasize OOD areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of ensuring stable, accurate long-term predictions in embedded AI systems with limited computational capacity.

Method: COMET-SG1 utilizes linear encoding, memory-based transition estimation, and deterministic state updates to deliver stable autoregressive predictions on edge devices.

Result: Experiments show COMET-SG1 offers competitive short-term accuracy and drastically less prediction drift over the long term compared to other models like MLP and LSTM.

Conclusion: COMET-SG1 is a practical, interpretable model for edge AI systems, featuring stability, low computational requirements, and compatibility with fixed-point arithmetic.

Abstract: COMET-SG1 is a lightweight, stability-oriented autoregressive regression model designed for time-series prediction on edge and embedded AI systems. Unlike recurrent neural networks or transformer-based sequence models, COMET-SG1 operates through linear behavior-space encoding, memory-anchored transition estimation, and deterministic state updates. This structure prioritizes bounded long-horizon behavior under fully autoregressive inference, a critical requirement for edge deployment where prediction errors accumulate over time. Experiments on non-stationary synthetic time-series data demonstrate that COMET-SG1 achieves competitive short-horizon accuracy while exhibiting significantly reduced long-horizon drift compared to MLP, LSTM, and k-nearest neighbor baselines. With a compact parameter footprint and operations compatible with fixed-point arithmetic, COMET-SG1 provides a practical and interpretable approach for stable autoregressive prediction in edge and embedded AI applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for upgrading legacy machine learning models by copying them based on input-output queries, focusing on improving replication when original data or model internals are absent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of efficiently upgrading legacy models under constraints of limited training data or inaccessible model internals, while enhancing accuracy and interpretability.

Method: A distance-based copying framework that shifts from hard-label outputs to signed distance-based regression, incorporating smoothing schemes and algorithms for estimating distances with label-only access.

Result: The proposed approach showed improved fidelity and generalization accuracy compared to traditional hard-label methods, while enabling useful uncertainty signals in replicated models.

Conclusion: Distance-based copying offers a practical and effective solution for black-box model replication, with enhanced recovery of decision boundaries and potential applications in model interpretability.

Abstract: Deployed machine learning systems must continuously evolve as data, architectures, and regulations change, often without access to original training data or model internals. In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $α$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with Hölder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access. Experiments on synthetic problems and UCI benchmarks show consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, while enabling distance outputs as uncertainty-related signals for black-box replicas.

TL;DR: This paper explores the statistical limits of multitask learning and proves that its challenges cannot be mitigated by simply increasing the sample size per task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the statistical boundaries and impossibility of multitask learning even with abundant data per task, challenging prior notions of adaptability in the field.

Method: The paper builds upon and extends prior theoretical findings, providing a stronger impossibility result by exploring adaptation limits in multitask learning with larger sample sizes per task.

Result: It establishes that the difficulty of multitask learning persists irrespective of task sample sizes, proving a key point about its statistical constraints.

Conclusion: Multitask learning faces inherent statistical limitations that cannot be overcome even with extensive data. Future exploration of optimal adaptivity could further illuminate this field.

Abstract: Multitask learning and related frameworks have achieved tremendous success in modern applications. In multitask learning problem, we are given a set of heterogeneous datasets collected from related source tasks and hope to enhance the performance above what we could hope to achieve by solving each of them individually. The recent work of arXiv:2006.15785 has showed that, without access to distributional information, no algorithm based on aggregating samples alone can guarantee optimal risk as long as the sample size per task is bounded.
  In this paper, we focus on understanding the statistical limits of multitask learning. We go beyond the no-free-lunch theorem in arXiv:2006.15785 by establishing a stronger impossibility result of adaptation that holds for arbitrarily large sample size per task. This improvement conveys an important message that the hardness of multitask learning cannot be overcame by having abundant data per task. We also discuss the notion of optimal adaptivity that may be of future interests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve understanding of active learning's label complexity for decision trees and develop efficient algorithms under constrained settings.

Method: Analyze disagreement coefficient for decision trees under specific assumptions and propose a general active learning algorithm for binary classification with polylogarithmic label complexity.

Result: Designed an active learning algorithm with polylogarithmic label complexity and established close-to-optimal dependence on error tolerance.

Conclusion: The paper advances active learning for decision trees by providing theoretical insights and presenting efficient algorithms under stipulated conditions.

Abstract: This paper advances the theoretical understanding of active learning label complexity for decision trees as binary classifiers. We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+ε)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $ε$ is close to optimal.

TL;DR: The paper introduces condPED-ANOVA, a framework to better estimate hyperparameter importance (HPI) in conditional search spaces, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like PED-ANOVA cannot handle conditional hyperparameter dependencies in search spaces, which is a limitation when estimating hyperparameter importance (HPI).

Method: The authors derive a conditional HPI for top-performing regions and propose a closed-form estimator tailored for conditional search spaces.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that naive adaptations of existing tools for conditional hyperparameters produce inaccurate or unclear results, while condPED-ANOVA provides reliable and interpretable HPI estimates.

Conclusion: condPED-ANOVA is a superior solution for understanding hyperparameter importance in conditional search spaces, effectively addressing the shortcomings of previous methods.

Abstract: We propose conditional PED-ANOVA (condPED-ANOVA), a principled framework for estimating hyperparameter importance (HPI) in conditional search spaces, where the presence or domain of a hyperparameter can depend on other hyperparameters. Although the original PED-ANOVA provides a fast and efficient way to estimate HPI within the top-performing regions of the search space, it assumes a fixed, unconditional search space and therefore cannot properly handle conditional hyperparameters. To address this, we introduce a conditional HPI for top-performing regions and derive a closed-form estimator that accurately reflects conditional activation and domain changes. Experiments show that naive adaptations of existing HPI estimators yield misleading or uninterpretable importance estimates in conditional settings, whereas condPED-ANOVA consistently provides meaningful importances that reflect the underlying conditional structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDPO, a method that uses textual feedback from verifiable environments to enhance feedback-based reinforcement learning, improving learning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the credit-assignment bottleneck in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, which traditionally relies on scalar outcome rewards, and to utilize rich textual feedback effectively.

Method: The authors propose Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), where the existing model uses feedback as a self-teacher. The feedback-informed token predictions are distilled back into the policy to refine learning.

Result: SDPO improves sample efficiency and accuracy over RLVR baselines in scientific reasoning, programming, and tool use. It also outperforms in scalar-feedback settings by leveraging successful rollouts as implicit feedback.

Conclusion: SDPO effectively utilizes rich feedback in reinforcement learning to enhance performance, reduce attempts needed, and accelerate discovery in binary-reward tasks.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly post-trained with reinforcement learning in verifiable domains such as code and math. Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.

*Steve Azzolin,Stefano Teso,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini,Sagar Malhotra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies critical issues with explanations provided by Self-explainable Graph Neural Networks (SE-GNNs) and proposes a new metric to address their unfaithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of characterization of failure cases in explanations given by SE-GNNs, especially since such explanations can be misleading and unfaithful, leading to potential misuse.

Method: The authors perform an empirical analysis to demonstrate how degenerate explanations either emerge naturally or can be maliciously manipulated, and also propose a novel faithfulness metric to reliably detect such failures.

Result: Findings show SE-GNNs achieving optimal true risk while producing unfaithful explanations, and existing metrics fail to detect this. The proposed metric effectively flags unfaithful explanations.

Conclusion: Reliable auditing mechanisms, such as the introduced faithfulness metric, are critical in ensuring explanation faithfulness for SE-GNNs.

Abstract: Explanations provided by Self-explainable Graph Neural Networks (SE-GNNs) are fundamental for understanding the model's inner workings and for identifying potential misuse of sensitive attributes. Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings.

*Zihao Wang,Hang Yin,Lihui Liu,Hanghang Tong,Yangqiu Song,Ginny Wong,Simon See*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the dimensional requirements for embedding subset memberships into vector spaces, deriving theoretical bounds, and conducting empirical studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dimensional constraints and factors affecting embedding subset memberships for efficient retrieval tasks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Minimal Embeddable Dimension bounds and simulations using centroid embeddings.

Result: Identified tight MED bounds, simulated embedding achieving logarithmic dependency between MED and element number.

Conclusion: Embedding limitations for retrieval tasks are due to learnability challenges, guiding future algorithm designs.

Abstract: This paper studies the minimal dimension required to embed subset memberships ($m$ elements and ${m\choose k}$ subsets of at most $k$ elements) into vector spaces, denoted as Minimal Embeddable Dimension (MED). The tight bounds of MED are derived theoretically and supported empirically for various notions of "distances" or "similarities," including the $\ell_2$ metric, inner product, and cosine similarity. In addition, we conduct numerical simulation in a more achievable setting, where the ${m\choose k}$ subset embeddings are chosen as the centroid of the embeddings of the contained elements. Our simulation easily realizes a logarithmic dependency between the MED and the number of elements to embed. These findings imply that embedding-based retrieval limitations stem primarily from learnability challenges, not geometric constraints, guiding future algorithm design.

*Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov,Derya Umut Kulali,Taner Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PatchFormer introduces an efficient and effective foundation model for time series forecasting, significantly outperforming baselines across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of domain-specific feature engineering and reliance on substantial labeled data in time series forecasting.

Method: PatchFormer uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining, divides time series into patches for multiscale learning, and employs lightweight adapters for efficient transfer.

Result: It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across 24 datasets, reducing MSE by 27.3% compared to baselines and significantly reducing task-specific training requirements.

Conclusion: PatchFormer provides a scalable and efficient approach for time series forecasting with minimal task-specific data requirements and faster processing capabilities.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem with applications in climate, energy, healthcare, and finance. Many existing approaches require domain-specific feature engineering and substantial labeled data for each task. We introduce PatchFormer, a patch-based time series foundation model that uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining and lightweight adapters for efficient transfer. PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.

### [304] [Post-Training Fairness Control: A Single-Train Framework for Dynamic Fairness in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20848)
*Weixin Chen,Li Chen,Yuhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cofair, a framework for post-training fairness control in recommender systems, eliminating the need for retraining with diverse fairness requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness-aware methods for recommender systems lack flexibility after training, making it hard to adapt to diverse stakeholders' fairness demands without retraining.

Method: Cofair employs a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules for varied fairness levels and introduces a user-level regularization term to ensure monotonic fairness improvements.

Result: Experiments across datasets and models show that Cofair provides dynamic fairness control, maintaining or surpassing state-of-the-art fairness-accuracy trade-offs without retraining.

Conclusion: Cofair successfully addresses the challenge of adaptable fairness control in recommendation, offering a practical and effective solution for dynamic fairness customization.

Abstract: Despite growing efforts to mitigate unfairness in recommender systems, existing fairness-aware methods typically fix the fairness requirement at training time and provide limited post-training flexibility. However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/weixinchen98/Cofair.

### [305] [Exploring Transformer Placement in Variational Autoencoders for Tabular Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20854)
*Aníbal Silva,Moisés Santos,André Restivo,Carlos Soares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Integrating Transformers into different components of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for tabular data shows potential in improving its modeling capability but with trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of generative models, specifically VAEs, on tabular data by addressing their limitations in modeling relationships between mixed data types.

Method: The paper explores integrating Transformers into various parts of a VAE and evaluates the models using 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite.

Result: Findings highlight that using Transformers leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity, and demonstrates that blocks of a Transformer show high similarity with near-linear input-output relationships in the decoder.

Conclusion: Incorporating Transformers into VAEs can enhance their ability to model complex relationships in tabular data, albeit with noted trade-offs in performance characteristics.

Abstract: Tabular data remains a challenging domain for generative models. In particular, the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, typically composed of multilayer perceptrons, struggles to model relationships between features, especially when handling mixed data types. In contrast, Transformers, through their attention mechanism, are better suited for capturing complex feature interactions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Second, we observe a high similarity between consecutive blocks of a Transformer in all components. In particular, in the decoder, the relationship between the input and output of a Transformer is approximately linear.

### [306] [Colored Markov Modulated Fluid Queues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20537)
*Benny Van Houdt*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the Markov-modulated fluid queue (MMFQ) framework by introducing colored MMFQs, enhancing their modeling flexibility for analyzing performance in systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of classical MMFQs and enable analysis of queueing systems that suffer from dimensionality issues.

Method: Introduced colored MMFQs and colored MMFQs with fluid jumps to incorporate additional memory and flexibility in monitoring events.

Result: Enhanced flexibility allows for analyzing systems with complex dynamics that were previously intractable under classical methods.

Conclusion: The colored MMFQ framework provides a robust tool to model and analyze more complex systems, overcoming traditional limitations in MMFQ modeling.

Abstract: Markov-modulated fluid queues (MMFQs) are a powerful modeling framework for analyzing the performance of computer and communication systems. Their distinguishing feature is that the underlying Markov process evolves on a continuous state space, making them well suited to capture the dynamics of workloads, energy levels, and other performance-related quantities. Although classical MMFQs do not permit jumps in the fluid level, they can still be applied to analyze a wide range of jump processes.
  In this paper, we generalize the MMFQ framework in a new direction by introducing {\bf colored MMFQs} and {\bf colored MMFQs with fluid jumps}. This enriched framework provides an additional form of memory: the color of incoming fluid can be used to keep track of the fluid level when certain events took place. This capability greatly enhances modeling flexibility and enables the analysis of queueing systems that would otherwise be intractable due to the curse of dimensionality or state-space explosion.

TL;DR: This paper studies the Multiserver-Job Queuing Model (MJQM) using stochastic methods and develops algorithms for sample generation and stability estimation, with applications to complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim of this work is to better understand the behavior and performance of MJQMs and develop efficient methods to evaluate and ensure their stability, thereby improving operation in queuing systems.

Method: The authors used stochastic recurrence equations (SREs), ergodic theory, and extensions of Loynes' theorem to analyze MJQM. They developed algorithms leveraging GPU parallelization for workload sampling and stability estimation.

Result: Two algorithms were introduced: one for generating sub-perfect samples of workload (utilizing GPU parallelization) and another for estimating system stability conditions effectively. This method was shown to work for typed resources in complex systems.

Conclusion: The study provides a deeper theoretical understanding of MJQM stability while offering computational tools to optimize performance evaluation and extend its applicability to diverse systems.

Abstract: We study the Multiserver-Job Queuing Model (MJQM) with general independent arrivals and service times under FCFS scheduling, using stochastic recurrence equations (SREs) and ergodic theory. We prove the monotonicity and separability properties of the MJQM SRE, enabling the application of the monotone-separable extension of Loynes' theorem and the formal definition of the MJQM stability condition. Based on these results, we introduce and implement two algorithms: one for drawing sub-perfect samples (SPS) of the system's workload and the second one to estimate the system's stability condition given the statistics of the jobs' input stream. The SPS algorithm allows for a massive GPU parallelization, greatly improving the efficiency of performance metrics evaluation. We also show that this approach extends to more complex systems, including MJQMs with typed resources.

### [308] [E2HiL: Entropy-Guided Sample Selection for Efficient Real-World Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19969)
*Haoyuan Deng,Yuanjiang Xue,Haoyang Du,Boyang Zhou,Zhenyu Wu,Ziwei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) framework named \method, designed to improve sample efficiency and reduce human interventions during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study highlights the need to enhance HiL-RL frameworks for complex real-world manipulation tasks, as existing methods demand high human involvement, leading to increased labor costs and inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed framework actively selects informative samples by leveraging influence functions based on policy entropy reduction, pruning ineffective shortcut and noisy samples for a stable exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Result: \method demonstrated a 42.1% higher success rate and 10.1% fewer human interventions compared to the state-of-the-art HiL-RL methods in experiments across four manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: This approach validates the potential of \method for reducing human interventions and enhancing the efficiency of human-in-the-loop RL frameworks, making it suitable for complex real-world applications.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop guidance has emerged as an effective approach for enabling faster convergence in online reinforcement learning (RL) of complex real-world manipulation tasks. However, existing human-in-the-loop RL (HiL-RL) frameworks often suffer from low sample efficiency, requiring substantial human interventions to achieve convergence and thereby leading to high labor costs. To address this, we propose a sample-efficient real-world human-in-the-loop RL framework named \method, which requires fewer human intervention by actively selecting informative samples. Specifically, stable reduction of policy entropy enables improved trade-off between exploration and exploitation with higher sample efficiency. We first build influence functions of different samples on the policy entropy, which is efficiently estimated by the covariance of action probabilities and soft advantages of policies. Then we select samples with moderate values of influence functions, where shortcut samples that induce sharp entropy drops and noisy samples with negligible effect are pruned. Extensive experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that \method achieves a 42.1\% higher success rate while requiring 10.1\% fewer human interventions compared to the state-of-the-art HiL-RL method, validating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The JIT* algorithm enhances robotic path planning by addressing high-dimensional, complex environments' challenges, dynamically refining connectivity, and improving motion efficiency and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sampling-based methods struggle with efficiency in high-dimensional spaces, especially for robotic manipulators, due to complications like kinematic singularities and self-collisions.

Method: The JIT* algorithm introduces two modules: the 'Just-in-Time' module for adaptive edge connectivity and sampling density, and the 'Motion Performance' module for balancing manipulability and trajectory cost.

Result: JIT* consistently outperforms traditional planners in dimensions ranging from $\mathbb{R}^4$ to $\mathbb{R}^{16}$, with superior performance in single-arm and dual-arm robotic tasks.

Conclusion: JIT* advances robotic path planning by optimizing for speed, safety, and efficiency, with broad applicability in high-dimensional robotic tasks.

Abstract: In high-dimensional robotic path planning, traditional sampling-based methods often struggle to efficiently identify both feasible and optimal paths in complex, multi-obstacle environments. This challenge is intensified in robotic manipulators, where the risk of kinematic singularities and self-collisions further complicates motion efficiency and safety. To address these issues, we introduce the Just-in-Time Informed Trees (JIT*) algorithm, an enhancement over Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), designed to improve path planning through two core modules: the Just-in-Time module and the Motion Performance module. The Just-in-Time module includes "Just-in-Time Edge," which dynamically refines edge connectivity, and "Just-in-Time Sample," which adjusts sampling density in bottleneck areas to enable faster initial path discovery. The Motion Performance module balances manipulability and trajectory cost through dynamic switching, optimizing motion control while reducing the risk of singularities. Comparative analysis shows that JIT* consistently outperforms traditional sampling-based planners across $\mathbb{R}^4$ to $\mathbb{R}^{16}$ dimensions. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated in single-arm and dual-arm manipulation tasks, with experimental results available in a video at https://youtu.be/nL1BMHpMR7c.

*Haoxuan Wang,Gengyu Zhang,Yan Yan,Yuzhang Shang,Ramana Rao Kompella,Gaowen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents REMAC, a method to enhance robot manipulation in dynamic environments by addressing intra-chunk inconsistency and improving inter-chunk continuity during asynchronous inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize real-time robot manipulation efficiency by resolving execution failures caused by mismatches between intended actions and actual robotic execution.

Method: REMAC employs masked action chunking to learn corrective adjustments in the pretrained policy and introduces prefix-preserved sampling to ensure inter-chunk continuity.

Result: REMAC improves task execution speed, robustness under delays, and completion rates based on experiments in simulated and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method delivers more reliable robot manipulation policies without additional latency, enhancing performance in real-world environments.

Abstract: Real-time execution is essential for cyber-physical systems such as robots. These systems operate in dynamic real-world environments where even small delays can undermine responsiveness and compromise performance. Asynchronous inference has recently emerged as a system-level paradigm for real-time robot manipulation, enabling the next action chunk to be predicted while the current one is being executed. While this approach achieves real-time responsiveness, naive integration often results in execution failure. Previous methods attributed this failure to inter-chunk discontinuity and developed test-time algorithms to smooth chunk boundaries. In contrast, we identify another critical yet overlooked factor: intra-chunk inconsistency, where the robot's executed action chunk partially misaligns with its current perception. To address this, we propose REMAC, which learns corrective adjustments on the pretrained policy through masked action chunking, enabling the policy to remain resilient under mismatches between intended actions and actual execution during asynchronous inference. In addition, we introduce a prefix-preserved sampling procedure to reinforce inter-chunk continuity. Overall, our method delivers more reliable policies without incurring additional latency. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method enables faster task execution, maintains robustness across varying delays, and consistently achieves higher completion rates.

*Muzaffar Qureshi,Tochukwu Elijah Ogri,Kyle Volle,Rushikesh Kamalapurkar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses inaccuracies in Gaussian Process models caused by imperfect localization in mobile robots and proposes a second-order correction algorithm using the kernel's differentiability, achieving efficient real-time refinements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications of scalar field mapping using mobile robots face challenges due to location uncertainty, degrading Gaussian Process predictions.

Method: The authors propose leveraging the kernel function's differentiability to develop a second-order correction algorithm using precomputed Jacobians and Hessians for real-time GP model refinement.

Result: Simulation experiments showed significant prediction accuracy improvements and computational efficiency over full model retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively refines GP models under localization uncertainty, optimizing real-world applications with mobile robots.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric Bayesian models for regression of scalar fields, formulated under the assumption that measurement locations are perfectly known and the corresponding field measurements have Gaussian noise. However, many real-world scalar field mapping applications rely on sensor-equipped mobile robots to collect field measurements, where imperfect localization introduces state uncertainty. Such discrepancies between the estimated and true measurement locations degrade GP mean and covariance estimates. To address this challenge, we propose a method for updating the GP models when improved estimates become available. Leveraging the differentiability of the kernel function, a second-order correction algorithm is developed using the precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of the GP mean and covariance functions for real-time refinement based on measurement location discrepancy data. Simulation results demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full model retraining.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRACER, a framework addressing challenges in robotic manipulation of deformable objects via hierarchical semantic reasoning and functional region refinement to improve handling precision and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation faces challenges in aligning semantic instructions with physical interactions in deformable objects due to infinite degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and appearance variations.

Method: The proposed TRACER framework utilizes a Tree-structured Affordance Chain-of-Thought for semantic decomposition, a Spatial-Constrained Boundary Refinement to ensure prediction accuracy, and an Interactive Convergence Refinement Flow for enhancing spatial and physical plausibility.

Result: TRACER demonstrates improved affordance grounding precision and higher success rates in long-horizon tasks through experiments on the Fine-AGDDO15 dataset and a real-world robotic system.

Conclusion: TRACER bridges the gap between high-level task reasoning and physical manipulation, providing robust and precise functionality. Code and dataset are made publicly available.

Abstract: The central challenge in robotic manipulation of deformable objects lies in aligning high-level semantic instructions with physical interaction points under complex appearance and texture variations. Due to near-infinite degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and heterogeneous patterns, existing vision-based affordance prediction methods often suffer from boundary overflow and fragmented functional regions. To address these issues, we propose TRACER, a Texture-Robust Affordance Chain-of-thought with dEformable-object Refinement framework, which establishes a cross-hierarchical mapping from hierarchical semantic reasoning to appearance-robust and physically consistent functional region refinement. Specifically, a Tree-structured Affordance Chain-of-Thought (TA-CoT) is formulated to decompose high-level task intentions into hierarchical sub-task semantics, providing consistent guidance across various execution stages. To ensure spatial integrity, a Spatial-Constrained Boundary Refinement (SCBR) mechanism is introduced to suppress prediction spillover, guiding the perceptual response to converge toward authentic interaction manifolds. Furthermore, an Interactive Convergence Refinement Flow (ICRF) is developed to aggregate discrete pixels corrupted by appearance noise, significantly enhancing the spatial continuity and physical plausibility of the identified functional regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the Fine-AGDDO15 dataset and a real-world robotic platform demonstrate that TRACER significantly improves affordance grounding precision across diverse textures and patterns inherent to deformable objects. More importantly, it enhances the success rate of long-horizon tasks, effectively bridging the gap between high-level semantic reasoning and low-level physical execution. The source code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Dikay1/TRACER.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TouchGuide is a novel visuo-tactile fusion paradigm that improves robot manipulation by integrating visual and tactile inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle with fine-grained, contact-rich tasks because they often underutilize tactile feedback. This paper aims to enhance performance by combining vision and touch in a novel way.

Method: TouchGuide operates in two steps: first, a visual policy suggests coarse actions, and second, tactile feedback refines these actions using a Contact Physical Model trained with limited expert demonstrations. Data collection is supported by TacUMI, a low-cost tactile feedback system.

Result: Experimental results on tasks like shoe lacing and chip handover demonstrate that TouchGuide surpasses state-of-the-art methods in visuo-tactile manipulation.

Conclusion: TouchGuide effectively leverages visuo-tactile fusion and tactile feedback, achieving superior robotic manipulation in complex tasks through a cost-effective data collection approach.

Abstract: Fine-grained and contact-rich manipulation remain challenging for robots, largely due to the underutilization of tactile feedback. To address this, we introduce TouchGuide, a novel cross-policy visuo-tactile fusion paradigm that fuses modalities within a low-dimensional action space. Specifically, TouchGuide operates in two stages to guide a pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching visuomotor policy at inference time. First, the policy produces a coarse, visually-plausible action using only visual inputs during early sampling. Second, a task-specific Contact Physical Model (CPM) provides tactile guidance to steer and refine the action, ensuring it aligns with realistic physical contact conditions. Trained through contrastive learning on limited expert demonstrations, the CPM provides a tactile-informed feasibility score to steer the sampling process toward refined actions that satisfy physical contact constraints. Furthermore, to facilitate TouchGuide training with high-quality and cost-effective data, we introduce TacUMI, a data collection system. TacUMI achieves a favorable trade-off between precision and affordability; by leveraging rigid fingertips, it obtains direct tactile feedback, thereby enabling the collection of reliable tactile data. Extensive experiments on five challenging contact-rich tasks, such as shoe lacing and chip handover, show that TouchGuide consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visuo-tactile policies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shallow-pi, a knowledge distillation framework to reduce transformer depth in vision-language-action models, enabling faster inference with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for real-time robotic tasks requires faster, efficient, and on-device inference for VLA models, but transformer layer reduction remains underexplored, especially in flow-based VLA models with knowledge distillation.

Method: The authors developed Shallow-pi, a knowledge distillation framework that reduces transformer layers from 18 to 6 in both the VLM backbone and flow-based action head, without significant performance degradation.

Result: Shallow-pi achieves more than twice faster inference with less than 1% absolute drop in success rate on manipulation benchmarks, setting a new standard among reduced VLA models.

Conclusion: Shallow-pi demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reduced VLA models and was validated through real-world industrial experiments on various robot platforms with complex and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: The growing demand for real-time robotic deployment necessitates fast and on-device inference for vision-language-action (VLA) models. Within the VLA literature, efficiency has been extensively studied at the token level, such as visual token pruning. In contrast, systematic transformer layer reduction has received limited attention and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored for flow-based VLA models under knowledge distillation. In this work, we propose Shallow-pi, a principled knowledge distillation framework that aggressively reduces the transformer depth of both the VLM backbone and the flow-based action head, compressing the model from 18 to 6 layers. Shallow-pi achieves over two times faster inference with less than one percent absolute drop in success rate on standard manipulation benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance among reduced VLA models. Crucially, we validate our approach through industrial-scale real-world experiments on Jetson Orin and Jetson Thor across multiple robot platforms, including humanoid systems, in complex and dynamic manipulation scenarios.

*Yuzhe Huang,Pei Lin,Wanlin Li,Daohan Li,Jiajun Li,Jiaming Jiang,Chenxi Xiao,Ziyuan Jiao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces TaF-VLA, a Vision-Language-Action framework addressing the lack of physical intuition by incorporating tactile-force alignment, enabling superior performance in contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models lack physical reasoning and force regulation due to a reliance on visual inputs in tasks requiring precise physical interaction.

Method: The authors propose TaF-VLA, which uses a Tactile-Force Adapter to align tactile sensory data with interaction forces, utilizing a novel dataset (TaF-Dataset) with over 10 million data points for training.

Result: TaF-VLA outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in real-world tests of contact-heavy tasks, showcasing robust and force-aware manipulative performance.

Conclusion: By shifting from tactile-vision to tactile-force alignment, TaF-VLA demonstrates the critical role of integrating physical force reasoning into robotic manipulation systems for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful generalists for robotic manipulation. However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that TaF-VLA policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tactile-vision-aligned and vision-only baselines on contact-rich tasks, verifying its ability to achieve robust, force-aware manipulation through cross-modal physical reasoning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates using a general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent framework for robotic manipulation tasks without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. It achieves high success rates across benchmarks, showcasing its potential for autonomous exploration and training data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether general-purpose LLM agent frameworks, initially created for software engineering, can be effective in embodied robotic manipulation tasks that typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning.

Method: The paper introduces FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), applying an unmodified LLM agent framework (Claude Agent SDK) to embodied manipulation. Iterative reasoning is used for generating manipulation strategies, and benchmarks LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld were evaluated with privileged state access.

Result: FAEA achieved success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96% respectively on these benchmarks without demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback, performance improved to 88.2%.

Conclusion: FAEA shows that general-purpose agents can handle a class of robotic manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning, enabling autonomous exploration and benefiting robotics systems through state-of-the-art agent infrastructures.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

TL;DR: RF-MatID is the first open-source, large-scale RF dataset designed for fine-grained material identification and benchmarking. It spans 16 material categories, incorporates diverse geometry variations, and utilizes deep learning frameworks for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-based material identification approaches face limitations due to optical sensor constraints, while RF approaches offer potential through material property revelation. However, RF-based identification lacks extensive datasets and benchmarks.

Method: The RF-MatID dataset includes 142k RF samples across a frequency range of 4 to 43.5 GHz with variations in angle and distance. It provides controlled data and evaluates deep learning models for material identification under diverse conditions.

Result: RF-MatID establishes benchmarks for multi-setting protocols, ensuring robust material identification. It highlights in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness and facilitates systematic frequency analysis.

Conclusion: RF-MatID supports reproducible research, algorithmic enhancement, cross-domain robustness, and real-world applications in RF-based material identification.

Abstract: Accurate material identification plays a crucial role in embodied AI systems, enabling a wide range of applications. However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment. RF-MatID aims to enable reproducible research, accelerate algorithmic advancement, foster cross-domain robustness, and support the development of real-world application in RF-based material identification.

*Alexandre Chapin,Emmanuel Dellandréa,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: STORM introduces lightweight object-centric modules to augment visual foundation models for robotic manipulation, achieving improved robustness and control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of dense visual foundation model representations in providing explicit object-level structure for robust robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: visual--semantic pretraining stabilizes object-centric slots using language embeddings, followed by joint adaptation with a manipulation policy to align perception with task goals.

Result: STORM enhances object discovery and generalization in simulated robotic manipulation tasks compared to using frozen foundation model features or end-to-end trained object-centric representations.

Conclusion: Multi-phase adaptation efficiently transforms generic visual features into task-aware representations, providing significant benefits in robotic manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: Visual foundation models provide strong perceptual features for robotics, but their dense representations lack explicit object-level structure, limiting robustness and contractility in manipulation tasks. We propose STORM (Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation), a lightweight object-centric adaptation module that augments frozen visual foundation models with a small set of semantic-aware slots for robotic manipulation. Rather than retraining large backbones, STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: object-centric slots are first stabilized through visual--semantic pretraining using language embeddings, then jointly adapted with a downstream manipulation policy. This staged learning prevents degenerate slot formation and preserves semantic consistency while aligning perception with task objectives. Experiments on object discovery benchmarks and simulated manipulation tasks show that STORM improves generalization to visual distractors, and control performance compared to directly using frozen foundation model features or training object-centric representations end-to-end. Our results highlight multi-phase adaptation as an efficient mechanism for transforming generic foundation model features into task-aware object-centric representations for robotic control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework of key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate robotic lunar prospecting in multi-robot field trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of standardized, science-driven evaluation metrics for robotic lunar exploration under varied terrains and conditions.

Method: The authors developed a framework of KPIs based on scientific objectives and operational constraints across three multi-robot lunar scenarios, emphasizing priorities like efficiency, robustness, and precision.

Result: The framework was validated in multi-robot field tests, proving practical for efficiency and robustness KPIs but revealing challenges in precision KPIs due to difficulties in obtaining reliable ground-truth data.

Conclusion: The proposed KPI framework serves as a standardized approach for comparing multi-robot field trials and guiding the development of robotic systems for planetary exploration.

Abstract: Robotic prospecting for critical resources on the Moon, such as ilmenite, rare earth elements, and water ice, requires robust exploration methods given the diverse terrain and harsh environmental conditions. Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments. Overall, we propose this framework as a common evaluation standard enabling consistent, goal-oriented comparison of multi-robot field trials and supporting systematic development of robotic systems for future planetary exploration.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an affordable method for accurate tactile sensing in robotics using piezoelectric microphones and vibrational signal decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the cost and integration challenges of traditional tactile sensing methods for robotic manipulation.

Method: The method employs seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones to capture vibrational signals and utilizes an Audio Spectrogram Transformer for touch localization.

Result: Experimental evaluations show a localization error under 5 mm in static tasks, robustness in dynamic tasks, and insights into material-specific responses.

Conclusion: Decoding vibrational signals can effectively enable scalable, affordable tactile sensing for robotics, with resources provided to support further research.

Abstract: Rich contact perception is crucial for robotic manipulation, yet traditional tactile skins remain expensive and complex to integrate. This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.

### [321] [MeCo: Enhancing LLM-Empowered Multi-Robot Collaboration via Similar Task Memoization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20577)
*Baiqing Wang,Helei Cui,Bo Zhang,Xiaolong Zheng,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MeCo is a framework for multi-robot collaboration that leverages task similarity recognition to optimize planning and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-robot collaboration methods require extensive task-specific training and lack adaptability to new scenarios. Current language model-based solutions replan inefficiently for similar tasks.

Method: MeCo incorporates a similarity-aware framework that uses 'cache and reuse' principles, allowing solution reuse for similar tasks through a new similarity testing method while avoiding repeated invocation of language models (LLMs).

Result: The framework reduces planning costs and boosts success rates significantly compared with existing methods. MeCoBench was introduced as the first benchmark for comparing performance in similar-task collaboration.

Conclusion: MeCo improves efficiency and effectiveness in multi-robot systems by introducing similarity testing for task reuse, thus enhancing adaptability and reducing redundant computation in planning.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems have been widely deployed in real-world applications, providing significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in labor costs. However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

### [322] [GPO: Growing Policy Optimization for Legged Robot Locomotion and Whole-Body Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20668)
*Shuhao Liao,Peizhuo Li,Xinrong Yang,Linnan Chang,Zhaoxin Fan,Qing Wang,Lei Shi,Yuhong Cao,Wenjun Wu,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Growing Policy Optimization (GPO), a reinforcement learning framework for improving legged robot locomotion by progressively expanding the action space during training, achieving better performance with hardware-friendly torque-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in training reinforcement learning for legged robots due to high-dimensional actions, hardware constraints, and limited exploration, especially for torque-based control, which lacks effective exploration and gradient signals.

Method: The proposed GPO framework applies a time-varying action transformation that initially restricts the action space for effective learning and gradually expands it for better exploration. It maintains the PPO update rule with bounded gradient distortions, ensuring stable policy optimization.

Result: GPO shows superior performance in both quadruped and hexapod robot locomotion tasks. It also performs well in zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies directly onto hardware.

Conclusion: GPO offers a general and environment-independent framework for optimizing reinforcement learning and enhancing the locomotion abilities of legged robots.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) policies for legged robots remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous actions, hardware constraints, and limited exploration. Existing methods for locomotion and whole-body control work well for position-based control with environment-specific heuristics (e.g., reward shaping, curriculum design, and manual initialization), but are less effective for torque-based control, where sufficiently exploring the action space and obtaining informative gradient signals for training is significantly more difficult. We introduce Growing Policy Optimization (GPO), a training framework that applies a time-varying action transformation to restrict the effective action space in the early stage, thereby encouraging more effective data collection and policy learning, and then progressively expands it to enhance exploration and achieve higher expected return. We prove that this transformation preserves the PPO update rule and introduces only bounded, vanishing gradient distortion, thereby ensuring stable training. We evaluate GPO on both quadruped and hexapod robots, including zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on hardware. Policies trained with GPO consistently achieve better performance. These results suggest that GPO provides a general, environment-agnostic optimization framework for learning legged locomotion.

*Péter Polcz,Katalin Schäffer,Miklós Koller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to estimate joint positions in tendon-driven robotic hands using tendon data, enabling gesture tracking without direct joint sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of lacking direct joint position sensing in tendon-driven robotic hands without compromising their mechanical design.

Method: Developed a kinematic modeling framework and nonlinear optimization method to estimate joint angles from tendon displacements and tensions, integrated into a PI controller for closed-loop gesture tracking.

Result: The framework's feasibility and limitations were validated through MuJoCo simulations using an anatomically correct robotic hand model.

Conclusion: The approach enables effective joint position estimation and gesture control in robotic hands without needing direct joint angle sensors.

Abstract: Tendon-driven anthropomorphic robotic hands often lack direct joint angle sensing, as the integration of joint encoders can compromise mechanical compactness and dexterity. This paper presents a computational method for estimating joint positions from measured tendon displacements and tensions. An efficient kinematic modeling framework for anthropomorphic hands is first introduced based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. Using a simplified tendon model, a system of nonlinear equations relating tendon states to joint positions is derived and solved via a nonlinear optimization approach. The estimated joint angles are then employed for closed-loop control through a Jacobian-based proportional-integral (PI) controller augmented with a feedforward term, enabling gesture tracking without direct joint sensing. The effectiveness and limitations of the proposed estimation and control framework are demonstrated in the MuJoCo simulation environment using the Anatomically Correct Biomechatronic Hand, featuring five degrees of freedom for each long finger and six degrees of freedom for the thumb.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents Dispersive MeanFlow Policy Optimization (DMPO), a method for real-time robotic control enabling single-step action inference with high-speed performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic control techniques require multi-step inference, which limits their deployment in time-sensitive and high-performance scenarios.

Method: The method introduces DMPO, consisting of three major components: (1) MeanFlow for single-step inference, (2) dispersive regularization to avoid representation collapse, and (3) reinforcement learning fine-tuning to improve beyond expert demonstration capabilities.

Result: DMPO demonstrates superior or competitive performance in robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks, achieving significant inference speedups (5-20x) and supporting real-time control requirements (>120Hz).

Conclusion: DMPO is a robust approach that facilitates real-time robotic control, validated both in simulation and on physical hardware, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Real-time robotic control demands fast action generation. However, existing generative policies based on diffusion and flow matching require multi-step
  sampling, fundamentally limiting deployment in time-critical scenarios. We propose Dispersive MeanFlow Policy Optimization (DMPO), a unified framework that
  enables true one-step generation through three key components: MeanFlow for mathematically-derived single-step inference without knowledge distillation,
  dispersive regularization to prevent representation collapse, and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning to surpass expert demonstrations. Experiments
  across RoboMimic manipulation and OpenAI Gym locomotion benchmarks demonstrate competitive or superior performance compared to multi-step baselines. With
  our lightweight model architecture and the three key algorithmic components working in synergy, DMPO exceeds real-time control requirements (>120Hz) with
  5-20x inference speedup, reaching hundreds of Hertz on high-performance GPUs. Physical deployment on a Franka-Emika-Panda robot validates real-world
  applicability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a weakly supervised robotic manipulation framework that integrates calibration-aware depth perception with admittance control, reducing manual intervention and enhancing biomedical micromanipulation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving the reliability and accuracy of robotic manipulation under a microscope setting without the need for complex calibration setups or labor-intensive 2D labeling.

Method: The method involves utilizing reusable warm-up trajectories to extract spatial data, developing a calibration-aware perception system, and coupling this with admittance control for precise task execution. The system also quantifies task-space error using uncertainty budgets.

Result: The proposed system achieved 49 micrometers lateral accuracy and ≤291 micrometers depth accuracy at 95% confidence and reduced user workload by 77.1% compared to baseline methods in a user study.

Conclusion: The weakly supervised agent enhances accuracy and reduces setup complexity in biomedical micromanipulation, offering practical, efficient, and less labor-intensive interventions.

Abstract: This paper rethinks steady-hand robotic manipulation by using a weakly supervised framework that fuses calibration-aware perception with admittance control. Unlike conventional automation that relies on labor-intensive 2D labeling, our framework leverages reusable warm-up trajectories to extract implicit spatial information, thereby achieving calibration-aware, depth-resolved perception without the need for external fiducials or manual depth annotation. By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves. In a within-subject user study (N=8), the learned agent reduces overall NASA-TLX workload by 77.1% relative to the simple steady-hand assistance baseline. These results demonstrate that the weakly supervised agent improves the reliability of microscope-guided biomedical micromanipulation without introducing complex setup requirements, offering a practical framework for microscope-guided intervention.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for implementing knowledge graphs in ROS 2 systems, aiming to enhance the efficiency and intelligence of autonomous robotic missions. The methodology encompasses several key steps: defining initial and target conditions, structuring tasks and subtasks, planning their sequence, representing task-related data in a knowledge graph, and designing the mission using a high-level language. Each step builds on the previous one to ensure a cohesive process from initial setup to final execution. A practical implementation within the Aerostack2 framework is demonstrated through a simulated search and rescue mission in a Gazebo environment, where drones autonomously locate a target.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to facilitate the transfer of reinforcement learning (RL) policies from simulation to the real world by leveraging neural style transfer to generate training data from unlabelled real-world datasets, improving the physical realism of RL applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of transferring RL policies trained in simulated environments to real-world scenarios, given the domain gap and limited availability of real-world data.

Method: The method uses a variational autoencoder for neural style transfer on training data. It employs self-supervised feature representation learning and generates weakly paired source-target trajectories to enhance physical realism during RL policy training.

Result: This approach was applied to robot cutting tasks with unknown materials, showing improvements in task completion time, behavioural stability, and robustness compared to prior methods, with minimal reliance on real-world data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of the proposed RL transfer method, especially for complex tasks like contact-rich environments, by bridging the gap between simulation and real-world systems.

Abstract: Whereas reinforcement learning has been applied with success to a range of robotic control problems in complex, uncertain environments, reliance on extensive data - typically sourced from simulation environments - limits real-world deployment due to the domain gap between simulated and physical systems, coupled with limited real-world sample availability. We propose a novel method for sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning policies, based on a reinterpretation of neural style transfer from image processing to synthesise novel training data from unpaired unlabelled real world datasets. We employ a variational autoencoder to jointly learn self-supervised feature representations for style transfer and generate weakly paired source-target trajectories to improve physical realism of synthesised trajectories. We demonstrate the application of our approach based on the case study of robot cutting of unknown materials. Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data. Our framework demonstrates robustness to geometric and material variation, and highlights the feasibility of policy adaptation in challenging contact-rich tasks where real-world reward information is unavailable.

*Darshan Deshpande,Anand Kannappan,Rebecca Qian*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for testing reward hacking in code-based RL environments, and identifies strengths and weaknesses in current model capabilities for anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust evaluation for reward hacking detection when leveraging LLMs as evaluators in reinforcement learning for code generation.

Method: The authors created TRACE, a benchmark of 517 curated testing trajectories spanning 54 reward exploit categories, and evaluated model detection of reward anomalies in both isolated classification setups and contrastive anomaly detection setups.

Result: In contrastive settings, models, like GPT-5.2, achieved higher reward hack detection rates (63%) compared to isolated settings (45%), but struggled more with semantically contextualized reward hacks than syntactic ones.

Conclusion: This study emphasizes the need for better methods to detect semantically contextualized reward hacks and provides a foundation (TRACE) for the community to improve and evaluate detection models.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for code generation have made robust environments essential to prevent reward hacking. As LLMs increasingly serve as evaluators in code-based RL, their ability to detect reward hacking remains understudied. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of reward exploits spanning across 54 categories and introduce TRACE (Testing Reward Anomalies in Code Environments), a synthetically curated and human-verified benchmark containing 517 testing trajectories. Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with a more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best detection rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models struggle significantly more with semantically contextualized reward hacks compared to syntactically contextualized ones. We further conduct qualitative analyses of model behaviors, as well as ablation studies showing that the ratio of benign to hacked trajectories and analysis cluster sizes substantially impact detection performance. We release the benchmark and evaluation harness to enable the community to expand TRACE and evaluate their models.

*Shamse Tasnim Cynthia,Joy Krishan Das,Banani Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores how core and peripheral developers interact with autonomous coding agents in the software development process, analyzing over 9,000 agent-generated pull requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear dynamics in collaboration with autonomous AI agents for coding among core and peripheral developers.

Method: Empirical study of 9,427 agent-generated pull requests using qualitative and quantitative analysis to examine usage, review, modification, and verification patterns.

Result: Peripheral developers use agents across various tasks more evenly, while core developers focus on documentation and testing with higher merge rates. Core developers engage more in review discussions, agentic PRs are less frequently modified, and peripheral developers often merge without verification.

Conclusion: Insights highlight differences in collaboration patterns with coding agents between core and peripheral developers, offering strategies for effective integration with AI tools.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents are transforming software development and redefining how developers collaborate with AI. Prior research shows that the adoption and use of AI-powered tools differ between core and peripheral developers. However, it remains unclear how this dynamic unfolds in the emerging era of autonomous coding agents. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of 9,427 agentic PRs, examining how core and peripheral developers use, review, modify, and verify agent-generated contributions prior to acceptance. Through a mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis, we make four key contributions. First, a subset of peripheral developers use agents more often, delegating tasks evenly across bug fixing, feature addition, documentation, and testing. In contrast, core developers focus more on documentation and testing, yet their agentic PRs are frequently merged into the main/master branch. Second, core developers engage slightly more in review discussions than peripheral developers, and both groups focus on evolvability issues. Third, agentic PRs are less likely to be modified, but when they are, both groups commonly perform refactoring. Finally, peripheral developers are more likely to merge without running CI checks, whereas core developers more consistently require passing verification before acceptance. Our analysis offers a comprehensive view of how developer experience shapes integration offer insights for both peripheral and core developers on how to effectively collaborate with coding agents.

*Shamse Tasnim Cynthia,Al Muttakin,Banani Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the post-merge code quality of AI agent-generated pull requests (PRs), discovering that larger PRs contribute to code issues despite merge success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the post-merge code quality of AI-generated PRs, as prior research mainly used controlled benchmarks and did not focus on real-world analyses.

Method: The study analyzed 1,210 AI-generated merged bug-fix PRs from Python repositories using SonarQube to track changes in code quality, including issue frequency and severity across agents.

Result: The study found that merge success does not equate to good post-merge quality, with higher issue counts linked to PR size and a significant presence of critical and major code smells.

Conclusion: Systematic quality checks are crucial for validating merge quality of agent-generated bug-fix PRs, as merge success is not a reliable indicator of code quality.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of AI coding agents has increased the number of agent-generated pull requests (PRs) merged with little or no human intervention. Although such PRs promise productivity gains, their post-merge code quality remains underexplored, as prior work has largely relied on benchmarks and controlled tasks rather than large-scale post-merge analyses. To address this gap, we analyze 1,210 merged agent-generated bug-fix PRs from Python repositories in the AIDev dataset. Using SonarQube, we perform a differential analysis between base and merged commits to identify code quality issues newly introduced by PR changes. We examine issue frequency, density, severity, and rule-level prevalence across five agents. Our results show that apparent differences in raw issue counts across agents largely disappear after normalizing by code churn, indicating that higher issue counts are primarily driven by larger PRs. Across all agents, code smells dominate, particularly at critical and major severities, while bugs are less frequent but often severe. Overall, our findings show that merge success does not reliably reflect post-merge code quality, highlighting the need for systematic quality checks for agent-generated bug-fix PRs.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of automated techniques and tools for supporting various software engineering tasks, e.g., program understanding, code generation, software testing, and program repair. As CodeLLMs are being employed toward automating these tasks, one question that arises, especially in enterprise settings, is whether these coding assistants and the code LLMs that power them are ready for real-world projects and enterprise use cases, and how do they impact the existing software engineering process and user experience. In this paper we survey 57 developers from different domains and with varying software engineering skill about their experience with AI coding assistants and CodeLLMs. We also reviewed 35 user surveys on the usage, experience and expectations of professionals and students using AI coding assistants and CodeLLMs. Based on our study findings and analysis of existing surveys, we discuss the requirements for AI-powered coding assistants.

*Saima Afrin,Zaiyu Cheng,Tushar Sharma,Alexander Serebrenik,Massimiliano Di Penta,Antonio Mastropaolo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores how system prompts, model scale, and programming language impact the performance of instruction-tuned Language Models (ILMs) and Code Language Models (CLMs) in code generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the underexplored aspect of how system prompts influence the performance of ILMs and CLMs in code generation, considering their importance in modern AI systems.

Method: Systematic evaluation of ILMs and CLMs under varying system prompt details, model scales, prompting strategies (zero-shot vs few-shot), and programming languages, analyzing 120 model configurations.

Result: Findings reveal that larger models are more affected by system prompts, few-shot prompting reduces the prompt's impact, and programming languages differ in sensitivity to prompt variations (Java shows greater sensitivity than Python).

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of system prompts, model strategies, and programming languages when optimizing code generation, providing insights to enhance the performance of ILMs and CLMs.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Language Models ILMs have become essential components of modern AI systems, demonstrating exceptional versatility across a wide range of natural language and reasoning tasks. Among their most impactful applications is code generation, where ILMs--commonly referred to as Code Language Models CLMs--have demonstrated remarkable capability. This strength stems from their defining feature: the use of explicit task instructions during fine-tuning, which enables them to bridge natural language and code by translating human intent into executable code. While much of their progress has been driven by advances in scaling laws and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored--the impact of system prompts on the performance of both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs when instantiated to assist users with code generation activities. In this study, we take a first step toward bridging this gap by systematically evaluating how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect ILMs and CLMs in code generation tasks. Our evaluation framework, spanning 120 model configurations, reveals that (1) the influence of system prompts increases with model scale; (2) few-shot prompting reduces this effect compared to zero-shot; and (3) programming language matters, with Java showing greater sensitivity to system prompt variations than Python.

### [334] [LogSieve: Task-Aware CI Log Reduction for Sustainable LLM-Based Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20148)
*Marcus Emmanuel Barnes,Taher A. Ghaleb,Safwat Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LogSieve is a lightweight log reduction technique for Continuous Integration (CI) workflows, reducing verbose and noisy logs by filtering low-information lines while retaining semantically important content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The excessive volume and verbosity of CI logs make manual and automated log analyses challenging, costly, and environmentally unsustainable.

Method: LogSieve applies RCA-aware techniques and embedding-based classifiers to filter CI logs, achieving substantial log reduction without losing semantic or categorical information.

Result: Tested on CI logs from 20 open-source Android projects, LogSieve reduced lines by 42% and tokens by 40%, retaining high semantic fidelity (Cosine = 0.93, GPTScore = 0.93).

Conclusion: LogSieve enables efficient and greener log management, reducing computational and environmental costs while ensuring interpretability and semantic accuracy in CI workflows.

Abstract: Logs are essential for understanding Continuous Integration (CI) behavior, particularly for diagnosing build failures and performance regressions. Yet their growing volume and verbosity make both manual inspection and automated analysis increasingly costly, time-consuming, and environmentally costly. While prior work has explored log compression, anomaly detection, and LLM-based log analysis, most efforts target structured system logs rather than the unstructured, noisy, and verbose logs typical of CI workflows.
  We present LogSieve, a lightweight, RCA-aware and semantics-preserving log reduction technique that filters low-information lines while retaining content relevant to downstream reasoning. Evaluated on CI logs from 20 open-source Android projects using GitHub Actions, LogSieve achieves an average 42% reduction in lines and 40% reduction in tokens with minimal semantic loss. This pre-inference reduction lowers computational cost and can proportionally reduce energy use (and associated emissions) by decreasing the volume of data processed during LLM inference.
  Compared with structure-first baselines (LogZip and random-line removal), LogSieve preserves much higher semantic and categorical fidelity (Cosine = 0.93, GPTScore = 0.93, 80% exact-match accuracy). Embedding-based classifiers automate relevance detection with near-human accuracy (97%), enabling scalable and sustainable integration of semantics-aware filtering into CI workflows. LogSieve thus bridges log management and LLM reasoning, offering a practical path toward greener and more interpretable CI automation.

### [335] [Cascaded Vulnerability Attacks in Software Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20158)
*Laura Baird,Armin Moin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel, graph-based approach for analyzing security vulnerabilities in software supply chains, addressing the limitations of treating them in isolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of traditional software security tools that analyze vulnerabilities in isolation, enabling better detection of cascaded threats across software supply chains and resolving inconsistency in downstream SBOM-driven vulnerability analyses.

Method: The authors propose modeling enriched Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) as heterogeneous graphs, employing a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) to predict vulnerabilities, and using link prediction via multi-layer perceptron networks for modeling cascaded vulnerability chains.

Result: The HGAT component classifier achieved an accuracy of 91.03% and an F1-score of 74.02%, and the link prediction approach identifies ranked candidate links for composing multi-step vulnerability paths.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the understanding and detection of complex software security vulnerabilities, offering a more holistic analysis framework to identify cascaded threats leveraging SBOMs.

Abstract: Most of the current software security analysis tools assess vulnerabilities in isolation. However, sophisticated software supply chain security threats often stem from cascaded vulnerability and security weakness chains that span dependent components. Moreover, although the adoption of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) has been accelerating, downstream vulnerability findings vary substantially across SBOM generators and analysis tools. We propose a novel approach to SBOM-driven security analysis methods and tools. We model vulnerability relationships over dependency structure rather than treating scanner outputs as independent records. We represent enriched SBOMs as heterogeneous graphs with nodes being the SBOM components and dependencies, the known software vulnerabilities, and the known software security weaknesses. We then train a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) to predict whether a component is associated with at least one known vulnerability. Since documented multi-vulnerability chains are scarce, we model cascade discovery as a link prediction problem over CVE pairs using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. This way, we produce ranked candidate links that can be composed into multi-step paths. The HGAT component classifier achieves an Accuracy of 91.03% and an F1-score of 74.02%.

### [336] [How do Agents Refactor: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20160)
*Lukas Ottenhof,Daniel Penner,Abram Hindle,Thibaud Lutellier*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the performance of software development agents in Java refactoring, comparing them to human developers. It finds significant differences in refactoring types and reveals that only Cursor statistically increases refactoring smells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in understanding how software development agents perform in Java refactoring, the changes made, and their impact on code quality.

Method: The authors analyze agentic refactoring pull requests in Java across 86 projects per group using tools like RefactoringMiner and DesigniteJava 3.0 to examine refactoring types and detect code smells.

Result: Agent refactorings focus mainly on annotation changes, contrasting with developers who implement diverse structural improvements. Among agents, only Cursor shows a statistically significant increase in refactoring smells.

Conclusion: Agent refactorings differ substantially from developer refactorings, primarily focusing on annotations rather than broader improvements. Cursor uniquely shows a negative impact on code quality.

Abstract: Software development agents such as Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor Agent, Devin, and OpenAI Codex are being increasingly integrated into developer workflows. While prior work has evaluated agent capabilities for code completion and task automation, there is little work investigating how these agents perform Java refactoring in practice, the types of changes they make, and their impact on code quality. In this study, we present the first analysis of agentic refactoring pull requests in Java, comparing them to developer refactorings across 86 projects per group. Using RefactoringMiner and DesigniteJava 3.0, we identify refactoring types and detect code smells before and after refactoring commits. Our results show that agent refactorings are dominated by annotation changes (the 5 most common refactoring types done by agents are annotation related), in contrast to the diverse structural improvements typical of developers. Despite these differences in refactoring types, we find Cursor to be the only model to show a statistically significant increase in refactoring smells.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates AI agent contributions to documentation-related tasks in software engineering, revealing substantial AI-driven efforts but concerns over document quality and review practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the contributions of AI agents to software documentation tasks, which have been underexplored compared to other aspects of software development.

Method: The authors analyzed 1,997 documentation-related pull requests (PRs) using the AIDev framework to differentiate between those authored by AI agents and human developers.

Result: AI agents contributed substantially more documentation-related PRs than human developers, with limited human review observed on AI-authored content.

Conclusion: AI agents play a significant role in documentation workflows, but concerns arise regarding documentation quality and the collaboration between humans and AI in SE3.0.

Abstract: As software engineering moves toward SE3.0, AI agents are increasingly used to carry out development tasks and contribute changes to software projects. It is therefore important to understand the extent of these contributions and how human developers review and intervene, since these factors shape the risks of delegating work to AI agents. While recent studies have examined how AI agents support software development tasks (e.g., code generation, issue resolution, and PR automation), their role in documentation tasks remains underexplored-even though documentation is widely consumed and shapes how developers understand and use software.
  Using the AIDev, we analyze 1,997 documentation-related pull requests (PRs) authored by AI agents and human developers, where documentation PRs are those that create or modify project documentation artifacts. We find that AI agents submit substantially more documentation-related PRs than humans in the studied repositories. We further observe that agent-authored documentation edits are typically integrated with little follow-up modification from humans, raising concerns about review practices and the reliability of agent-generated documentation. Overall, while AI agents already contribute substantially to documentation workflows, our results suggest concerns for emerging challenges for documentation quality assurance and human-AI collaboration in SE3.0.

Motivation: The authors aim to improve the alignment of LLM-generated code completions with user intent and reduce unnecessary computational requests in JetBrains IDEs.

Method: The study employs boosting- and transformer-based architectures, evaluating their performance on an offline dataset with 98 users and across diverse programming languages, followed by an A/B production study.

Result: The introduced boosting-based models showed improved completion efficiency and quality metrics, validated both in offline evaluations and a production environment.

Conclusion: Auxiliary models show promise for enhancing LLM-powered IDE features, and this work identifies future research directions and challenges.

Abstract: We introduce control models for LLM-powered code completion in JetBrains IDEs: ML classifiers which trigger inference and filter the generated suggestions to better align them with users and reduce unnecessary requests. To this end, we evaluate boosting- and transformer-based architectures on an offline dataset of real code completions with n=98 users. We further evaluate the offline classification performance of our boosting-based approach on a range of syntactically diverse languages; and perform an A/B study in a production environment where they improve completion efficiency and quality metrics. With this study, we hope to demonstrate the potential in using auxiliary models for smarter in-IDE integration of LLM-driven features, highlight fruitful future directions, and open problems.

*Anthony Peruma,Truman Choy,Gerald Lee,Italo De Oliveira Santos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores npm developers' perspectives on security, emphasizing vulnerabilities, preferred tools, and barriers to stronger security practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how npm package developers handle security, their perception of risks, and methods to improve ecosystem safety.

Method: An online survey with 75 npm developers using a mixed-methods analysis approach.

Result: Developers are moderately confident in their package security. Key issues include dependency vulnerabilities, time constraints, alert fatigue from tools, and abandonment of dependencies. Automated methods like npm audit are preferred, but better tools and educational resources are needed.

Conclusion: The research encourages discussions on security best practices and provides insights for improving npm's safety and developer trust.

Abstract: Background: The Node Package Manager (npm) ecosystem plays a vital role in modern software development by providing a vast repository of packages and tools that developers can use to implement their software systems. However, recent vulnerabilities in third-party packages have led to serious security breaches, compromising the integrity of applications that depend on them. Objective: This study investigates how npm package developers perceive and handle security in their work. We examined developers' understanding of security risks, the practices and tools they use, the barriers to stronger security measures, and their suggestions for improving the npm ecosystem's security. Method: We conducted an online survey with 75 npm package developers and undertook a mixed-methods approach to analyzing their responses. Results: While developers prioritize security, they perceive their packages as only moderately secure, with concerns about supply chain attacks, dependency vulnerabilities, and malicious code. Only 40% are satisfied with the current npm security tools due to issues such as alert fatigue. Automated methods such as two-factor authentication and npm audit are favored over code reviews. Many drop dependencies due to abandonment or vulnerabilities, and typically respond to vulnerabilities in their packages by quickly releasing patches. Key barriers include time constraints and high false-positive rates. To improve npm security, developers seek better detection tools, clearer documentation, stronger account protections, and more education initiatives. Conclusion: Our findings will benefit npm package contributors and maintainers by highlighting prevalent security challenges and promoting discussions on best practices to strengthen security and trustworthiness within the npm landscape.

*Giovanna Broccia,Maurice H. ter Beek,Walter Cazzola,Luca Favalli,Francesco Bertolotti,Alessio Ferrari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study evaluates the comprehensibility and user acceptance of the language workbench Neverlang through experiments, highlighting its strengths and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate user-centered aspects (especially comprehensibility and acceptance) of language workbenches, which are often neglected in current literature, to enhance their adoption by language designers.

Method: Used a tailored Method Evaluation Model (MEM) to assess Neverlang's meta-language comprehensibility, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. Experiments were conducted in three iterations with academic participants.

Result: Findings show sufficient comprehension of Neverlang's meta-language, positive perception of its usefulness, and intention to use it. However, ease of use posed difficulties, and user acceptance was affected by perceived ease of use and usefulness. Surprisingly, no strong correlation was found between comprehensibility and user acceptance.

Conclusion: Higher comprehensibility does not directly lead to greater adoption, suggesting a complex relationship between understanding and acceptance of such tools. Addressing ease of use is crucial for improving user acceptance of Neverlang.

Abstract: Language workbenches are tools that enable the definition, reuse, and composition of programming languages and their ecosystems, aiming to streamline language development. To facilitate their adoption by language designers, the comprehensibility of the language used to define other languages is an important aspect to evaluate. Moreover, considering that language workbenches are relatively new tools, user acceptance emerges as a crucial factor to be accounted for during their assessment. Current literature often neglects user-centred aspects like comprehensibility and acceptance in the assessment of this breed of tools. This paper addresses this gap through a family of experiments assessing Neverlang, a modular language workbench. The study adopts a tailored version of the Method Evaluation Model (MEM) to evaluate the comprehensibility of Neverlang's meta-language and programs, as well as user acceptance in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. It also investigates the relationships among these dimensions. The experiments were conducted in three iterations involving participants from academia. The results reveal that users demonstrate sufficient comprehension of Neverlang's meta-language, particularly concerning its syntax, express a favourable perception of its usefulness, and indicate their intention to use it. However, the results also indicate that Neverlang's ease of use remains a challenge. Additionally, variations in the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, whether low or high, influence the users' intention to use the tool. Surprisingly, no significant correlation is found between comprehensibility and user acceptance. Notably, higher comprehensibility of the meta-language does not necessarily translate into greater acceptance, underscoring the complex interplay between comprehension and adoption.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines AGENTS.md files' influence on runtime and token consumption of AI coding agents in GitHub pull requests, finding improved efficiency and comparable task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of repository-level configuration files like AGENTS.md on the efficiency and behavior of AI coding agents in software development environments.

Method: Analyzed 10 repositories and 124 GitHub pull requests, comparing agent performance under conditions with and without AGENTS.md files. Metrics included runtime and token usage.

Result: Presence of AGENTS.md files led to lower median runtime (~28.64%) and reduced token consumption (~16.58%). Task completion remained comparable.

Conclusion: AGENTS.md files enhance operational efficiency of AI coding agents, supporting their integration in software workflows and suggesting potential for broader investigations into repository-level configurations.

Abstract: AI coding agents such as Codex and Claude Code are increasingly used to autonomously contribute to software repositories. However, little is known about how repository-level configuration artifacts affect operational efficiency of the agents. In this paper, we study the impact of AGENTS$.$md files on the runtime and token consumption of AI coding agents operating on GitHub pull requests. We analyze 10 repositories and 124 pull requests, executing agents under two conditions: with and without an AGENTS$.$md file. We measure wall-clock execution time and token usage during agent execution. Our results show that the presence of AGENTS$.$md is associated with a lower median runtime ($Δ28.64$%) and reduced output token consumption ($Δ16.58$%), while maintaining a comparable task completion behavior. Based on these results, we discuss immediate implications for the configuration and deployment of AI coding agents in practice, and outline a broader research agenda on the role of repository-level instructions in shaping the behavior, efficiency, and integration of AI coding agents in software development workflows.

TL;DR: The study explores Android developers' challenges with the Google Play Store Data Safety Section (DSS) form, finding that they face difficulties in data classification, comprehension, and fear of non-compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the developers’ experiences and challenges in accurately reporting app data collection through the Google Play Store’s Data Safety Section (DSS).

Method: The study used an empirical approach, including a survey of 41 Android developers and an analysis of 172 online discussions involving insights from 642 more developers.

Result: Developers often classify data manually, lack confidence in adhering to DSS requirements, heavily rely on online resources, and encounter challenges due to unclear guidelines and fear of app rejection.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for improved guidance and accessible tools to assist developers in fulfilling privacy-aware reporting requirements effectively.

Abstract: Current legal frameworks enforce that Android developers accurately report the data their apps collect. However, large codebases can make this reporting challenging. This paper employs an empirical approach to understand developers' experience with Google Play Store's Data Safety Section (DSS) form.
  We first survey 41 Android developers to understand how they categorize privacy-related data into DSS categories and how confident they feel when completing the DSS form. To gain a broader and more detailed view of the challenges developers encounter during the process, we complement the survey with an analysis of 172 online developer discussions, capturing the perspectives of 642 additional developers. Together, these two data sources represent insights from 683 developers.
  Our findings reveal that developers often manually classify the privacy-related data their apps collect into the data categories defined by Google-or, in some cases, omit classification entirely-and rely heavily on existing online resources when completing the form. Moreover, developers are generally confident in recognizing the data their apps collect, yet they lack confidence in translating this knowledge into DSS-compliant disclosures. Key challenges include issues in identifying privacy-relevant data to complete the form, limited understanding of the form, and concerns about app rejection due to discrepancies with Google's privacy requirements.
  These results underscore the need for clearer guidance and more accessible tooling to support developers in meeting privacy-aware reporting obligations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on computational efficiency, specifically latency and energy consumption, in the security context of RAG-based code generation systems.

Method: Uses an adversarial, mutation-based approach for poisoning contexts retrieved during code generation to produce significantly longer outputs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate DrainCode increases latency by up to 85%, energy consumption by 49%, and output length by over 3x compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: DrainCode highlights vulnerabilities in LLMs' computational efficiency, proving its utility in testing security in resource-constrained scenarios and enabling improved evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. However, the computational costs associated with LLM inference, particularly in terms of latency and energy consumption, have received limited attention in the security context. This paper introduces DrainCode, the first adversarial attack targeting the computational efficiency of RAG-based code generation systems. By strategically poisoning retrieval contexts through a mutation-based approach, DrainCode forces LLMs to produce significantly longer outputs, thereby increasing GPU latency and energy consumption. We evaluate the effectiveness of DrainCode across multiple models. Our experiments show that DrainCode achieves up to an 85% increase in latency, a 49% increase in energy consumption, and more than a 3x increase in output length compared to the baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of the attack across different prompting strategies and its effectiveness compared to different defenses. The results highlight DrainCode as a potential method for increasing the computational overhead of LLMs, making it useful for evaluating LLM security in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lila, a decentralized system for assessing software build reproducibility, addressing challenges in monitoring reproducibility at scale in functional package management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern software faces increased security risks in build systems and distribution. Reproducible builds enhance transparency and trust by ensuring binaries match source code, but adoption is hindered by scalability issues and challenges in reproducibility monitoring.

Method: The authors develop Lila, a decentralized system for reproducibility monitoring. It incorporates distributed build reporting and centralized aggregation, facilitating large-scale reproducibility assessments in functional package management systems.

Result: Lila provides a systematic way to assess and monitor reproducibility in software builds, creating a database for practitioners and aiding empirical reproducibility studies.

Conclusion: The proposed system, Lila, advances reproducibility monitoring, laying a foundation for scalable and transparent reproducible build practices.

Abstract: Ensuring the integrity of software build artifacts is an increasingly important concern for modern software engineering, driven by increasingly sophisticated attacks on build systems, distribution channels, and development infrastructures. Reproducible builds $\unicode{x2013}$ where binaries built independently from the same source code can be verified to be bit-for-bit identical to the distributed artifacts $\unicode{x2013}$ provide a principled foundation for transparency and trust in software distribution.
  Despite their potential, the large-scale adoption of reproducible builds faces two significant challenges: achieving high reproducibility rates across vast software collections and establishing reproducibility monitoring infrastructure that can operate at very large scale. While recent studies have shown that high reproducibility rates are achievable at scale $\unicode{x2013}$ demonstrated by the Nix ecosystem achieving over 90% reproducibility on more than 80,000 packages $\unicode{x2013}$ the problem of effective reproducibility monitoring remains largely unsolved.
  In this work, we address the reproducibility monitoring challenge by introducing Lila, a decentralized system for reproducibility assessment tailored to the functional package management model. Lila enables distributed reporting of build results and aggregation into a reproducibility database, benefiting both practitioners and future empirical build reproducibility studies.

*Bohua Zou,Debayan Roy,Dhimankumar Yogesh Airao,Weihao Xu,Binqi Sun,Yutao Liu,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a non-intrusive profiling framework for analyzing the real-time behavior of large language model (LLM) inference engines, focusing on llama.cpp while extending to similar architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of visibility and profiling precision in LLM inference engines, helping developers understand resource consumption (e.g., memory-bound vs compute-bound) and optimize performance.

Method: The method involves using extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to attach dynamic probes across runtime layers without modifying or recompiling the source, enabling high-fidelity profiling and visualizations.

Result: The framework achieves less than 4% runtime overhead while providing detailed visualizations of runtime operations, uncovering behaviors such as dense inference, Mixture-of-Experts routing, and operator offloading.

Conclusion: This profiling tool significantly improves LLM inference transparency and diagnostics, paving the way for optimization, resource allocation, and deployment strategies.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) move from research to production, understanding how inference engines behave in real time has become both essential and elusive. Unlike general-purpose engines such as ONNX Runtime, today's LLM inference systems offer little operator-level visibility, leaving developers blind to where time and resources go. Even basic questions -- is this workload memory-bound or compute-bound? -- often remain unanswered. To close this gap, we develop a fine-grained, non-intrusive profiling framework for modern LLM inference engines, exemplified by llama.cpp but applicable to similar runtime architectures. Built on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology, our system dynamically attaches probes to runtime functions across multiple layers -- without modifying or recompiling the source. It transforms collected traces into rich visualizations of operators, graphs, timelines, and hardware counter trends, exposing how dense inference, Mixture-of-Experts routing, and operator offloading behave in practice. With less than 4% runtime overhead and high profiling fidelity, our framework makes LLM inference both transparent and diagnosable, turning performance profiling into a practical tool for optimization, scheduling, and resource-aware deployment.

Motivation: Current Large Language Models struggle with complex code generation tasks due to inadequate retrieval and hallucinations.

Result: PKG demonstrates up to 20% pass@1 accuracy improvement on HumanEval and a 34% improvement on MBPP over baselines.

Conclusion: The PKG method improves retrieval precision and mitigates hallucinations in LLMs, effectively handling complex problems while retaining correctness in simple cases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation but struggle with complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by integrating external knowledge, yet retrieval models often miss relevant context, and generation models hallucinate with irrelevant data. We propose Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) for semantic representation and fine-grained retrieval of code and text. Our approach enhances retrieval precision through tree pruning and mitigates hallucinations via a re-ranking mechanism that integrates non-RAG solutions. Structuring external data into finer-grained nodes improves retrieval granularity. Evaluations on HumanEval and MBPP show up to 20% pass@1 accuracy gains and a 34% improvement over baselines on MBPP. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed PKG approach along with re-ranker effectively address complex problems while maintaining minimal negative impact on solutions that are already correct without RAG.

*Jiahe Li,Junru Chen,Fanqi Shen,Jialan Yang,Jada Li,Zhizhang Yuan,Baowen Cheng,Meng Li,Yang Yang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces Semantic Intent Decoding (SID) and BrainMosaic, a system for translating brain activity into natural language while improving semantic richness and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BCIs are limited due to oversimplified semantic frameworks and lack of interpretability, hindering effective communication.

Method: The proposed method leverages Semantic Intent Decoding and BrainMosaic architecture to decode EEG/SEEG brain signals into natural language via compositional semantic units.

Result: Experiments on multilingual EEG and SEEG data show that SID and BrainMosaic outperform previous BCI frameworks, offering better interpretability and expressiveness.

Conclusion: SID and BrainMosaic represent a significant step forward in enhancing natural communication using BCIs.

Abstract: Enabling natural communication through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains one of the most profound challenges in neuroscience and neurotechnology. While existing frameworks offer partial solutions, they are constrained by oversimplified semantic representations and a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semantic Intent Decoding (SID), a novel framework that translates neural activity into natural language by modeling meaning as a flexible set of compositional semantic units. SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm. Extensive experiments on multilingual EEG and clinical SEEG datasets demonstrate that SID and BrainMosaic offer substantial advantages over existing frameworks, paving the way for natural and effective BCI-mediated communication.

### [350] [Deep Neural Networks as Iterated Function Systems and a Generalization Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19958)
*Jonathan Vacher*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper establishes a mathematical connection between deep neural networks (DNNs) and stochastic iterated function systems (IFS), enabling new insights into stability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address fragmented mathematical analysis of DNNs, specifically concerning stability and generalization, and the challenging nature of training and modeling beyond observed data.

Method: The authors leverage stochastic IFS theory, establish invariant properties under contractivity assumptions, and derive a Wasserstein generalization bound for generative modeling. They propose a novel training objective based on minimizing collage-type approximation error.

Result: They illustrate the theoretical findings on a controlled example, successfully test the proposed method on standard image datasets (MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10), and demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This work provides rigor in connecting DNN architectures to stochastic IFS, improving both training stability and generalization in generative modeling, and offers theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, yet their mathematical analysis remains fragmented: stability and generalization are typically studied in disparate frameworks and on a case-by-case basis. Architecturally, DNNs rely on the recursive application of parametrized functions, a mechanism that can be unstable and difficult to train, making stability a primary concern. Even when training succeeds, there are few rigorous results on how well such models generalize beyond the observed data, especially in the generative setting. In this work, we leverage the theory of stochastic Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and show that two important deep architectures can be viewed as, or canonically associated with, place-dependent IFS. This connection allows us to import results from random dynamical systems to (i) establish the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures under suitable contractivity assumptions, and (ii) derive a Wasserstein generalization bound for generative modeling. The bound naturally leads to a new training objective that directly controls the collage-type approximation error between the data distribution and its image under the learned transfer operator. We illustrate the theory on a controlled 2D example and empirically evaluate the proposed objective on standard image datasets (MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10).

### [351] [Minimax Rates for Hyperbolic Hierarchical Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20047)
*Divit Rawal,Sriram Vishwanath*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates an exponential difference in sample complexity for learning hierarchical data between Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, showing hyperbolic embeddings achieve the optimal sample usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical data in machine learning often suffers from inefficiency due to geometric constraints in Euclidean spaces, prompting exploration of alternative hyperbolic geometries.

Method: The authors analyze geometric obstructions in Euclidean spaces and compare them with hyperbolic embeddings, calculating Lipschitz constants and sample complexities. They also apply Fano's inequality for theoretical bounds.

Result: Hyperbolic spaces can achieve constant-distortion embeddings with $O(1)$-Lipschitz realizability and sample complexity on the order of $O(mR \log m)$. Euclidean spaces need exponential Lipschitz constants, resulting in exponential sample complexities.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic representations are superior for hierarchical learning tasks as they align with the information-theoretic optimum and overcome limitations seen in Euclidean embeddings.

Abstract: We prove an exponential separation in sample complexity between Euclidean and hyperbolic representations for learning on hierarchical data under standard Lipschitz regularization. For depth-$R$ hierarchies with branching factor $m$, we first establish a geometric obstruction for Euclidean space: any bounded-radius embedding forces volumetric collapse, mapping exponentially many tree-distant points to nearby locations. This necessitates Lipschitz constants scaling as $\exp(Ω(R))$ to realize even simple hierarchical targets, yielding exponential sample complexity under capacity control. We then show this obstruction vanishes in hyperbolic space: constant-distortion hyperbolic embeddings admit $O(1)$-Lipschitz realizability, enabling learning with $n = O(mR \log m)$ samples. A matching $Ω(mR \log m)$ lower bound via Fano's inequality establishes that hyperbolic representations achieve the information-theoretic optimum. We also show a geometry-independent bottleneck: any rank-$k$ prediction space captures only $O(k)$ canonical hierarchical contrasts.

*Skyler Wu,Yash Nair,Emmanuel J. Candés*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAQ, a method to benchmark large language models efficiently by leveraging historical data, adaptive query selection, and maintaining frequentist coverage, achieving significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking large language models is both computationally intensive and costly. The paper seeks methods to improve efficiency while maintaining reliable evaluation results.

Method: The authors propose Factorized Active Querying (FAQ), which uses a Bayesian factor model, adaptive question selection through a variance-reduction/active-learning policy, and Proactive Active Inference to ensure valid coverage while reducing sample size.

Result: FAQ achieves up to 5 times effective sample size improvement over strong baselines, allowing it to match the CI width of uniform sampling while using significantly fewer queries. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using two benchmark suites under various conditions.

Conclusion: FAQ offers a highly efficient and robust approach to benchmarking large language models, enabling cost-effective and reproducible evaluations with fewer queries.

Abstract: Exhaustively evaluating many large language models (LLMs) on a large suite of benchmarks is expensive. We cast benchmarking as finite-population inference and, under a fixed query budget, seek tight confidence intervals (CIs) for model accuracy with valid frequentist coverage. We propose Factorized Active Querying (FAQ), which (a) leverages historical information through a Bayesian factor model; (b) adaptively selects questions using a hybrid variance-reduction/active-learning sampling policy; and (c) maintains validity through Proactive Active Inference -- a finite-population extension of active inference (Zrnic & Candes, 2024) that enables direct question selection while preserving coverage. With negligible overhead cost, FAQ delivers up to $5\times$ effective sample size gains over strong baselines on two benchmark suites, across varying historical-data missingness levels: this means that it matches the CI width of uniform sampling while using up to $5\times$ fewer queries. We release our source code and our curated datasets to support reproducible evaluation and future research.

### [353] [Empirical Likelihood-Based Fairness Auditing: Distribution-Free Certification and Flagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20269)
*Jie Tang,Chuanlong Xie,Xianli Zeng,Lixing Zhu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces an empirical likelihood-based framework for fairness auditing in machine learning to address algorithmic bias without restrictive assumptions or excessive computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle performance disparities in high-stakes machine learning applications, where sensitive subpopulations experience systematic biases.

Method: The authors employ a non-parametric empirical likelihood-based framework for statistical performance disparity measures, which relies on asymptotic chi-square distributions for valid inference.

Result: The proposed framework achieves more accurate coverage rates and significantly reduces computational latency compared to bootstrap methods. It effectively identifies biases in the COMPAS dataset, pinpointing specific subpopulation impacts.

Conclusion: The empirical likelihood-based approach provides a robust and efficient method for fairness auditing, enhancing bias discovery and reducing computational challenges in large-scale applications.

Abstract: Machine learning models in high-stakes applications, such as recidivism prediction and automated personnel selection, often exhibit systematic performance disparities across sensitive subpopulations, raising critical concerns regarding algorithmic bias. Fairness auditing addresses these risks through two primary functions: certification, which verifies adherence to fairness constraints; and flagging, which isolates specific demographic groups experiencing disparate treatment. However, existing auditing techniques are frequently limited by restrictive distributional assumptions or prohibitive computational overhead. We propose a novel empirical likelihood-based (EL) framework that constructs robust statistical measures for model performance disparities. Unlike traditional methods, our approach is non-parametric; the proposed disparity statistics follow asymptotically chi-square or mixed chi-square distributions, ensuring valid inference without assuming underlying data distributions. This framework uses a constrained optimization profile that admits stable numerical solutions, facilitating both large-scale certification and efficient subpopulation discovery. Empirically, the EL methods outperform bootstrap-based approaches, yielding coverage rates closer to nominal levels while reducing computational latency by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the practical utility of this framework on the COMPAS dataset, where it successfully flags intersectional biases, specifically identifying a significantly higher positive prediction rate for African-American males under 25 and a systemic under-prediction for Caucasian females relative to the population mean.

TL;DR: This study introduces a reconstruction method to generate dense fields from sparse measurements using an automatically differentiable numerical simulator during training, without relying on spatial statistics or pre-existing dense field data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating dense fields from sparse measurements in scenarios where spatial statistics or dense field examples are unavailable.

Method: Incorporating an automatically differentiable numerical simulator into the training phase to enable the generation of dense fields without relying on spatial statistics or example data.

Result: The proposed method outperforms statistical and neural network-based approaches on three benchmark fluid mechanics problems.

Conclusion: The introduced approach is a significant improvement in generating dense field data from sparse measurements without prior statistical or example data, paving the way for more accurate and accessible solutions in related applications.

Abstract: Generating dense physical fields from sparse measurements is a fundamental question in sampling, signal processing, and many other applications. State-of-the-art methods either use spatial statistics or rely on examples of dense fields in the training phase, which often are not available, and thus rely on synthetic data. Here, we present a reconstruction method that generates dense fields from sparse measurements, without assuming availability of the spatial statistics, nor of examples of the dense fields. This is made possible through the introduction of an automatically differentiable numerical simulator into the training phase of the method. The method is shown to have superior results over statistical and neural network based methods on a set of three standard problems from fluid mechanics.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of survival analysis in credit risk modeling under non-stationary data environments and proposes a robust dynamic joint modeling framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of data drift, caused by changing borrower behavior, macroeconomic conditions, and policy shifts, which affects the performance of traditional survival-based credit risk models.

Method: A novel model combines longitudinal behavioral markers, discrete-time hazard formulation, landmark one-hot encoding, and isotonic calibration. Simulated data drifts are tested to evaluate model robustness.

Result: The proposed model outperforms traditional survival models, tree-based drift-adaptive learners, and gradient boosting methods across various data drift scenarios in terms of discrimination and calibration.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the landmark-based joint model is superior for handling non-stationary environments and improves credit risk evaluation under different data drift scenarios.

Abstract: Survival analysis has become a standard approach for modelling time to default by time-varying covariates in credit risk. Unlike most existing methods that implicitly assume a stationary data-generating process, in practise, mortgage portfolios are exposed to various forms of data drift caused by changing borrower behaviour, macroeconomic conditions, policy regimes and so on. This study investigates the impact of data drift on survival-based credit risk models and proposes a dynamic joint modelling framework to improve robustness under non-stationary environments. The proposed model integrates a longitudinal behavioural marker derived from balance dynamics with a discrete-time hazard formulation, combined with landmark one-hot encoding and isotonic calibration. Three types of data drift (sudden, incremental and recurring) are simulated and analysed on mortgage loan datasets from Freddie Mac. Experiments and corresponding evidence show that the proposed landmark-based joint model consistently outperforms classical survival models, tree-based drift-adaptive learners and gradient boosting methods in terms of discrimination and calibration across all drift scenarios, which confirms the superiority of our model design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-theoretic clustering method that addresses clustering challenges in sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods struggle when the cluster structure is present only in subsets of the feature space, especially in sparse data settings.

Method: The authors propose an information-theoretic framework that enables joint feature weighting and clustering to effectively deal with sparsity issues.

Result: Simulations on synthetic data and an application to real-world genomics data demonstrate the method's effectiveness and competitiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a viable and competitive alternative to traditional clustering techniques, particularly in handling sparse data scenarios.

Abstract: Cluster analysis relates to the task of assigning objects into groups which ideally present some desirable characteristics. When a cluster structure is confined to a subset of the feature space, traditional clustering techniques face unprecedented challenges. We present an information-theoretic framework that overcomes the problems associated with sparse data, allowing for joint feature weighting and clustering. Our proposal constitutes a competitive alternative to existing clustering algorithms for sparse data, as demonstrated through simulations on synthetic data. The effectiveness of our method is established by an application on a real-world genomics data set.

*Yilin Song,Dan M. Kluger,Harsh Parikh,Tian Gu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) uses predictions and a small labeled dataset to improve statistical efficiency while guarding against bias. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to applying PPI responsibly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of machine learning predictions in various fields, there's a need for frameworks that incorporate them responsibly into analysis without introducing bias or wasting information.

Method: The paper synthesizes theoretical foundations, methodological variants, connections to literature, and diagnostic tools into a unified workflow for understanding and applying PPI.

Result: PPI variants improve confidence intervals, but misuse (e.g., double-dipping) leads to anti-conservative results. Assumptions like missing-not-at-random pose biases in all methods.

Conclusion: By framing PPI as a flexible recipe and providing diagnostic tools and decision strategies, the work enables researchers to better integrate predictions into valid statistical inference.

Abstract: Machine learning predictions are increasingly used to supplement incomplete or costly-to-measure outcomes in fields such as biomedical research, environmental science, and social science. However, treating predictions as ground truth introduces bias while ignoring them wastes valuable information. Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) offers a principled framework that leverages predictions from large unlabeled datasets to improve statistical efficiency while maintaining valid inference through explicit bias correction using a smaller labeled subset. Despite its potential, the growing PPI variants and the subtle distinctions between them have made it challenging for practitioners to determine when and how to apply these methods responsibly. This paper demystifies PPI by synthesizing its theoretical foundations, methodological extensions, connections to existing statistics literature, and diagnostic tools into a unified practical workflow. Using the Mosaiks housing price data, we show that PPI variants produce tighter confidence intervals than complete-case analysis, but that double-dipping, i.e. reusing training data for inference, leads to anti-conservative confidence intervals and coverages. Under missing-not-at-random mechanisms, all methods, including classical inference using only labeled data, yield biased estimates. We provide a decision flowchart linking assumption violations to appropriate PPI variants, a summary table of selective methods, and practical diagnostic strategies for evaluating core assumptions. By framing PPI as a general recipe rather than a single estimator, this work bridges methodological innovation and applied practice, helping researchers responsibly integrate predictions into valid inference.

*Waldyn G. Martinez*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: VSCOUT is a proposed distribution-free framework for handling retrospective monitoring in complex, high-dimensional datasets, overcoming challenges like contamination and non-Gaussian structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern processes generate complex, high-dimensional data that often do not fit classical SPC assumptions, requiring robust methods to detect anomalies and establish reliable baselines.

Method: VSCOUT integrates an ARD-VAE architecture with an ensemble-based approach for latent space outlier filtering and changepoint detection, followed by a retraining phase for refining the in-control baseline.

Result: VSCOUT demonstrates superior anomaly detection sensitivity and controlled false alarm rates in experiments, outperforming traditional and modern alternatives, while being scalable and robust.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical, flexible, and effective solution for retrospective monitoring and anomaly detection, suitable for AI-enabled environments with challenging data.

Abstract: Modern industrial and service processes generate high-dimensional, non-Gaussian, and contamination-prone data that challenge the foundational assumptions of classical Statistical Process Control (SPC). Heavy tails, multimodality, nonlinear dependencies, and sparse special-cause observations can distort baseline estimation, mask true anomalies, and prevent reliable identification of an in-control (IC) reference set. To address these challenges, we introduce VSCOUT, a distribution-free framework designed specifically for retrospective (Phase I) monitoring in high-dimensional settings. VSCOUT combines an Automatic Relevance Determination Variational Autoencoder (ARD-VAE) architecture with ensemble-based latent outlier filtering and changepoint detection. The ARD prior isolates the most informative latent dimensions, while the ensemble and changepoint filters identify pointwise and structural contamination within the determined latent space. A second-stage retraining step removes flagged observations and re-estimates the latent structure using only the retained inliers, mitigating masking and stabilizing the IC latent manifold. This two-stage refinement produces a clean and reliable IC baseline suitable for subsequent Phase II deployment. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that VSCOUT achieves superior sensitivity to special-cause structure while maintaining controlled false alarms, outperforming classical SPC procedures, robust estimators, and modern machine-learning baselines. Its scalability, distributional flexibility, and resilience to complex contamination patterns position VSCOUT as a practical and effective method for retrospective modeling and anomaly detection in AI-enabled environments.

*Zhirui Li,Keith D. Levin,Zhiang Zhao,Vince Lyzinski*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores graph matching in a sequence of graphs corrupted by time-dependent Markov chain noise, deriving and comparing anonymization thresholds using novel edge-dependent noise models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how graph matching is impacted by sequence generation under edge-dependent noise and compare it to classical thresholds. The work aims to uncover differences between mixing properties and anonymity thresholds using theoretical and real-world datasets.

Method: The paper employs a novel Markov chain-based noise model called edgelighter to simulate edge-dependent noise on graphs (Erdős-Rényi and Stochastic Block Model). Analytical thresholds for anonymization and mixing are derived mathematically and verified using simulations and empirical studies using Facebook and email network graphs.

Result: The graph matching anonymization thresholds are found equivalent to the mixing time for Erdős-Rényi graphs. For structured graphs like Stochastic Block Models, anonymization occurs faster than the global mixing time. Simulations validate theoretical findings, linking theoretical and practical behavior under noise.

Conclusion: Graph matching under edge-dependent noise introduces unique anonymization behavior, demonstrating faster anonymity in structured graphs. Results highlight the relationship between graph structure, noise, and matching thresholds, offering insights for both theoretical and applied graph analysis.

Abstract: We consider the problem of graph matching for a sequence of graphs generated under a time-dependent Markov chain noise model. Our edgelighter error model, a variant of the classical lamplighter random walk, iteratively corrupts the graph $G_0$ with edge-dependent noise, creating a sequence of noisy graph copies $(G_t)$. Much of the graph matching literature is focused on anonymization thresholds in edge-independent noise settings, and we establish novel anonymization thresholds in this edge-dependent noise setting when matching $G_0$ and $G_t$. Moreover, we also compare this anonymization threshold with the mixing properties of the Markov chain noise model. We show that when $G_0$ is drawn from an Erdős-Rényi model, the graph matching anonymization threshold and the mixing time of the edgelighter walk are both of order $Θ(n^2\log n)$. We further demonstrate that for more structured model for $G_0$ (e.g., the Stochastic Block Model), graph matching anonymization can occur in $O(n^α\log n)$ time for some $α<2$, indicating that anonymization can occur before the Markov chain noise model globally mixes. Through extensive simulations, we verify our theoretical bounds in the settings of Erdős-Rényi random graphs and stochastic block model random graphs, and explore our findings on real-world datasets derived from a Facebook friendship network and a European research institution email communication network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance understanding of tail bounds and concentration inequalities for structured weighted sums of exchangeable random variables, surpassing classical frameworks of independent terms.

Method: The authors develop structured-dependent Hoeffding and Bernstein bounds under exchangeability, recover optimal constants for known results, and derive sharper concentration bounds for combinatorial matrix sums.

Result: The study successfully improves concentration bounds and validates theoretical predictions for multi-factor response models and fixed-design sketching methods through numerical evidence.

Conclusion: The work advances the toolset for analyzing structured sums in statistical models, offering sharper bounds and demonstrating their utility in practical applications.

Abstract: We study concentration inequalities for structured weighted sums of random data, including (i) tensor inner products and (ii) sequential matrix sums. We are interested in tail bounds and concentration inequalities for those structured weighted sums under exchangeability, extending beyond the classical framework of independent terms.
  We develop Hoeffding and Bernstein bounds provided with structure-dependent exchangeability. Along the way, we recover known results in weighted sum of exchangeable random variables and i.i.d. sums of random matrices to the optimal constants. Notably, we develop a sharper concentration bound for combinatorial sum of matrix arrays than the results previously derived from Chatterjee's method of exchangeable pairs.
  For applications, the richer structures provide us with novel analytical tools for estimating the average effect of multi-factor response models and studying fixed-design sketching methods in federated averaging. We apply our results to these problems, and find that our theoretical predictions are corroborated by numerical evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in creating a Bayesian framework for regression on the spherical domain, ensuring statistical efficiency and exact mathematical formulations for posterior analysis and contraction rates.

Method: The authors use isotropic Gaussian field priors and the harmonic structure of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The model uses spherical harmonics for diagonalization, yielding Gaussian sequence representation. They derive posterior distributions, optimal truncation schemes, and establish contraction rates for Gaussian priors with polynomially decaying spectra.

Result: Key results include exact posterior distributions in closed form, optimal spectral truncation, contraction rates over Sobolev classes, and minimax-optimal results. It also connects the posterior mean to intrinsic penalized least-squares estimators.

Conclusion: This work provides a rigorous and geometrically intrinsic Bayesian approach to spherical regression, establishing mathematical links between posterior analysis and classical smoothing splines with practical implications for Sobolev settings.

Abstract: We develop a fully intrinsic Bayesian framework for nonparametric regression on the unit sphere based on isotropic Gaussian field priors and the harmonic structure induced by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Under uniform random design, the regression model admits an exact diagonalization in the spherical harmonic basis, yielding a Gaussian sequence representation with frequency-dependent multiplicities.
  Exploiting this structure, we derive closed-form posterior distributions, optimal spectral truncation schemes, and sharp posterior contraction rates under integrated squared loss. For Gaussian priors with polynomially decaying angular power spectra, including spherical Matérn priors, we establish posterior contraction rates over Sobolev classes, which are minimax-optimal under correct prior calibration.
  We further show that the posterior mean admits an exact variational characterization as a geometrically intrinsic penalized least-squares estimator, equivalent to a Laplace-Beltrami smoothing spline.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper models the dynamics of human-AI collective knowledge ecosystems, analyzing growth regimes and providing insights into sustainable development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As humans and large language models (LLMs) increasingly co-create and consume shared knowledge archives, it is crucial to understand the dynamics and outcomes of these interactions, as they can bring benefits or systemic risks.

Method: The study proposes a dynamical model that incorporates archive size and quality, model skill, human skill, and query volume. The model includes interactions like LLM content inflows, human learning pathways, and LLM training modalities. Numerical experiments and real-world case studies (e.g., PubMed, GitHub, and Wikipedia) illustrate the model's applicability.

Result: The analysis identifies distinct growth behaviors, highlights the effects of platform policies (e.g., gate strictness), and shows the impact of LLM additions on human input. It successfully fits the model to pre- and post-ChatGPT knowledge flows on Wikipedia, revealing trends consistent with theoretical regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a foundation for understanding and managing the complex dynamics of human-AI knowledge ecosystems, offering actionable strategies for ensuring sustainable growth and quality.

Abstract: Humans and large language models (LLMs) now co-produce and co-consume the web's shared knowledge archives. Such human-AI collective knowledge ecosystems contain feedback loops with both benefits (e.g., faster growth, easier learning) and systemic risks (e.g., quality dilution, skill reduction, model collapse). To understand such phenomena, we propose a minimal, interpretable dynamical model of the co-evolution of archive size, archive quality, model (LLM) skill, aggregate human skill, and query volume. The model captures two content inflows (human, LLM) controlled by a gate on LLM-content admissions, two learning pathways for humans (archive study vs. LLM assistance), and two LLM-training modalities (corpus-driven scaling vs. learning from human feedback). Through numerical experiments, we identify different growth regimes (e.g., healthy growth, inverted flow, inverted learning, oscillations), and show how platform and policy levers (gate strictness, LLM training, human learning pathways) shift the system across regime boundaries. Two domain configurations (PubMed, GitHub and Copilot) illustrate contrasting steady states under different growth rates and moderation norms. We also fit the model to Wikipedia's knowledge flow during pre-ChatGPT and post-ChatGPT eras separately. We find a rise in LLM additions with a concurrent decline in human inflow, consistent with a regime identified by the model. Our model and analysis yield actionable insights for sustainable growth of human-AI collective knowledge on the Web.

*Nattavudh Powdthavee,Sandra J. Geiger*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) can predict perception gaps in climate action globally and finds that certain LLMs effectively estimate public perceptions, albeit with limitations in less digitally connected regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Widespread misperception of others’ support for climate action hampers systemic changes, necessitating efficient and accurate tools to assess these perception gaps worldwide.

Method: The study compared four state-of-the-art LLMs with Gallup World Poll data and statistical regressions across 125 countries, analyzing their ability to model perception gaps and identifying key psychological processes underlying these predictions.

Result: LLMs, particularly Claude, could accurately predict public perceptions with a mean absolute error (MAE) of ~5 percentage points and a high correlation (r = .77), although performance dropped in lower-GDP, less-connected nations. They relied on structured reasoning rather than memorization.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective tools for analyzing perception gaps in climate action, offering a rapid alternative to traditional surveys in resource-rich countries and supplemental insights in underrepresented regions.

Abstract: Although most people support climate action, widespread underestimation of others' support stalls individual and systemic changes. In this preregistered experiment, we test whether large language models (LLMs) can reliably predict these perception gaps worldwide. Using country-level indicators and public opinion data from 125 countries, we benchmark four state-of-the-art LLMs against Gallup World Poll 2021/22 data and statistical regressions. LLMs, particularly Claude, accurately capture public perceptions of others' willingness to contribute financially to climate action (MAE approximately 5 p.p.; r = .77), comparable to statistical models, though performance declines in less digitally connected, lower-GDP countries. Controlled tests show that LLMs capture the key psychological process - social projection with a systematic downward bias - and rely on structured reasoning rather than memorized values. Overall, LLMs provide a rapid tool for assessing perception gaps in climate action, serving as an alternative to costly surveys in resource-rich countries and as a complement in underrepresented populations.

TL;DR: The study investigates how AI assistance affects skill acquisition in novice workers and finds it can impair learning while not significantly improving efficiency unless tasks are fully delegated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI assistance impacts skill acquisition and mastery of new tools among novices, especially as such assistance becomes common in professional domains.

Method: Randomized experiments were conducted where developers learned a new asynchronous programming library with and without AI assistance. AI interaction patterns were analyzed.

Result: AI use hindered conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging skills. While some productivity gains were seen with full task delegation, they came at the cost of learning.

Conclusion: AI assistance must be integrated cautiously into workflows, particularly in critical domains, to ensure skill development is not compromised.

Abstract: AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.

### [365] [Jurisdiction as Structural Barrier: How Privacy Policy Organization May Reduce Visibility of Substantive Disclosures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20792)
*Thomas Brackin*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper investigates a pattern in privacy policies where precise information about data practices is hidden in region-specific sections, limiting transparency for users outside those areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of inadequate transparency in privacy policies, which undermines users’ understanding of data practices, particularly for those outside regulated jurisdictions.

Method: The study analyzed 123 companies' privacy policies and identified patterns of jurisdiction-specific disclosures. It utilized information foraging theory and manual annotations to validate findings.

Result: 282 instances of the disclosure pattern were found across 77 companies (62.6% of the sample), with 138 instances validated conservatively in 54 companies (44%). Post-2018 categories await further validation.

Conclusion: The authors propose restructuring privacy policies to include universal substantive disclosure, where all relevant practices are in the main policy body. This can enhance transparency and be implemented using existing regulatory standards.

Abstract: Privacy policies are supposed to provide notice. But what if substantive information appears only where users skip it? We identify a structural pattern we call jurisdiction-siloed disclosure: information about data practices appearing in specific, actionable form only within regional compliance sections labeled "California Residents" or "EU/UK Users," while general sections use vague or qualified language for the same practices.
  Our audit of 123 major companies identifies 282 potential instances across 77 companies (62.6% of this purposive sample). A conservative estimate restricted to practice categories validated against OPP-115 human annotations finds 138 instances across 54 companies (44%); post-2018 categories central to our findings await independent validation. If users skip jurisdiction-labeled sections as information foraging theory predicts, users outside regulated jurisdictions would receive less specific information about practices affecting them--a transparency failure operating through document architecture rather than omission.
  We propose universal substantive disclosure: practices affecting all users should appear in the main policy body, with regional sections containing only procedural rights information. This standard finds support in analogous disclosure regimes (securities, truth-in-lending, nutritional labeling) where material information must reach all affected parties. Regulators could operationalize this through the FTC's "clear and conspicuous" standard and GDPR transparency principles.
  This work is hypothesis-generating: we establish that the structural pattern exists and ground the transparency concern in behavioral theory, but direct measurement of jurisdiction-specific section skipping remains the critical validation priority. We release our methodology and annotated dataset to enable replication.

### [366] [Agent Benchmarks Fail Public Sector Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20617)
*Jonathan Rystrøm,Chris Schmitz,Karolina Korgul,Jan Batzner,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the need for benchmarks that meet public-sector-specific needs to evaluate Large Language Model-based agents. It reveals no current benchmarks fulfill these requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure that Large Language Model (LLM) agents deployed in the public sector comply with legal, procedural, and structural demands. The inadequacy of current benchmarks to measure these aspects motivates this research.

Method: The authors define criteria for benchmarks based on public administration literature, ensuring they are process-based, realistic, public-sector-specific, and report appropriate metrics. They analyzed over 1,300 benchmark papers using an expert-validated LLM-assisted pipeline.

Result: Their analysis highlights that no existing benchmark fulfills all established public-sector-specific criteria, identifying a gap in benchmark development.

Conclusion: The paper calls researchers to develop public sector-relevant benchmarks and advises public-sector officials to adopt these criteria in their evaluations of agentic use cases.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Model-based agents (LLM agents) in the public sector requires assuring that they meet the stringent legal, procedural, and structural requirements of public-sector institutions. Practitioners and researchers often turn to benchmarks for such assessments. However, it remains unclear what criteria benchmarks must meet to ensure they adequately reflect public-sector requirements, or how many existing benchmarks do so. In this paper, we first define such criteria based on a first-principles survey of public administration literature: benchmarks must be \emph{process-based}, \emph{realistic}, \emph{public-sector-specific} and report \emph{metrics} that reflect the unique requirements of the public sector. We analyse more than 1,300 benchmark papers for these criteria using an expert-validated LLM-assisted pipeline. Our results show that no single benchmark meets all of the criteria. Our findings provide a call to action for both researchers to develop public sector-relevant benchmarks and for public-sector officials to apply these criteria when evaluating their own agentic use cases.

### [367] [Taxonomy of the Retrieval System Framework: Pitfalls and Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20131)
*Deep Shah,Sanket Badhe,Nehal Kathrotia*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper provides a structured framework for balancing efficiency and effectiveness in embedding retrieval systems, focusing on four key system design layers: Representation, Granularity, Orchestration, and Robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help practitioners navigate the complex trade-offs and improve system design in embedding retrieval systems, ensuring optimal performance for modern neural search.

Method: The paper organizes the design considerations into four layers: analyzing representation, granularity, orchestration strategies, and robustness factors, to form a systematic decision framework.

Result: The structured analysis evaluates design methods like Bi-encoders, hierarchical chunking, multi-stage reranking, and robustness measures, addressing capacity and performance limitations in neural search systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework serves as a guide to optimize embedding retrieval systems by targeting semantic relevance, handling long-context documents, transcending single-vector methods, and improving robustness.

Abstract: Designing an embedding retrieval system requires navigating a complex design space of conflicting trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness. This work structures these decisions as a vertical traversal of the system design stack. We begin with the Representation Layer by examining how loss functions and architectures, specifically Bi-encoders and Cross-encoders, define semantic relevance and geometric projection. Next, we analyze the Granularity Layer and evaluate how segmentation strategies like Atomic and Hierarchical chunking mitigate information bottlenecks in long-context documents. Moving to the Orchestration Layer, we discuss methods that transcend the single-vector paradigm, including hierarchical retrieval, agentic decomposition, and multi-stage reranking pipelines to resolve capacity limitations. Finally, we address the Robustness Layer by identifying architectural mitigations for domain generalization failures, lexical blind spots, and the silent degradation of retrieval quality due to temporal drift. By categorizing these limitations and design choices, we provide a comprehensive framework for practitioners to optimize the efficiency-effectiveness frontier in modern neural search systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLaTTE, a scalable transformer architecture used for ad recommendations which leverages scaling laws similar to LLMs for sequence modeling, and shows significant performance improvements in a real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in scaling recommendation models while adhering to latency constraints, and leverages insights from LLMs to enhance recommendation efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage scalable transformer architecture (LLaTTE) that utilizes semantic features for scaling and offloads heavy computation to an asynchronous upstream user model to balance latency and performance.

Result: Deployment of the proposed framework at Meta demonstrated a 4.3% improvement in conversion rates on platforms like Facebook Feed and Reels, with minimal serving latency.

Conclusion: Semantic features are critical for scaling and efficient utilization of transformer architectures in recommendation systems, and the proposed framework serves as a model for industrial-scale applications of scaling laws.

Abstract: We present LLaTTE (LLM-Style Latent Transformers for Temporal Events), a scalable transformer architecture for production ads recommendation. Through systematic experiments, we demonstrate that sequence modeling in recommendation systems follows predictable power-law scaling similar to LLMs. Crucially, we find that semantic features bend the scaling curve: they are a prerequisite for scaling, enabling the model to effectively utilize the capacity of deeper and longer architectures. To realize the benefits of continued scaling under strict latency constraints, we introduce a two-stage architecture that offloads the heavy computation of large, long-context models to an asynchronous upstream user model. We demonstrate that upstream improvements transfer predictably to downstream ranking tasks. Deployed as the largest user model at Meta, this multi-stage framework drives a 4.3\% conversion uplift on Facebook Feed and Reels with minimal serving overhead, establishing a practical blueprint for harnessing scaling laws in industrial recommender systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MALLOC, a benchmark for memory-aware compression strategies in large-scale recommendation systems and investigates their performance comprehensively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling laws have led to expanding recommendation models, but computational and memory costs pose challenges, especially with long-sequence user interactions.

Method: MALLOC systematically evaluates memory management techniques in state-of-the-art recommenders by integrating and benchmarking them through extensive experiments.

Result: MALLOC demonstrates its reliability in improving recommendation efficiency and complexity through experimental comparisons.

Conclusion: MALLOC provides a reproducible evaluation platform for memory management strategies, advancing large-scale recommendation systems.

Abstract: The scaling law, which indicates that model performance improves with increasing dataset and model capacity, has fueled a growing trend in expanding recommendation models in both industry and academia. However, the advent of large-scale recommenders also brings significantly higher computational costs, particularly under the long-sequence dependencies inherent in the user intent of recommendation systems. Current approaches often rely on pre-storing the intermediate states of the past behavior for each user, thereby reducing the quadratic re-computation cost for the following requests. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often treat memory merely as a medium for acceleration, without adequately considering the space overhead it introduces. This presents a critical challenge in real-world recommendation systems with billions of users, each of whom might initiate thousands of interactions and require massive memory for state storage. Fortunately, there have been several memory management strategies examined for compression in LLM, while most have not been evaluated on the recommendation task. To mitigate this gap, we introduce MALLOC, a comprehensive benchmark for memory-aware long sequence compression. MALLOC presents a comprehensive investigation and systematic classification of memory management techniques applicable to large sequential recommendations. These techniques are integrated into state-of-the-art recommenders, enabling a reproducible and accessible evaluation platform. Through extensive experiments across accuracy, efficiency, and complexity, we demonstrate the holistic reliability of MALLOC in advancing large-scale recommendation.

*Tanmay Karmakar,Sourav Saha,Debapriyo Majumdar,Surjyanee Halder*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper investigates minimal query-aware attacks on Neural Ranking Models (NRMs) that promote a target document's ranking by inserting or substituting a single semantically aligned word.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art Neural Ranking Models and demonstrate practical risks of adversarial perturbations.

Method: Designed query-aware attacks, including white-box heuristic and gradient-guided approaches, to modify documents minimally for ranking promotion.

Result: Single-word attacks achieved up to 91% success with fewer than two token modifications per document on BERT and monoT5 re-rankers.

Conclusion: Demonstrates real-world risks of adversarial attacks on NRMs and suggests the need for more robust defenses against such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Neural ranking models (NRMs) achieve strong retrieval effectiveness, yet prior work has shown they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We revisit this robustness question with a minimal, query-aware attack that promotes a target document by inserting or substituting a single, semantically aligned word - the query center. We study heuristic and gradient-guided variants, including a white-box method that identifies influential insertion points. On TREC-DL 2019/2020 with BERT and monoT5 re-rankers, our single-word attacks achieve up to 91% success while modifying fewer than two tokens per document on average, achieving competitive rank and score boosts with far fewer edits under a comparable white-box setup to ensure fair evaluation against PRADA. We also introduce new diagnostic metrics to analyze attack sensitivity beyond aggregate success rates. Our analysis reveals a Goldilocks zone in which mid-ranked documents are most vulnerable. These findings demonstrate practical risks and motivate future defenses for robust neural ranking.

*Kargi Chauhan,Mahalakshmi Venkateswarlu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that longer customer purchase histories improve recommendation quality using LLMs, finding no significant quality gain beyond short contexts, which could reduce costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to question the widely held belief that using longer user purchase histories results in better personalized recommendations with LLMs.

Method: The study conducts a systematic benchmark of four state-of-the-art LLMs with varying context lengths (5 to 50 items) using the REGEN dataset, involving experiments with 50 users.

Result: The results show that recommendation quality does not significantly improve with increased context length, maintaining flat scores (0.17-0.23). Shorter contexts can reduce costs by 88% without compromising quality.

Conclusion: The study overturns the 'more context is better' paradigm, providing new guidelines for optimizing LLM-based recommendation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for personalized product recommendations, with practitioners commonly assuming that longer user purchase histories lead to better predictions. We challenge this assumption through a systematic benchmark of four state of the art LLMs GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen2.5-72B, and Gemini 2.5 Flash across context lengths ranging from 5 to 50 items using the REGEN dataset.
  Surprisingly, our experiments with 50 users in a within subject design reveal no significant quality improvement with increased context length. Quality scores remain flat across all conditions (0.17--0.23). Our findings have significant practical implications: practitioners can reduce inference costs by approximately 88\% by using context (5--10 items) instead of longer histories (50 items), without sacrificing recommendation quality. We also analyze latency patterns across providers and find model specific behaviors that inform deployment decisions. This work challenges the existing ``more context is better'' paradigm and provides actionable guidelines for cost effective LLM based recommendation systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system for adding sequencing constraints to smart contract function calls by using integer global priorities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance expressivity and tractability of block production while enabling sequencing constraints in modern blockchain applications.

Method: The authors introduce a system using integer global priorities for contract function calls, adhering to constraints that maintain a logical sequence.

Result: The system ensures transactions are sequenced by priority order, adhering to five independent axioms.

Conclusion: This method uniquely satisfies the proposed axioms while enabling blockchain transaction management improvements.

Abstract: Modern blockchain applications benefit from the ability to specify sequencing constraints on the transactions that interact with them. This paper proposes a principled and axiomatically justified way of adding sequencing constraints on smart contract function calls that balances expressivity with the tractability of block production. Specifically, we propose a system in which contract developers are allowed to set an integer global priority for each of their calls, so long as that the call's chosen priority is no higher than the priority of any of its referenced calls. Block builders must then simply sequence transactions in priority order (from high to low priority), breaking ties however they would like. We show that this system is the unique system that satisfies five independent axioms.

### [373] [Delta Fair Sharing: Performance Isolation for Multi-Tenant Storage Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20030)
*Tyler Griggs,Soujanya Ponnapalli,Dev Bali,Wenjie Ma,James DeLoye,Audrey Cheng,Jaewan Hong,Natacha Crooks,Scott Shenker,Ion Stoica,Matei Zaharia*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces Delta Fair Sharing (DFS), which offers new algorithms to ensure performance isolation in cloud storage systems, focusing on reducing tail-latency spikes due to resource delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current storage systems lack efficient performance isolation, as traditional methods like fair sharing fail due to high preemption delays in storage resources, leading to poor client tail-latency.

Method: The authors propose the Delta Fair Sharing family of algorithms that guarantee δ-fairness (delayed fairness within δ time units) and δ-Pareto-efficiency to limit client delays and maximize resource usage.

Result: They implemented Delta Fair Sharing in FAIRDB, a RocksDB extension, demonstrating that this approach provides better performance isolation for well-behaved clients compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Delta Fair Sharing ensures performance isolation by addressing resource-acquisition delays, reducing client tail-latency spikes, and maintaining efficient resource usage.

Abstract: Modern storage systems, often deployed to support multiple tenants in the cloud, must provide performance isolation. Unfortunately, traditional approaches such as fair sharing do not provide performance isolation for storage systems, because their resources (e.g., write buffers and read caches) exhibit high preemption delays. These delays lead to unacceptable spikes in client tail latencies, as clients may be forced to wait arbitrarily long to receive their fair share of resources.
  We introduce Delta Fair Sharing, a family of algorithms for sharing resources with high preemption delays. These algorithms satisfy two key properties: $δ$-fairness, which bounds a client's delay in receiving its fair share of resources to $δ$ time units, and $δ$-Pareto-efficiency, which allocates unused resources to clients with unmet demand. Together, these properties capture resource-acquisition delays end-to-end, bound well-behaved clients' tail-latency spikes to $δ$ time units, and ensure high utilization. We implement such algorithms in FAIRDB, an extension of RocksDB. Our evaluation shows that FAIRDB isolates well-behaved clients from high-demand workloads better than state-of-the-art alternatives.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GG-PI, a framework combining generative modeling and Gibbs sampling to simulate nuclear quantum effects faster and more efficiently than traditional methods like PIMD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current simulations of nuclear quantum effects using methods like PIMD are accurate but computationally expensive. The authors aim to provide a cost-effective alternative to achieve accurate quantum statistics.

Method: GG-PI combines generative modeling of single-bead conditional density with Gibbs sampling. It leverages classical simulation data for training and can be used across different temperatures without retraining.

Result: GG-PI achieves significant reductions in computational time compared to PIMD when tested on standard test systems.

Conclusion: GG-PI demonstrates a scalable and efficient framework for recovering quantum statistics, extending to various problems with similar Markov structures.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of nuclear quantum effects is essential for molecular modeling but expensive using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). We present GG-PI, a ring-polymer-based framework that combines generative modeling of the single-bead conditional density with Gibbs sampling to recover quantum statistics from classical simulation data. GG-PI uses inexpensive standard classical simulations or existing data for training and allows transfer across temperatures without retraining. On standard test systems, GG-PI significantly reduces wall clock time compared to PIMD. Our approach extends easily to a wide range of problems with similar Markov structure.

*Murad Farzulla*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: This study examines if cryptocurrency whitepaper claims align with market behaviors, finding weak alignment through a pipeline combining NLP and tensor decomposition, with detailed statistical and factor analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between cryptocurrency whitepaper narratives and observed market behavior, as whitepapers often articulate the potential and capabilities of projects.

Method: A combination of zero-shot NLP classification (BART-MNLI), CP tensor decomposition, and statistical analysis methodologies were used to test alignment across different data spaces related to claims, statistics, and latent factors.

Result: Weak alignment was observed between whitepaper claims and market behavior across claims-statistics (phi=0.341), claims-factors (phi=0.077), and statistics-factors (phi=0.197). Some assets showed positive alignment, while others diverged significantly.

Conclusion: There is weak alignment between cryptocurrency narratives and market behavior. The results suggest limited insights from narratives for market analysis, though methodology effectively detects existing relationships.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency projects articulate value propositions through whitepapers, making claims about functionality and technical capabilities. This study investigates whether these narratives align with observed market behavior. We construct a pipeline combining zero-shot NLP classification (BART-MNLI) with CP tensor decomposition to compare three spaces: (1) a claims matrix from 24 whitepapers across 10 semantic categories, (2) market statistics for 49 assets over two years of hourly data, and (3) latent factors from tensor decomposition (rank 2, 92.45% variance explained). Using Procrustes rotation and Tucker's congruence coefficient, we test alignment across 23 common entities.
  Results show weak alignment: claims-statistics (phi=0.341, p=0.332), claims-factors (phi=0.077, p=0.747), and statistics-factors (phi=0.197, p<0.001). The statistics-factors significance validates our methodology, confirming the pipeline detects relationships when present. Inter-model validation with DeBERTa-v3 yields 32% exact agreement but 67% top-3 agreement. Cross-sectional analysis reveals heterogeneous contributions: NEAR, MKR, ATOM show positive alignment while ENS, UNI, Bitcoin diverge most. Excluding Bitcoin confirms results are not driven by market dominance.
  We interpret findings as weak alignment between whitepaper narratives and market factor structure. Limited power (n=23) precludes distinguishing weak from no alignment, but strong alignment (phi>=0.70) can be confidently rejected. Implications for narrative economics and investment analysis are discussed.

*Yuxiang Wang,Hongyu Liu,Dekun Chen,Xueyao Zhang,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces VoxPrivacy, the first benchmark to assess interactional privacy in Speech Language Models (SLMs), addressing the challenge of adapting responses based on speaker identity to ensure privacy in multi-user environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs deployed in shared, multi-user environments must distinguish between users to maintain privacy and prevent revealing sensitive information across users (interactional privacy). Current benchmarks lack adequate focus on this critical aspect.

Method: The authors propose VoxPrivacy, a multi-tier benchmark for evaluating SLMs' ability to protect interactional privacy. They assess nine SLMs using a 32-hour bilingual dataset, real-world validation on Real-VoxPrivacy, and improved training with a 4,000-hour dataset.

Result: Most open-source models performed near random (50% accuracy) on privacy-related decisions, and while closed-source systems were better, they still struggled with proactive privacy inference. Fine-tuning with the large training set improved privacy-preserving abilities.

Conclusion: The VoxPrivacy benchmark provides a necessary framework for developing safer, speaker-aware SLMs. Publicly releasing the benchmark, training set, and fine-tuned model encourages further advancements in this area.

Abstract: As Speech Language Models (SLMs) transition from personal devices to shared, multi-user environments such as smart homes, a new challenge emerges: the model is expected to distinguish between users to manage information flow appropriately. Without this capability, an SLM could reveal one user's confidential schedule to another, a privacy failure we term interactional privacy. Thus, the ability to generate speaker-aware responses becomes essential for SLM safe deployment. Current SLM benchmarks test dialogue ability but overlook speaker identity. Multi-speaker benchmarks check who said what without assessing whether SLMs adapt their responses. Privacy benchmarks focus on globally sensitive data (e.g., bank passwords) while neglecting contextual privacy-sensitive information (e.g., a user's private appointment). To address this gap, we introduce VoxPrivacy, the first benchmark designed to evaluate interactional privacy in SLMs. VoxPrivacy spans three tiers of increasing difficulty, from following direct secrecy commands to proactively protecting privacy. Our evaluation of nine SLMs on a 32-hour bilingual dataset reveals a widespread vulnerability: most open-source models perform close to random chance (around 50% accuracy) on conditional privacy decisions, while even strong closed-source systems fall short on proactive privacy inference. We further validate these findings on Real-VoxPrivacy, a human-recorded subset, confirming that failures observed on synthetic data persist in real speech. Finally, we demonstrate a viable path forward: by fine-tuning on a new 4,000-hour training set, we improve privacy-preserving abilities while maintaining robustness. To support future work, we release the VoxPrivacy benchmark, the large-scale training set, and the fine-tuned model to foster the development of safer and more context-aware SLMs.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper questions the suitability of transformer models in constrained environments and presents alternatives to improve computational efficiency for Streaming ASR without heavily impacting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the relevance and efficiency of transformer architectures in constrained tasks, particularly given their high computational requirements and unsuitability for streaming applications.

Method: Combines deformable convolution in place of self-attention and evaluates its impact on reducing computational costs and maintaining performance in Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition.

Result: Demonstrated that deformable convolution can reduce computational cost, and self-attention mechanisms can be removed entirely without major performance degradation in ASR.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures may not always be ideal for constrained tasks, and alternative strategies like deformable convolution can achieve efficiency with comparable performance in Streaming ASR.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures are the most used architectures in many deep learning fields like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision or Speech processing. It may encourage the direct use of Transformers in the constrained tasks, without questioning whether it will yield the same benefits as in standard tasks.  Given specific constraints, it is essential to evaluate the relevance of transformer models. This work questions the suitability of transformers for specific domains. We argue that the high computational requirements and latency issues associated with these models do not align well with streaming applications. Our study promotes the search for alternative strategies to improve efficiency without sacrificing performance.  In light of this observation, our paper critically examines the usefulness of transformer architecture in such constrained environments. As a first attempt, we show that the computational cost for Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can be reduced using deformable convolution instead of Self-Attention. Furthermore, we show that Self-Attention mechanisms can be entirely removed and not replaced, without observing significant degradation in the Word Error Rate.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIR-Mega-Speech, a 117.5-hour corpus using LibriSpeech data combined with simulated room impulse responses, offering detailed acoustic annotations and reproducible results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in comparing reverberant speech methods due to limited or absent acoustic annotations and reproducibility in existing corpora.

Method: Created a corpus by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with approximately 5,000 simulated room impulse responses, providing acoustic metrics (RT60, DRR, C50) and scripts to recreate the dataset and evaluation results.

Result: Using Whisper small, reverberant speech was found to increase WER by 2.50 percentage points (48% relative degradation) and showed correlation with RT60 and DRR as expected.

Conclusion: The standardized corpus facilitates transparent and reproducible benchmarking of reverberant speech recognition methods, ensuring research results are verifiable.

Abstract: Despite decades of research on reverberant speech, comparing methods remains difficult because most corpora lack per-file acoustic annotations or provide limited documentation for reproduction. We present RIR-Mega-Speech, a corpus of approximately 117.5 hours created by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with roughly 5,000 simulated room impulse responses from the RIR-Mega collection. Every file includes RT60, direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity index ($C_{50}$) computed from the source RIR using clearly defined, reproducible procedures. We also provide scripts to rebuild the dataset and reproduce all evaluation results.
  Using Whisper small on 1,500 paired utterances, we measure 5.20% WER (95% CI: 4.69--5.78) on clean speech and 7.70% (7.04--8.35) on reverberant versions, corresponding to a paired increase of 2.50 percentage points (2.06--2.98). This represents a 48% relative degradation. WER increases monotonically with RT60 and decreases with DRR, consistent with prior perceptual studies. While the core finding that reverberation harms recognition is well established, we aim to provide the community with a standardized resource where acoustic conditions are transparent and results can be verified independently. The repository includes one-command rebuild instructions for both Windows and Linux environments.

Method: The authors use multiple kernel similarity measurements, specifically four polynomial and one degree-one arccosine kernel, to create sparse graphs emphasizing local similarities for spectral clustering.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates exceptional unsupervised speaker diarization performance on DIHARD-III, AMI, and VoxConverse corpora.

Conclusion: The approach shows that principled graph construction using kernel similarities is effective for unsupervised speaker diarization, setting a new benchmark in performance and providing open-source implementations for further research.

Abstract: Speaker diarization aims to segment audio recordings into regions corresponding to individual speakers. Although unsupervised speaker diarization is inherently challenging, the prospect of identifying speaker regions without pretraining or weak supervision motivates research on clustering techniques. In this work, we share the notable observation that measuring multiple kernel similarities of speaker embeddings to thereafter craft a sparse graph for spectral clustering in a principled manner is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performances in a fully unsupervised setting. Specifically, we consider four polynomial kernels and a degree one arccosine kernel to measure similarities in speaker embeddings, using which sparse graphs are constructed in a principled manner to emphasize local similarities. Experiments show the proposed approach excels in unsupervised speaker diarization over a variety of challenging environments in the DIHARD-III, AMI, and VoxConverse corpora. To encourage further research, our implementations are available at https://github.com/nikhilraghav29/MK-SGC-SC.

### [380] [A scalable flow-based approach to mitigate topological freezing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20708)
*Claudio Bonanno,Andrea Bulgarelli,Elia Cellini,Alessandro Nada,Dario Panfalone,Davide Vadacchino,Lorenzo Verzichelli*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of topological freezing in lattice gauge theories by proposing a flow-based strategy that uses Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) to transition configurations from open boundary conditions to periodic ensembles, validated through reproducible results for topological susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of topological freezing in lattice gauge theories as they approach the continuum limit, where standard simulations suffer from high autocorrelations in topological observables.

Method: The method involves employing a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that uses non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates and localized defect coupling layers to transport configurations while minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between forward and reverse path measures for efficiency.

Result: The SNF method achieves better performance compared to purely stochastic approaches at similar computational costs, and it correctly reproduces reference values for topological susceptibility.

Conclusion: The proposed SNF-based strategy effectively resolves the issues of boundary artifacts and topological freezing, providing a scalable approach to lattice gauge theories with improved efficiency and validated outcomes.

Abstract: As lattice gauge theories with non-trivial topological features are driven towards the continuum limit, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suffer for topological freezing, i.e., a dramatic growth of autocorrelations in topological observables. A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.

### [381] [Convergence Analysis of Randomized Subspace Normalized SGD under Heavy-Tailed Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20399)
*Gaku Omiya,Pierre-Louis Poirion,Akiko Takeda*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes randomized subspace methods for nonconvex optimization, proposing RS-SGD with high-probability bounds and introducing RS-NSGD for improved convergence in heavy-tailed noise scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonconvex optimization often struggles with high-probability guarantees under sub-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise scenarios, motivating the need for robust randomized methods.

Method: The paper proves high-probability convergence for RS-SGD with sub-Gaussian noise and introduces RS-NSGD, incorporating direction normalization, with convergence guarantees even under bounded $p$-th moment noise.

Result: RS-SGD achieves high-probability convergence comparable to in-expectation methods, while RS-NSGD demonstrates superior oracle complexity under challenging noise conditions.

Conclusion: Randomized subspace methods improve the robustness and convergence in nonconvex optimization, especially under heavy-tailed noise.

Abstract: Randomized subspace methods reduce per-iteration cost; however, in nonconvex optimization, most analyses are expectation-based, and high-probability bounds remain scarce even under sub-Gaussian noise. We first prove that randomized subspace SGD (RS-SGD) admits a high-probability convergence bound under sub-Gaussian noise, achieving the same order of oracle complexity as prior in-expectation results. Motivated by the prevalence of heavy-tailed gradients in modern machine learning, we then propose randomized subspace normalized SGD (RS-NSGD), which integrates direction normalization into subspace updates. Assuming the noise has bounded $p$-th moments, we establish both in-expectation and high-probability convergence guarantees, and show that RS-NSGD can achieve better oracle complexity than full-dimensional normalized SGD.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper develops randomized feasibility algorithms with adaptive stepsizes for constrained optimization problems, achieving strong convergence rates and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of minimizing objectives under constraints defined by complex intersections of lower-level convex function sets, where projection onto these constraints is not straightforward.

Method: Randomized feasibility algorithms employing Polyak steps, random sampling of constraints per iteration, and adaptive stepsize schemes for both smooth and nonsmooth objectives.

Result: The algorithms demonstrate linear convergence for smooth objectives, $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate for nonsmooth objectives, and geometrical infeasibility reduction with computational efficiency validated through simulations (e.g., QCQP and SVM).

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide robust and adaptive solutions for constrained optimization problems, outperforming existing algorithms in specific simulations and achieving optimal theoretical rates.

Abstract: We consider minimizing an objective function subject to constraints defined by the intersection of lower-level sets of convex functions. We study two cases: (i) strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objective function and (ii) convex but possibly nonsmooth objective function. To deal with the constraints that are not easy to project on, we use a randomized feasibility algorithm with Polyak steps and a random number of sampled constraints per iteration, while taking (sub)gradient steps to minimize the objective function. For case (i), we prove linear convergence in expectation of the objective function values to any prescribed tolerance using an adaptive stepsize. For case (ii), we develop a fully problem parameter-free and adaptive stepsize scheme that yields an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ worst-case rate in expectation. The infeasibility of the iterates decreases geometrically with the number of feasibility updates almost surely, while for the averaged iterates, we establish an expected lower bound on the function values relative to the optimal value that depends on the distribution for the random number of sampled constraints. For certain choices of sample-size growth, optimal rates are achieved. Finally, simulations on a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) problem and Support Vector Machines (SVM) demonstrate the computational efficiency of our algorithm compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

*Temple He,Jaeha Lee,Hirosi Ooguri*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper develops a reinforcement learning algorithm to analyze holographic entropy cones, confirming results for N=3 and probing unresolved cases for N=6.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the structure and boundaries of holographic entropy cones, addressing unresolved questions about graph realizations and inequalities.

Method: The authors utilize a reinforcement learning algorithm to search for graph realizations matching entropy vectors and approximate target vectors outside the cone.

Result: For N=3, the algorithm rediscovered known inequalities. For N=6, realizations were found for 3 of 6 extreme rays, while evidence suggests the remaining 3 are not realizable.

Conclusion: This method enhances understanding of holographic entropy cones, indicating new inequalities for N=6 and verifying realizability in some cases.

Abstract: We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm to study the holographic entropy cone. Given a target entropy vector, our algorithm searches for a graph realization whose min-cut entropies match the target vector. If the target vector does not admit such a graph realization, it must lie outside the cone, in which case the algorithm finds a graph whose corresponding entropy vector most nearly approximates the target and allows us to probe the location of the facets. For the $\sf N=3$ cone, we confirm that our algorithm successfully rediscovers monogamy of mutual information beginning with a target vector outside the holographic entropy cone. We then apply the algorithm to the $\sf N=6$ cone, analyzing the 6 "mystery" extreme rays of the subadditivity cone from arXiv:2412.15364 that satisfy all known holographic entropy inequalities yet lacked graph realizations. We found realizations for 3 of them, proving they are genuine extreme rays of the holographic entropy cone, while providing evidence that the remaining 3 are not realizable, implying unknown holographic inequalities exist for $\sf N=6$.

*Mohsen Hatami,Van Tuan Pham,Hozefa Lakadawala,Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates security threats to AI agents in cyber-physical systems (CPS), particularly focusing on interactions with the environment, deepfake-driven attacks, and vulnerabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents are increasingly integrated into CPS, they face novel security risks like deepfake and semantic manipulation attacks, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of these challenges.

Method: The authors review literature under the SENTINEL framework, study threat characterization, feasibility, defenses, and validation through an end-to-end case study of smart grids.

Result: The research identifies timing, noise, and false-positive costs as constraints for deployable defenses, showing that detection mechanisms alone are inadequate for safety-critical CPS.

Conclusion: Trustworthy AI in CPS requires provenance- and physics-based trust mechanisms, layered defense systems, and further research into unresolved challenges.

Abstract: The increasing integration of AI agents into cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduces new security risks that extend beyond traditional cyber or physical threat models. Recent advances in generative AI enable deepfake and semantic manipulation attacks that can compromise agent perception, reasoning, and interaction with the physical environment, while emerging protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) further expand the attack surface through dynamic tool use and cross-domain context sharing. This survey provides a comprehensive review of security threats targeting AI agents in CPS, with a particular focus on environmental interactions, deepfake-driven attacks, and MCP-mediated vulnerabilities. We organize the literature using the SENTINEL framework, a lifecycle-aware methodology that integrates threat characterization, feasibility analysis under CPS constraints, defense selection, and continuous validation. Through an end-to-end case study grounded in a real-world smart grid deployment, we quantitatively illustrate how timing, noise, and false-positive costs constrain deployable defenses, and why detection mechanisms alone are insufficient as decision authorities in safety-critical CPS. The survey highlights the role of provenance- and physics-grounded trust mechanisms and defense-in-depth architectures, and outlines open challenges toward trustworthy AI-enabled CPS.

*Mohamed Amine Legheraba,Nour Rachdi,Maria Gradinariu Potop-Butucaru,Sébastien Tixeuil*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the resilience of the Elevator protocol under Byzantine adversaries and introduces LIFT, a more robust alternative that secures hub selection cryptographically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of decentralized applications like federated learning and blockchain by addressing vulnerabilities in peer sampling protocols against Byzantine adversaries.

Method: The study analyzes the Elevator protocol under Byzantine adversaries and proposes LIFT, a new protocol using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for hub selection to ensure robustness.

Result: The evaluation reveals that the Elevator protocol is vulnerable to even a small (2%) fraction of Byzantine nodes, while LIFT can withstand adversarial infiltration with up to 10% Byzantine nodes.

Conclusion: Incorporating secure randomness in hub selection, as done by LIFT, is critical for building robust decentralized systems resistant to Byzantine adversaries.

Abstract: Recently, a novel peer sampling protocol, Elevator, was introduced to construct network topologies tailored for emerging decentralized applications such as federated learning and blockchain. Elevator builds hub-based topologies in a fully decentralized manner, randomly selecting hubs among participating nodes. These hubs, acting as central nodes connected to the entire network, can be leveraged to accelerate message dissemination. Simulation results have shown that Elevator converges rapidly (within 3--4 cycles) and exhibits robustness against crash failures and churn. However, its resilience to Byzantine adversaries has not been investigated. In this work, we provide the first evaluation of Elevator under Byzantine adversaries and show that even a small fraction (2%) of Byzantine nodes is sufficient to subvert the network. As a result, we introduce LIFT, a new protocol that extends Elevator by employing a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for hub selection, thereby mitigating Byzantine manipulation. In contrast, LIFT withstands adversarial infiltration and remains robust with up to 10% Byzantine nodes. These results highlight the necessity of secure randomness in decentralized hub formation and position LIFT as a more reliable building block for Byzantine-resilient decentralized systems.

### [386] [SemBind: Binding Diffusion Watermarks to Semantics Against Black-Box Forgery Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20310)
*Xin Zhang,Zijin Yang,Kejiang Chen,Linfeng Ma,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'SemBind,' a framework to defend against forgery attacks on latent-based watermarks by binding watermark signals to image semantics. It improves security while retaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a growing challenge of black-box forgery attacks in latent-based watermarks, which threaten trust and provenance of generated images.

Method: The SemBind framework uses a semantic masker learned through contrastive learning to create near-invariant codes for prompts. The codes are applied to modulate latent vectors before watermarking, making these watermarks robust against forgery.

Result: SemBind is compatible with existing watermarking schemes and effectively reduces black-box forgery risks. It maintains image quality and offers adjustable robustness-security trade-offs.

Conclusion: SemBind enhances the security and robustness of latent-based watermarks, offering an effective defense mechanism against forgery attacks while remaining practical and efficient.

Abstract: Latent-based watermarks, integrated into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs), simplify detection and attribution of generated images. However, recent black-box forgery attacks, where an attacker needs at least one watermarked image and black-box access to the provider's model, can embed the provider's watermark into images not produced by the provider, posing outsized risk to provenance and trust. We propose SemBind, the first defense framework for latent-based watermarks that resists black-box forgery by binding latent signals to image semantics via a learned semantic masker. Trained with contrastive learning, the masker yields near-invariant codes for the same prompt and near-orthogonal codes across prompts; these codes are reshaped and permuted to modulate the target latent before any standard latent-based watermark. SemBind is generally compatible with existing latent-based watermarking schemes and keeps image quality essentially unchanged, while a simple mask-ratio parameter offers a tunable trade-off between anti-forgery strength and robustness. Across four mainstream latent-based watermark methods, our SemBind-enabled anti-forgery variants markedly reduce false acceptance under black-box forgery while providing a controllable robustness-security balance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UnlearnShield is proposed to counter privacy risks in machine unlearning processes by reducing inversion risk while preserving accuracy and forgetting efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy vulnerabilities in machine unlearning, particularly the threat of adversaries reconstructing data intended for erasure.

Method: Introduce UnlearnShield, utilizing directional perturbations in the cosine representation space and a constraint module to balance model accuracy, forgetting efficacy, and risk reduction.

Result: Experiments validate UnlearnShield's ability to achieve a trade-off among privacy protection, accuracy, and forgetting efficiency.

Conclusion: UnlearnShield provides a practical solution to privacy threats in machine unlearning, enhancing model safety while maintaining functional accuracy and effectiveness.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that aims to remove the influence of specific data from trained models, thereby enhancing privacy protection. However, recent research has uncovered critical privacy vulnerabilities, showing that adversaries can exploit unlearning inversion to reconstruct data that was intended to be erased. Despite the severity of this threat, dedicated defenses remain lacking. To address this gap, we propose UnlearnShield, the first defense specifically tailored to counter unlearning inversion. UnlearnShield introduces directional perturbations in the cosine representation space and regulates them through a constraint module to jointly preserve model accuracy and forgetting efficacy, thereby reducing inversion risk while maintaining utility. Experiments demonstrate that it achieves a good trade-off among privacy protection, accuracy, and forgetting.

*Holly Trikilis,Pasindu Marasinghe,Fariza Rashid,Suranga Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for phishing URL detection, leveraging a Least-to-Most prompting mechanism for better reasoning and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) in phishing URL detection, addressing a critical need for accurate methods because phishing remains a major attack vector.

Method: The authors introduce a methodology that uses a Least-to-Most prompting framework combined with an "answer sensitivity" mechanism, allowing iterative and improved reasoning for URL classification. They conduct comparative evaluations across datasets and models.

Result: The proposed framework outperformes one-shot baselines and achieves performance comparable to supervised models, even with much less training data. Improved reasoning from the iterative approach contributed to better phishing detection.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that their simple prompting strategy enhances phishing URL detection accuracy significantly with minimal training needs, establishing it as an effective and efficient alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Phishing continues to be one of the most prevalent attack vectors, making accurate classification of phishing URLs essential. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising results in phishing URL detection. However, their reasoning capabilities that enabled such performance remain underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Least-to-Most prompting framework for phishing URL detection. In particular, we introduce an "answer sensitivity" mechanism that guides Least-to-Most's iterative approach to enhance reasoning and yield higher prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing against a one-shot approach and a supervised model. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the one-shot baseline while achieving performance comparable to that of the supervised model, despite requiring significantly less training data. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis highlights how the iterative reasoning enabled by Least-to-Most, and reinforced by our answer sensitivity mechanism, drives these performance gains. Overall, we show that this simple yet powerful prompting strategy consistently outperforms both one-shot and supervised approaches, despite requiring minimal training or few-shot guidance. Our experimental setup can be found in our Github repository github.sydney.edu.au/htri0928/least-to-most-phishing-detection.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal multi-agent framework for ransomware classification, utilizing auto-encoder based feature extraction and transformer-based methods to achieve high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ransomware detection methods often fall short due to limited scope; this paper aims to provide a robust and adaptive solution.

Method: The approach uses a specialized agent for each data type (static, dynamic, network), auto-encoder based feature extraction, agentic feedback loops, and fusion agents integrated with transformer-based classifiers.

Result: The model demonstrated superior performance on large-scale datasets, achieving up to 0.936 in Macro-F1 for ransomware family classification with stable convergence and improvement in agent quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an effective solution for ransomware detection and classification, showing promise for improving real-world defense systems.

Abstract: Ransomware has become one of the most serious cybersecurity threats causing major financial losses and operational disruptions worldwide.Traditional detection methods such as static analysis, heuristic scanning and behavioral analysis often fall short when used alone. To address these limitations, this paper presents multimodal multi agent ransomware analysis framework designed for ransomware classification. Proposed multimodal multiagent architecture combines information from static, dynamic and network sources. Each data type is handled by specialized agent that uses auto encoder based feature extraction. These representations are then integrated through a fusion agent. After that fused representation are used by transformer based classifier. It identifies the specific ransomware family. The agents interact through an interagent feedback mechanism that iteratively refines feature representations by suppressing low confidence information. The framework was evaluated on large scale datasets containing thousands of ransomware and benign samples. Multiple experiments were conducted on ransomware dataset. It outperforms single modality and nonadaptive fusion baseline achieving improvement of up to 0.936 in Macro-F1 for family classification and reducing calibration error. Over 100 epochs, the agentic feedback loop displays a stable monotonic convergence leading to over +0.75 absolute improvement in terms of agent quality and a final composite score of around 0.88 without fine tuning of the language models. Zeroday ransomware detection remains family dependent on polymorphism and modality disruptions. Confidence aware abstention enables reliable real world deployment by favoring conservativeand trustworthy decisions over forced classification. The findings indicate that proposed approach provides a practical andeffective path toward improving real world ransomware defense systems.

Motivation: To address security vulnerabilities in large language models transitioning to enterprise use, emphasizing the need for better threat detection and response safety.

Method: Benchmarked five standard Llama models and five Llama Guard variants against the OWASP Top 10 framework using adversarial prompts and NVIDIA A30 GPUs. Performance was measured in terms of threat detection accuracy, response safety, and computational efficiency.

Result: The compact Llama-Guard-3-1B model achieved a 76% threat detection rate with minimal latency, while larger models like Llama-3.1-8B achieved 0% accuracy but had significantly longer inference times.

Conclusion: Smaller and specialized models are more effective for security-related tasks, and an open-source dataset for reproducible research is provided.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) move from research prototypes to enterprise systems, their security vulnerabilities pose serious risks to data privacy and system integrity. This study benchmarks various Llama model variants against the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications framework, evaluating threat detection accuracy, response safety, and computational overhead. Using the FABRIC testbed with NVIDIA A30 GPUs, we tested five standard Llama models and five Llama Guard variants on 100 adversarial prompts covering ten vulnerability categories. Our results reveal significant differences in security performance: the compact Llama-Guard-3-1B model achieved the highest detection rate of 76% with minimal latency (0.165s per test), whereas base models such as Llama-3.1-8B failed to detect threats (0% accuracy) despite longer inference times (0.754s). We observe an inverse relationship between model size and security effectiveness, suggesting that smaller, specialized models often outperform larger general-purpose ones in security tasks. Additionally, we provide an open-source benchmark dataset including adversarial prompts, threat labels, and attack metadata to support reproducible research in AI security, [1].

*Jeremy Foote,Deepak Kumar,Bedadyuti Jha,Ryan Funkhouser,Loizos Bitsikokos,Hitesh Goel,Hsuen-Chi Chiu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of generative AI chatbots in rehabilitating users who post toxic content online but finds no significant change in behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore non-punitive, rehabilitative approaches to addressing toxic online behavior, given its prevalence and the challenges of engaging with aggressive users directly.

Method: The method involved a large-scale field experiment with 893 Reddit users who had recently posted toxic content, inviting them to engage in conversations with AI chatbots, followed by qualitative analysis of these interactions.

Result: The result shows many participants engaged in good faith discussions and occasionally expressed remorse. However, no significant reduction in toxic behavior was observed in the following month compared to a control group.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while generative AI chatbots can facilitate meaningful conversations with toxic users, their long-term impact on reducing toxic behavior remains uncertain, and further research is needed to understand and enhance effectiveness.

Abstract: Generative AI chatbots have proven surprisingly effective at persuading people to change their beliefs and attitudes in lab settings. However, the practical implications of these findings are not yet clear. In this work, we explore the impact of rehabilitative conversations with generative AI chatbots on users who share toxic content online. Toxic behaviors -- like insults or threats of violence, are widespread in online communities. Strategies to deal with toxic behavior are typically punitive, such as removing content or banning users. Rehabilitative approaches are rarely attempted, in part due to the emotional and psychological cost of engaging with aggressive users. In collaboration with seven large Reddit communities, we conducted a large-scale field experiment (N=893) to invite people who had recently posted toxic content to participate in conversations with AI chatbots. A qualitative analysis of the conversations shows that many participants engaged in good faith and even expressed remorse or a desire to change. However, we did not observe a significant change in toxic behavior in the following month compared to a control group. We discuss possible explanations for our findings, as well as theoretical and practical implications based on our results.

*Samuel Rhys Cox,Joel Wester,Niels van Berkel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study explores how different feedback styles in conversational agents impact user perceptions and intentions, balancing reactance and engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates how to design feedback styles in conversational agents to reduce reactance and improve engagement, given their growing role in behavior change interventions.

Method: The researchers compare user reactions to three feedback styles – 'Direct', 'Politeness', and 'Verbal Leakage' – in a controlled study.

Result: 'Politeness' showed lower reactance and higher behavioural intentions but lacked engagement; 'Direct' led to more reactance and lower intentions; 'Verbal Leakage' triggered reactance but increased surprise, engagement, and humor.

Conclusion: 'Verbal Leakage' presents a novel feedback mechanism that balances engagement and reactance, suggesting new design opportunities for conversational agents.

Abstract: As conversational agents become increasingly common in behaviour change interventions, understanding optimal feedback delivery mechanisms becomes increasingly important. However, choosing a style that both lessens psychological reactance (perceived threats to freedom) while simultaneously eliciting feelings of surprise and engagement represents a complex design problem. We explored how three different feedback styles: 'Direct', 'Politeness', and 'Verbal Leakage' (slips or disfluencies to reveal a desired behaviour) affect user perceptions and behavioural intentions. Matching expectations from literature, the 'Direct' chatbot led to lower behavioural intentions and higher reactance, while the 'Politeness' chatbot evoked higher behavioural intentions and lower reactance. However, 'Politeness' was also seen as unsurprising and unengaging by participants. In contrast, 'Verbal Leakage' evoked reactance, yet also elicited higher feelings of surprise, engagement, and humour. These findings highlight that effective feedback requires navigating trade-offs between user reactance and engagement, with novel approaches such as 'Verbal Leakage' offering promising alternative design opportunities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven learning systems lack adaptability to users' cognitive and physiological states, making it difficult to support individualized learning needs.

Method: GuideAI leverages real-time biosensory feedback (e.g., eye gaze, heart rate, posture) and employs adaptive strategies to adjust learning content, pacing, and cognitive interventions. It also provides multi-modal learning support.

Result: The framework demonstrated significant improvements in problem-solving, knowledge recall, and reduced cognitive load in a preliminary study involving 25 participants.

Conclusion: GuideAI effectively enhances LLM-based learning by integrating real-time feedback and cognition-aware adaptive methods, enabling a more personalized and scalable educational experience.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful learning tools, but they lack awareness of learners' cognitive and physiological states, limiting their adaptability to the user's learning style. Contemporary learning techniques primarily focus on structured learning paths, knowledge tracing, and generic adaptive testing but fail to address real-time learning challenges driven by cognitive load, attention fluctuations, and engagement levels. Building on findings from a formative user study (N=66), we introduce GuideAI, a multi-modal framework that enhances LLM-driven learning by integrating real-time biosensory feedback including eye gaze tracking, heart rate variability, posture detection, and digital note-taking behavior. GuideAI dynamically adapts learning content and pacing through cognitive optimizations (adjusting complexity based on learning progress markers), physiological interventions (breathing guidance and posture correction), and attention-aware strategies (redirecting focus using gaze analysis). Additionally, GuideAI supports diverse learning modalities, including text-based, image-based, audio-based, and video-based instruction, across varied knowledge domains. A preliminary study (N = 25) assessed GuideAI's impact on knowledge retention and cognitive load through standardized assessments. The results show statistically significant improvements in both problem-solving capability and recall-based knowledge assessments. Participants also experienced notable reductions in key NASA-TLX measures including mental demand, frustration levels, and effort, while simultaneously reporting enhanced perceived performance. These findings demonstrate GuideAI's potential to bridge the gap between current LLM-based learning systems and individualized learner needs, paving the way for adaptive, cognition-aware education at scale.

### [396] [Bias-Reduced Estimation of Finite Mixtures: An Application to Latent Group Structures in Panel Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20197)
*Raphaël Langevin*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper finds that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for finite mixtures suffers bias due to outliers and component overlaps, proposing a classification-mixture likelihood method that reduces bias and improves finite-sample performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias in finite mixture maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) caused by outliers and overlap between mixture components, which affect econometric analyses.

Method: The study introduces a classification-mixture likelihood function using a consistent classifier to minimize estimation bias, derives its asymptotic distribution, and tests its efficacy through Monte Carlo simulations and empirical application.

Result: Findings highlight that the proposed method outperforms standard MLE in terms of bias and mean squared errors. An empirical test using health data shows a 17.6% improvement in prediction accuracy over MLE.

Conclusion: The classification-mixture approach effectively reduces bias, achieves oracle efficiency under certain conditions, and enhances predictive performance over standard MLE methods.

Abstract: Finite mixture models are widely used in econometric analyses to capture unobserved heterogeneity. This paper shows that maximum likelihood estimation of finite mixtures of parametric densities can suffer from substantial finite-sample bias in all parameters under mild regularity conditions. The bias arises from the influence of outliers in component densities with unbounded or large support and increases with the degree of overlap among mixture components. I show that maximizing the classification-mixture likelihood function, equipped with a consistent classifier, yields parameter estimates that are less biased than those obtained by standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). I then derive the asymptotic distribution of the resulting estimator and provide conditions under which oracle efficiency is achieved. Monte Carlo simulations show that conventional mixture MLE exhibits pronounced finite-sample bias, which diminishes as the sample size or the statistical distance between component densities tends to infinity. The simulations further show that the proposed estimation strategy generally outperforms standard MLE in finite samples in terms of both bias and mean squared errors under relatively weak assumptions. An empirical application to latent group panel structures using health administrative data shows that the proposed approach reduces out-of-sample prediction error by approximately 17.6% relative to the best results obtained from standard MLE procedures.

### [397] [Exact Graph Learning via Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20589)
*Lucas Kook,Søren Wengel Mogensen*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to infer graph structures using nonparametric methods and integer programming, leading to improved accuracy and scalability in detecting causal relationships in complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing graph learning methods, which often rely on restrictive assumptions, approximate formulations, or are sensitive to assumption violations.

Method: Proposes a nonparametric graph learning framework using conditional independence testing and integer programming, providing globally optimal solutions and efficient encodings for larger graphs.

Result: The proposed method achieves faster performance than existing exact methods and state-of-the-art results on both simulated and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: This framework offers a precise, scalable solution to graph learning problems and is implemented in the R package 'glip' for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Learning the dependence structure among variables in complex systems is a central problem across medical, natural, and social sciences. These structures can be naturally represented by graphs, and the task of inferring such graphs from data is known as graph learning or as causal discovery if the graphs are given a causal interpretation. Existing approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions about the data-generating process, employ greedy oracle algorithms, or solve approximate formulations of the graph learning problem. As a result, they are either sensitive to violations of central assumptions or fail to guarantee globally optimal solutions. We address these limitations by introducing a nonparametric graph learning framework based on nonparametric conditional independence testing and integer programming. We reformulate the graph learning problem as an integer-programming problem and prove that solving the integer-programming problem provides a globally optimal solution to the original graph learning problem. Our method leverages efficient encodings of graphical separation criteria, enabling the exact recovery of larger graphs than was previously feasible. We provide an implementation in the openly available R package 'glip' which supports learning (acyclic) directed (mixed) graphs and chain graphs. From the resulting output one can compute representations of the corresponding Markov equivalence classes or weak equivalence classes. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is faster than other existing exact graph learning procedures for a large fraction of instances and graphs of various sizes. GLIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated data and benchmark datasets across all aforementioned classes of graphs.

*Wenhao Zou,Yuwei Miao,Zhanyu Ma,Jun Xu,Jiuchong Gao,Jinghua Hao,Renqing He,Jingwen Xu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces LTS-VoiceAgent, a framework for enhancing real-time voice agents by enabling concurrent reasoning and response generation, outperforming traditional methods in terms of latency, accuracy, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of end-to-end models in deep reasoning and the high latency of cascaded pipelines used in real-time voice agents, which are unable to mimic the natural conversational flow of human listeners who can think while listening.

Method: The paper proposes LTS-VoiceAgent, a novel framework using a Dynamic Semantic Trigger for detecting meaningful prefixes and a Dual-Role Stream Orchestrator to manage parallel processing between a Thinker (background reasoning) and a Speaker (foreground speculative response generation).

Result: LTS-VoiceAgent achieves better accuracy-latency-efficiency trade-offs compared to standard cascaded baselines and other streaming strategies across various benchmarks, including VERA, Spoken-MQA, BigBenchAudio, and a new Pause-and-Repair benchmark.

Conclusion: This framework offers a significant advancement in real-time voice agents by enabling simultaneous reasoning and speaking, addressing both the latency and reasoning gaps present in existing approaches.

Abstract: Real-time voice agents face a dilemma: end-to-end models often lack deep reasoning, while cascaded pipelines incur high latency by executing ASR, LLM reasoning, and TTS strictly in sequence, unlike human conversation where listeners often start thinking before the speaker finishes. Since cascaded architectures remain the dominant choice for complex tasks, existing cascaded streaming strategies attempt to reduce this latency via mechanical segmentation (e.g., fixed chunks, VAD-based splitting) or speculative generation, but they frequently either break semantic units or waste computation on predictions that must be rolled back. To address these challenges, we propose LTS-VoiceAgent, a Listen-Think-Speak framework that explicitly separates when to think from how to reason incrementally. It features a Dynamic Semantic Trigger to detect meaningful prefixes, and a Dual-Role Stream Orchestrator that coordinates a background Thinker (for state maintenance) and a foreground Speaker (for speculative solving). This parallel design enables "thinking while speaking" without blocking responses. We also introduce a Pause-and-Repair benchmark containing natural disfluencies to stress-test streaming robustness. Experiments across VERA, Spoken-MQA, BigBenchAudio, and our benchmark show that LTS-VoiceAgent achieves a stronger accuracy-latency-efficiency trade-off than serial cascaded baselines and existing streaming strategies.

*Xiangbo Wang,Wenbin Jiang,Jin Wang,Yubo You,Sheng Fang,Fei Wen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SwitchCodec introduces a neural audio codec with Residual Experts Vector Quantization (REVQ) to improve audio compression by dynamically activating expert quantizers based on audio complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency of fixed per-frame codebooks in neural audio compression when dealing with widely variable audio content.

Method: The authors propose a REVQ framework combining a shared quantizer with expert quantizers that are dynamically activated based on the input. Additionally, it offers a variable-bitrate mechanism for multi-bitrate operation without retraining.

Result: SwitchCodec outperforms existing baselines in both objective metrics and subjective listening evaluations.

Conclusion: By dynamically using expert quantizers and enabling adaptable bitrates, SwitchCodec achieves superior compression efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Recent neural audio compression models often rely on residual vector quantization for high-fidelity coding, but using a fixed number of per-frame codebooks is suboptimal for the wide variability of audio content-especially for signals that are either very simple or highly complex. To address this limitation, we propose SwitchCodec, a neural audio codec based on Residual Experts Vector Quantization (REVQ). REVQ combines a shared quantizer with dynamically routed expert quantizers that are activated according to the input audio, decoupling bitrate from codebook capacity and improving compression efficiency. This design ensures full training and utilization of each quantizer. In addition, a variable-bitrate mechanism adjusts the number of active expert quantizers at inference, enabling multi-bitrate operation without retraining. Experiments demonstrate that SwitchCodec surpasses existing baselines on both objective metrics and subjective listening tests.

### [400] [Self Voice Conversion as an Attack against Neural Audio Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20432)
*Yigitcan Özer,Wanying Ge,Zhe Zhang,Xin Wang,Junichi Yamagishi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper examines how self voice conversion—a technique remapping a speaker's voice while preserving their identity—can act as a threat to audio watermarking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to reassess audio watermarking systems' robustness against emerging threats like deep learning-based attacks, beyond traditional distortions.

Method: The researchers apply self voice conversion as a content-preserving attack on current watermarking methods, using voice conversion models.

Result: The study shows that self voice conversion significantly weakens the effectiveness of state-of-the-art audio watermarking systems.

Conclusion: Self voice conversion poses a critical security threat to modern audio watermarking technologies, warranting further study and improved defenses.

Abstract: Audio watermarking embeds auxiliary information into speech while maintaining speaker identity, linguistic content, and perceptual quality. Although recent advances in neural and digital signal processing-based watermarking methods have improved imperceptibility and embedding capacity, robustness is still primarily assessed against conventional distortions such as compression, additive noise, and resampling. However, the rise of deep learning-based attacks introduces novel and significant threats to watermark security. In this work, we investigate self voice conversion as a universal, content-preserving attack against audio watermarking systems. Self voice conversion remaps a speaker's voice to the same identity while altering acoustic characteristics through a voice conversion model. We demonstrate that this attack severely degrades the reliability of state-of-the-art watermarking approaches and highlight its implications for the security of modern audio watermarking techniques.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study evaluates three state-of-the-art TTS models against four detection systems, revealing variability in detection effectiveness across architectures, and suggesting a combined detection strategy for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by advancements in Text-to-Speech systems, which improve synthetic speech realism but complicate audio deepfake detection.

Method: The authors generated 12,000 synthetic audio samples using the Daily-Dialog dataset with TTS models (Dia2, Maya1, MeloTTS) and tested them against four detection frameworks encompassing semantic, structural, and signal-level analyses.

Result: Detection performance varied significantly across TTS architectures, with single-paradigm models often failing against specific synthesis mechanisms, particularly large language model-based generation.

Conclusion: Single-paradigm detection approaches are insufficient, and robust multi-view strategies combining complementary analysis methods are critical to counter evolving TTS-based deepfake threats effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems have substantially increased the realism of synthetic speech, raising new challenges for audio deepfake detection. This work presents a comparative evaluation of three state-of-the-art TTS models--Dia2, Maya1, and MeloTTS--representing streaming, LLM-based, and non-autoregressive architectures. A corpus of 12,000 synthetic audio samples was generated using the Daily-Dialog dataset and evaluated against four detection frameworks, including semantic, structural, and signal-level approaches. The results reveal significant variability in detector performance across generative mechanisms: models effective against one TTS architecture may fail against others, particularly LLM-based synthesis. In contrast, a multi-view detection approach combining complementary analysis levels demonstrates robust performance across all evaluated models. These findings highlight the limitations of single-paradigm detectors and emphasize the necessity of integrated detection strategies to address the evolving landscape of audio deepfake threats.

*Francisco Alcántara-Ávila,Andrés Cremades,Sergio Hoyas,Ricardo Vinuesa*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The study employs explainable deep learning (XDL) using SHAP to investigate turbulent kinetic energy transport in a turbulent channel flow, revealing hierarchical organization in near-wall turbulence and identifying dissipation as the dominant mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand physical mechanisms of turbulent kinetic energy transport and identify key structures governing the turbulent kinetic energy budget in channel flow, particularly through advanced, explainable AI methods.

Method: Adopting SHAP-based explainable deep learning (XDL), the study analyzes the high-importance structures for turbulent kinetic energy budget terms in a turbulent channel flow at $Re_τ=125$. The focus was both near-wall and outer flow regions.

Result: The study found hierarchical organization of near-wall turbulence structures dominated by dissipation. The importance was confined within dissipation structures in the viscous layer, while the outer layer exhibited a breakdown in the organization.

Conclusion: Dissipation organizes near-wall turbulence by constraining production and viscous diffusion hierarchically, but this hierarchy doesn’t extend to the outer channel layer, signaling fundamental differences in mechanisms governing different flow regions.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the physical mechanisms governing turbulent kinetic energy transport using explainable deep learning (XDL). An XDL model based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to identify and percolate high-importance structures for the evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy budget terms of a turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_τ= 125$. The results show that the important structures are predominantly located in the near-wall region and are more frequently associated with sweep-type events. In the viscous layer, the SHAP structures relevant for production and viscous diffusion are almost entirely contained within those relevant for dissipation, revealing a clear hierarchical organization of near-wall turbulence. In the outer layer, this hierarchical organization breaks down and only velocity-pressure-gradient correlation and turbulent transport SHAP structures remain, with a moderate spatial coincidence of approximately $60\%$. Finally, we show that none of the coherent structures classically studied in turbulence are capable of representing the mechanisms behind the various terms of the turbulent kinetic energy budget throughout the channel. These results reveal dissipation as the dominant organizing mechanism of near-wall turbulence, constraining production and viscous diffusion within a single structural hierarchy that breaks down in the outer layer.

TL;DR: This paper examines mixed-precision arithmetic in Neural-Network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), aiming for scalable and energy-efficient quantum simulations without loss of accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance computational performance, reduce memory usage, and improve energy efficiency in VMC simulations by leveraging low-precision arithmetic, amidst the rise of GPUs.

Method: The paper derives analytical error bounds introduced by reduced precision in Metropolis-Hastings MCMC and empirically tests them in VMC. It also explores portions of the quantum state sampling executable in half precision.

Result: The results show mixed-precision arithmetic can be effectively applied, with half-precision arithmetic maintaining accuracy in sampling, making simulations more scalable and resource-efficient.

Conclusion: Mixed-precision approaches are computationally viable for VMC, offering a path to more energy-efficient and scalable quantum simulations while ensuring accurate results.

Abstract: Scientific computing has long relied on double precision (64-bit floating point) arithmetic to guarantee accuracy in simulations of real-world phenomena. However, the growing availability of hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has made low-precision formats attractive due to their superior performance, reduced memory footprint, and improved energy efficiency. In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC. We demonstrate that significant portions of the algorithm, in particular, sampling the quantum state, can be executed in half precision without loss of accuracy. More broadly, this work provides a theoretical framework to assess the applicability of mixed-precision arithmetic in machine-learning approaches that rely on MCMC sampling. In the context of VMC, we additionally demonstrate the practical effectiveness of mixed-precision strategies, enabling more scalable and energy-efficient simulations of quantum many-body systems.

TL;DR: ELECTRAFI is a fast, efficient model for predicting periodic charge densities in crystalline materials, significantly outpacing current methods in both accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in existing methods for predicting periodic charge densities, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming, particularly when initializing density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Method: ELECTRAFI uses anisotropic Gaussians and their closed-form Fourier transforms to analytically evaluate plane-wave coefficients, avoiding the need for explicit real-space grid probing or other computationally intensive procedures. This allows efficient reconstruction of charge densities via a single inverse FFT.

Result: ELECTRAFI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and is up to 633 times faster than competing methods. It can reconstruct charge densities in a fraction of a second and reduces DFT calculation costs by approximately 20%.

Conclusion: ELECTRAFI demonstrates that combining accuracy with low inference costs can significantly enhance end-to-end efficiency in DFT calculations, emphasizing the importance of computational efficiency alongside accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce ELECTRAFI, a fast, end-to-end differentiable model for predicting periodic charge densities in crystalline materials. ELECTRAFI constructs anisotropic Gaussians in real space and exploits their closed-form Fourier transforms to analytically evaluate plane-wave coefficients via the Poisson summation formula. This formulation delegates non-local and periodic behavior to analytic transforms, enabling reconstruction of the full periodic charge density with a single inverse FFT. By avoiding explicit real-space grid probing, periodic image summation, and spherical harmonic expansions, ELECTRAFI matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy across periodic benchmarks while being up to $633 \times$ faster than the strongest competing method, reconstructing crystal charge densities in a fraction of a second. When used to initialize DFT calculations, ELECTRAFI reduces total DFT compute cost by up to ~20%, whereas slower charge density models negate savings due to high inference times. Our results show that accuracy and inference cost jointly determine end-to-end DFT speedups, and motivate our focus on efficiency.

Motivation: To address the need for generalizable and robust automated segmentation models in radiotherapy planning for NPC across imaging centers and modalities.

Method: SegRap2025 introduces two tasks with diverse datasets, evaluates segmentation models, and employs metrics like Dice Similarity Coefficient to test their performance across centers and modalities.

Result: GTV segmentation yielded DSC scores of 74.61% (internal testing) and 56.79% (external testing). LN CTV segmentation showed DSC scores of 60.24% (paired CT), 60.50% (ceCT-only), and 57.23% (ncCT-only).

Conclusion: SegRap2025 establishes a benchmark for assessing segmentation model robustness and generalization, aiding development toward automated radiotherapy planning systems in clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of Gross Tumor Volume (GTV), Lymph Node Clinical Target Volume (LN CTV), and Organ-at-Risk (OAR) from Computed Tomography (CT) scans is essential for precise radiotherapy planning in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Building upon SegRap2023, which focused on OAR and GTV segmentation using single-center paired non-contrast CT (ncCT) and contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) scans, the SegRap2025 challenge aims to enhance the generalizability and robustness of segmentation models across imaging centers and modalities. SegRap2025 comprises two tasks: Task01 addresses GTV segmentation using paired CT from the SegRap2023 dataset, with an additional external testing set to evaluate cross-center generalization, and Task02 focuses on LN CTV segmentation using multi-center training data and an unseen external testing set, where each case contains paired CT scans or a single modality, emphasizing both cross-center and cross-modality robustness. This paper presents the challenge setup and provides a comprehensive analysis of the solutions submitted by ten participating teams. For GTV segmentation task, the top-performing models achieved average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 74.61% and 56.79% on the internal and external testing cohorts, respectively. For LN CTV segmentation task, the highest average DSC values reached 60.24%, 60.50%, and 57.23% on paired CT, ceCT-only, and ncCT-only subsets, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that using a second-order quasi-Newton optimizer (SOAP) improves training efficiency and model performance in learned image compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training of learned image compression models faces difficulties such as gradient conflicts during optimization using standard first-order methods.

Method: The authors propose the use of a second-order quasi-Newton optimizer (SOAP) to resolve update conflicts and improve convergence for learned image compression.

Result: The method achieved faster training, more stable convergence, improved robustness to post-training quantization, and better final performance in compression models.

Conclusion: Second-order optimization like SOAP is effective and practical for improving the training and real-world deployability of learned image compression systems.

Abstract: Training learned image compression (LIC) models entails navigating a challenging optimization landscape defined by the fundamental trade-off between rate and distortion. Standard first-order optimizers, such as SGD and Adam, struggle with \emph{gradient conflicts} arising from competing objectives, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple utilization of a second-order quasi-Newton optimizer, \textbf{SOAP}, dramatically improves both training efficiency and final performance across diverse LICs. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that Newton preconditioning inherently resolves the intra-step and inter-step update conflicts intrinsic to the R-D objective, facilitating faster, more stable convergence. Beyond acceleration, we uncover a critical deployability benefit: second-order trained models exhibit significantly fewer activation and latent outliers. This substantially enhances robustness to post-training quantization. Together, these results establish second-order optimization, achievable as a seamless drop-in replacement of the imported optimizer, as a powerful, practical tool for advancing the efficiency and real-world readiness of LICs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRTX, a framework with software and hardware optimizations for efficient ray tracing of 3D Gaussian rendering, achieving better performance with minimal hardware costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in current Gaussian ray tracing methods, such as bloated acceleration structures and redundant node traversals, which degrade performance.

Method: GRTX combines a new approach to reduce BVH size by treating anisotropic Gaussians as unit spheres via ray space transformations, and hardware support for traversal checkpointing to eliminate redundant node visits.

Result: GRTX significantly enhances ray tracing performance compared to baseline methods, with minimal additional hardware cost.

Conclusion: GRTX efficiently optimizes 3D Gaussian-based ray tracing, improving performance while remaining cost-efficient and solving the limitations of current methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to its exceptional rendering performance and visual quality. While most existing methods rely on rasterization to render Gaussians, recent research has started investigating ray tracing approaches to overcome the fundamental limitations inherent in rasterization. However, current Gaussian ray tracing methods suffer from inefficiencies such as bloated acceleration structures and redundant node traversals, which greatly degrade ray tracing performance.
  In this work, we present GRTX, a set of software and hardware optimizations that enable efficient ray tracing for 3D Gaussian-based rendering. First, we introduce a novel approach for constructing streamlined acceleration structures for Gaussian primitives. Our key insight is that anisotropic Gaussians can be treated as unit spheres through ray space transformations, which substantially reduces BVH size and traversal overhead. Second, we propose dedicated hardware support for traversal checkpointing within ray tracing units. This eliminates redundant node visits during multi-round tracing by resuming traversal from checkpointed nodes rather than restarting from the root node in each subsequent round. Our evaluation shows that GRTX significantly improves ray tracing performance compared to the baseline ray tracing method with a negligible hardware cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend diffusion modeling from Euclidean settings to spherical domains, addressing the challenges of spherical geometry and stochastic processes.

Method: The authors map spatial Brownian motion to Gaussian processes in the frequency domain, derive frequency-domain stochastic differential equations, and analyze induced noise covariance and biases.

Result: The framework derives modified diffusion equations with geometry-dependent inductive bias and demonstrates differences between spatial and spectral score matching objectives.

Conclusion: An advanced framework for spherical data diffusion modeling is introduced, providing insights into the interplay of spatial and spectral domains with geometry-dependent considerations.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a principled framework for generative modeling via stochastic differential equations and time-reversed dynamics. Extending spectral diffusion approaches to spherical data, however, raises nontrivial geometric and stochastic issues that are absent in the Euclidean setting.
  In this work, we develop a diffusion modeling framework defined directly on finite-dimensional spherical harmonic representations of real-valued functions on the sphere. We show that the spherical discrete Fourier transform maps spatial Brownian motion to a constrained Gaussian process in the frequency domain with deterministic, generally non-isotropic covariance. This induces modified forward and reverse-time stochastic differential equations in the spectral domain.
  As a consequence, spatial and spectral score matching objectives are no longer equivalent, even in the band-limited setting, and the frequency-domain formulation introduces a geometry-dependent inductive bias. We derive the corresponding diffusion equations and characterize the induced noise covariance.

Motivation: To improve the real-time triggering, data reduction, and background discrimination in the CYGNO experiment, which generates large, sparse, megapixel images from its optical readout.

Method: 1. An unsupervised autoencoder learns pedestal noise patterns and identifies anomalies for effective data reduction.
2. A weakly supervised CWoLa framework trains a classifier to recognize nuclear-recoil patterns using mixed datasets.

Result: Unsupervised method retains 93% signal intensity while discarding 97.8% image area with a 25 ms inference time. The CWoLa framework identifies nuclear-recoil topologies near theoretical performance limits.

Conclusion: These machine-learning approaches effectively address the challenges of optical-readout TPC data processing, enabling high-efficiency data reduction and nuclear-recoil recognition.

Abstract: The CYGNO experiment employs an optical-readout Time Projection Chamber (TPC) to search for rare low-energy interactions using finely resolved scintillation images. While the optical readout provides rich topological information, it produces large, sparse megapixel images that challenge real-time triggering, data reduction, and background discrimination.
  We summarize two complementary machine-learning approaches developed within CYGNO. First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted. On real prototype data, the selected configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with ~25 ms per-frame inference time on a consumer GPU.
  Second, we report a weakly supervised application of the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) framework to data acquired with an Americium--Beryllium neutron source. Using only mixed AmBe and standard datasets (no event-level labels), a convolutional classifier learns to identify nuclear-recoil-like topologies. The achieved performance approaches the theoretical limit imposed by the mixture composition and isolates a high-score population with compact, approximately circular morphologies consistent with nuclear recoils.

### [410] [Cross-Country Learning for National Infectious Disease Forecasting Using European Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20771)
*Zacharias Komodromos,Kleanthis Malialis,Artemis Kontou,Panayiotis Kolios*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: The paper explores cross-country learning for infectious disease forecasting, training a model on data from multiple countries to address limitations of national data. Results highlight improved performance, focused on COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve infectious disease forecasting by overcoming the challenge of limited historical data at a national level, which hinders ML model performance.

Method: The authors use a cross-country learning approach, training ML models on time series data from multiple countries, and evaluate these on a specific country (Cyprus). They analyze effects of lookback window length and data augmentation on forecasting.

Result: The study finds that including data from other countries consistently enhances multi-step forecasting performance compared to models trained on national data alone.

Conclusion: Cross-country learning is beneficial for infectious disease forecasting in cases with insufficient national historical data and is broadly applicable to related public health problems.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of infectious disease incidence is critical for public health planning and timely intervention. While most data-driven forecasting approaches rely primarily on historical data from a single country, such data are often limited in length and variability, restricting the performance of machine learning (ML) models. In this work, we investigate a cross-country learning approach for infectious disease forecasting, in which a single model is trained on time series data from multiple countries and evaluated on a country of interest. This setting enables the model to exploit shared epidemic dynamics across countries and to benefit from an enlarged training set. We examine this approach through a case study on COVID-19 case forecasting in Cyprus, using surveillance data from European countries. We evaluate multiple ML models and analyse the impact of the lookback window length and cross-country `data augmentation' on multi-step forecasting performance. Our results show that incorporating data from other countries can lead to consistent improvements over models trained solely on national data. Although the empirical focus is on Cyprus and COVID-19, the proposed framework and findings are applicable to infectious disease forecasting more broadly, particularly in settings with limited national historical data.

*Parisa Fard Moshiri,Poonam Lohan,Burak Kantarci,Emil Janulewicz*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid forecast-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework that enhances Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement for Service Function Chaining (SFC) in Data Centers, optimizing resource allocation and reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in conventional static resource allocation in Service Function Chaining, which leads to issues in adapting to dynamic traffic loads and application demands in Data Centers.

Method: The approach integrates DRL for generating datasets on data center resource use and service demands, followed by deep learning forecasting models optimized using Optuna. Forecasting is combined into an ensemble for accurate prediction, enabling proactive placement of VNFs based on future resource availability.

Result: The proposed method improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical services (e.g., Augmented Reality from 30% to 50%) and achieves notable reductions in end-to-end latencies for services like VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming by 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8%, respectively.

Conclusion: The framework ensures better resource allocation, reduces contention, and caters more effectively to resource-intensive, latency-critical services, addressing critical challenges in dynamic SFC environments.

Abstract: Service Function Chaining (SFC) requires efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to satisfy diverse service requirements while maintaining high resource utilization in Data Centers (DCs). Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively. This strategy ensures more balanced resource allocation, and reduces contention.

*Yumou Liu,Zhenzhe Zheng,Jiang Rong,Yao Hu,Fan Wu,Guihai Chen*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper investigates flaws in paid promotion on content platforms and introduces a dual-objective optimization strategy to address issues, enhancing long-term recommendation model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the counterintuitive issue where promotion harms high-quality content by exposing it to suboptimal audiences, leading to degraded future recommendations.

Method: The method involves recasting promotion as a dual-objective optimization, introducing a gradient coverage objective tied to Fisher Information, using a two-stage auto-bidding algorithm with Lagrange duality, and implementing a confidence-gated heuristic for missing labels.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms baselines in extensive experiments, achieving better AUC/LogLoss, adhering to budgets, and remaining effective with gradient approximations.

Conclusion: Strategic, information-aware content promotion can significantly improve the long-term performance of recommendation systems, as opposed to naive strategies focused solely on maximizing impressions.

Abstract: Modern content platforms offer paid promotion to mitigate cold start by allocating exposure via auctions. Our empirical analysis reveals a counterintuitive flaw in this paradigm: while promotion rescues low-to-medium quality content, it can harm high-quality content by forcing exposure to suboptimal audiences, polluting engagement signals and downgrading future recommendation. We recast content promotion as a dual-objective optimization that balances short-term value acquisition with long-term model improvement. To make this tractable at bid time in content promotion, we introduce a decomposable surrogate objective, gradient coverage, and establish its formal connection to Fisher Information and optimal experimental design. We design a two-stage auto-bidding algorithm based on Lagrange duality that dynamically paces budget through a shadow price and optimizes impression-level bids using per-impression marginal utilities. To address missing labels at bid time, we propose a confidence-gated gradient heuristic, paired with a zeroth-order variant for black-box models that reliably estimates learning signals in real time. We provide theoretical guarantees, proving monotone submodularity of the composite objective, sublinear regret in online auction, and budget feasibility. Extensive offline experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the framework: it outperforms baselines, achieves superior final AUC/LogLoss, adheres closely to budget targets, and remains effective when gradients are approximated zeroth-order. These results show that strategic, information-aware promotion can improve long-term model performance and organic outcomes beyond naive impression-maximization strategies.

*Dimitris Michailidis,Sennay Ghebreab,Fernando P. Santos*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper examines the disparities in benefits from transport network expansions, focusing on how differences in commuter adaptation rates lead to inequality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the unequal adaptation of commuters to expanded transport networks creates disparities, and to address the inefficiency and equity implications of such large-scale interventions.

Method: The authors use reinforcement learning models to simulate commuter behavior, introducing the 'Price of Learning' (PoL) concept to assess inefficiency during adaptation, and analyze scenarios in simplified and real-world-inspired transport networks.

Result: Simulations revealed that transport network expansions can enhance overall efficiency but also amplify inequality, as faster-learning commuters gain disproportionate benefits initially.

Conclusion: Transport policies must consider the heterogeneous adaptation behaviors of commuters during equilibrium shifts to balance network efficiency and fairness.

Abstract: Who benefits from expanding transport networks? While designed to improve mobility, such interventions can also create inequality. In this paper, we show that disparities arise not only from the structure of the network itself but also from differences in how commuters adapt to it. We model commuters as reinforcement learning agents who adapt their travel choices at different learning rates, reflecting unequal access to resources and information. To capture potential efficiency-fairness tradeoffs, we introduce the Price of Learning (PoL), a measure of inefficiency during learning. We analyze both a stylized network -- inspired in the well-known Braess's paradox, yet with two-source nodes -- and an abstraction of a real-world metro system (Amsterdam). Our simulations show that network expansions can simultaneously increase efficiency and amplify inequality, especially when faster learners disproportionately benefit from new routes before others adapt. These results highlight that transport policies must account not only for equilibrium outcomes but also for the heterogeneous ways commuters adapt, since both shape the balance between efficiency and fairness.

### [415] [Independence of Approximate Clones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20779)
*Théo Delemazure*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper investigates the concept of approximate clones in ordinal elections, proposing measures for proximity to perfect clones and studying their influence on voting rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the study of the independence of clones axiom by exploring realistic voting situations where two candidates might be approximate clones rather than perfect clones, especially since perfect clones rarely occur in practical elections.

Method: The paper defines two measures for approximate clones and analyzes voting rules for their independence of approximate clones. Furthermore, an empirical analysis was conducted using three real-world datasets: Scottish local elections, mini-jury deliberations, and figure skating judge votes.

Result: It was found that voting rules satisfying the independence of clones axiom in the case of perfect clones do not maintain this property for approximate clones unless there are only three candidates. Empirical results showed approximate clones exist in some voting contexts and their removal's effect on outcomes diminishes as their similarity increases.

Conclusion: While voting rules independent of perfect clones cannot guarantee independence concerning approximate clones with four or more candidates, they perform reasonably well in more constrained scenarios. Approximate clones are contextually common, and their closeness affects outcome stability for certain voting rules.

Abstract: In an ordinal election, two candidates are said to be perfect clones if every voter ranks them adjacently. The independence of clones axiom then states that removing one of the two clones should not change the election outcome. This axiom has been extensively studied in social choice theory, and several voting rules are known to satisfy it (such as IRV, Ranked Pairs and Schulze). However, perfect clones are unlikely to occur in practice, especially for political elections with many voters.
  In this work, we study different notions of approximate clones in ordinal elections. Informally, two candidates are approximate clones in a preference profile if they are close to being perfect clones. We discuss two measures to quantify this proximity, and we show under which conditions the voting rules that are known to be independent of clones are also independent of approximate clones. In particular, we show that for elections with at least four candidates, none of these rules are independent of approximate clones in the general case. However, we find a more positive result for the case of three candidates. Finally, we conduct an empirical study of approximate clones and independence of approximate clones based on three real-world datasets: votes in local Scottish elections, votes in mini-jury deliberations, and votes of judges in figure skating competitions. We find that approximate clones are common in some contexts, and that the closest two candidates are to being perfect clones, the less likely their removal is to change the election outcome, especially for voting rules that are independent of perfect clones.

*Paolo Baldan,Roberto Bruni,Francesco Ranzato,Diletta Rigo*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces APPL, a comprehensive Hoare-style logic framework for abstract program properties, merging traditional, incorrectness, and hyperproperty logics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify various program logics and establish a general logic capable of handling broad abstractions in program analysis.

Method: Developed APPL using lattice-based semantics with additivity and a monoidal operator for nondeterministic choice, enabling flexibility across different abstract domains.

Result: APPL is sound, relatively complete, and supports modular framework applications in abstract deduction systems when meeting expressivity and completeness conditions.

Conclusion: APPL provides a powerful, principled semantic foundation for analyzing and reasoning across diverse program and abstract properties efficiently.

Abstract: We introduce APPL (Abstract Program Property Logic), a unifying Hoare-style logic that subsumes standard Hoare logic, incorrectness logic, and several variants of Hyper Hoare logic. APPL provides a principled foundation for abstract program logics parameterised by an abstract domain, encompassing both existing and novel abstractions of properties and hyperproperties. The logic is grounded in a semantic framework where the meaning of commands is first defined on a lattice basis and then extended to the full lattice via additivity. Crucially, nondeterministic choice is interpreted by a monoidal operator that need not be idempotent nor coincide with the lattice join. This flexibility allows the framework to capture collecting semantics, various classes of abstract semantics, and hypersemantics. The APPL proof system is sound, and it is relatively complete whenever the property language is sufficiently expressive. When the property language is restricted to an abstract domain, the result is a sound abstract deduction system based on best correct approximations. Relative completeness with respect to a corresponding abstract semantics is recovered provided the abstract domain is complete, in the sense of abstract interpretation, for the monoidal operator.

*Nikolaj Käfer,Ahmed Khalil,Edward Huynh,Efstathios Bakolas,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces IBR-GCS, a planning framework for multi-vehicle autonomous driving that integrates game-theoretic interaction, maneuver reasoning, and trajectory planning using a Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of strategic interaction and hybrid maneuver planning for autonomous vehicles under shared safety constraints.

Method: IBR-GCS is an iterative best-response framework that combines vehicle-specific, strategy-dependent GCS constructions. It simplifies trajectory planning as a shortest-path optimization problem using convex relaxation methods.

Result: The approach produces safe, strategically consistent trajectories and demonstrates effective performance in multi-lane, multi-vehicle scenarios through simulations.

Conclusion: IBR-GCS effectively provides a unified and scalable solution for modeling and planning multi-vehicle autonomous interactions that adhere to safety and strategic consistency.

Abstract: Multi-vehicle autonomous driving couples strategic interaction with hybrid (discrete-continuous) maneuver planning under shared safety constraints. We introduce IBR-GCS, an Iterative Best Response (IBR) planning approach based on the Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) framework that models highway driving as a generalized noncooperative game. IBR-GCS integrates combinatorial maneuver reasoning, trajectory planning, and game-theoretic interaction within a unified framework. The key novelty is a vehicle-specific, strategy-dependent GCS construction. Specifically, at each best-response update, each vehicle builds its own graph conditioned on the current strategies of the other vehicles, with vertices representing lane-specific, time-varying, convex, collision-free regions and edges encoding dynamically feasible transitions. This yields a shortest-path problem in GCS for each best-response step, which admits an efficient convex relaxation that can be solved using convex optimization tools without exhaustive discrete tree search. We then apply an iterative best-response scheme in which vehicles update their trajectories sequentially and provide conditions under which the resulting inexact updates converge to an approximate generalized Nash equilibrium. Simulation results across multi-lane, multi-vehicle scenarios demonstrate that IBR-GCS produces safe trajectories and strategically consistent interactive behaviors.

*Ling Tang,Jilin Mei,Dongrui Liu,Chen Qian,Dawei Cheng,Jing Shao,Xia Hu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to explain emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, focusing on attribution and risk quantification using Shapley value adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the interpretability and safety of multi-agent systems by explaining the origins and drivers of emergent extreme events within these complex structures.

Method: The authors use the Shapley value method to attribute extreme events to specific agent actions over time, aggregating attribution scores by time, agent, and behavior dimensions to assess risk contributions.

Result: Experiments conducted in diverse multi-agent scenarios (economic, financial, and social systems) validate the framework's ability to effectively explain emergent extreme events.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables analysis of extreme events in multi-agent systems, offering tools to evaluate risks and gain insights into the underlying dynamics of such systems.

Abstract: Large language model-powered multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex human-like systems. The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cache-aware hybrid sieve improving the classical Sieve of Eratosthenes with segmentation, bit-packing, and cache-focused optimizations for better memory efficiency and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory access inefficiencies in the classical Sieve of Eratosthenes, particularly its practical limitations on modern CPUs.

Method: Development of a cache-aware hybrid sieve using segmentation, bit-packing, and cache-line-aligned block processing. It reduces memory usage by storing odd numbers only and minimizes cache misses with cache-sized blocks.

Result: The hybrid sieve achieves up to eight times memory reduction and runtime improvements of up to 2.4x versus the classical sieve, and 1.7x against the segmented sieve across benchmarks up to 10^9.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that architecture-aware algorithm designs significantly enhance practical performance in prime generation tasks across modern systems.

Abstract: Prime generation is a fundamental task in cryptography, number theory, and randomized algorithms. While the classical Sieve of Eratosthenes is simple and efficient in theory, its practical performance on modern central processing units is often limited by memory access inefficiencies. This paper introduces a cache-aware hybrid sieve that integrates segmentation, bit-packing, and cache-line-aligned block processing to optimize memory bandwidth and level one and level two cache locality.
  The proposed approach reduces memory usage by storing only odd numbers and using one bit per value. The sieve range is divided into cache-sized blocks to minimize cache misses, while primes up to the square root of the limit are reused across blocks. Experimental results demonstrate up to an eight times reduction in memory usage and runtime improvements of up to two point four times compared to the classical sieve and one point seven times compared to the segmented sieve. Benchmarks up to ten to the power of nine illustrate that architecture-aware algorithm design can yield substantial practical performance gains.

*Suyash Deshmukh,Chayan Chatterjee,Abigail Petulante,Tabata Aira Ferreira,Karan Jani*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method using pre-trained audio models for glitch classification in gravitational-wave data, addressing issues related to large labeled datasets and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current glitch classification methods for gravitational wave detectors require extensive labeled datasets and struggle to adapt to new signal types, limiting their efficiency.

Method: The authors employ the Audio Spectrogram Transformer, a model pre-trained on audio data, and adapt its features to classify glitches and signals in gravitational-wave strain data.

Result: The approach demonstrated superior feature extraction and validated its effectiveness using unsupervised clustering techniques on LIGO strain data from O3 and O4 observing runs. Resultant embeddings aligned with existing glitch classes.

Conclusion: This method provides a robust, efficient framework for glitch classification and detecting anomalies, leveraging pre-trained audio models in gravitational-wave signal analysis.

Abstract: Transient noise artifacts, or glitches, fundamentally limit the sensitivity of gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers and can mimic true astrophysical signals, particularly the short-duration intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers. Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck," requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors.
