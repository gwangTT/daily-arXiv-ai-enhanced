### [1] [BrowserArena: Evaluating LLM Agents on Real-World Web Navigation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02418)
*Sagnik Anupam,Davis Brown,Shuo Li,Eric Wong,Hamed Hassani,Osbert Bastani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "BrowserArena," a platform for evaluating web agents' performance on real-world tasks, identifying consistent failure modes, and studying how models handle these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents perform tasks on the open web, yet existing evaluations are limited to constrained environments, lacking real-world application insights.

Method: The authors developed BrowserArena, a platform collecting user-submitted tasks to conduct head-to-head agent comparisons with human feedback on specific actions, and analyzed failure modes with targeted datasets.

Result: Three main failure modes were identified: captcha resolution, pop-up banner handling, and navigating to URLs. Models showed diverse but brittle behaviors when addressing these challenges.

Conclusion: The research highlights current web agents' limitations and variability, demonstrating BrowserArena's utility in understanding failure modes and advancing web agent evaluation.

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

### [2] [RefineShot: Rethinking Cinematography Understanding with Foundational Skill Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02423)
*Hang Wu,Yujun Cai,Haonan Ge,Hongkai Chen,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RefineShot, a refined benchmark for assessing cinematography understanding by resolving issues in prior benchmarks like ShotBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of the initial ShotBench benchmark and ShotVL model in evaluating cinematography understanding, enabling fairer evaluations and fostering advancements.

Method: The authors refine ShotBench for consistency, analyze ShotVL's reasoning, and propose an expanded evaluation protocol assessing both task accuracy and core competencies.

Result: Development of RefineShot, a benchmark that resolves ambiguities, improves evaluation reliability, and establishes new assessment protocols for cinematography understanding.

Conclusion: RefineShot significantly enhances the reliability of cinematography benchmarks, promoting innovation in multimodal understanding and coherent content creation.

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

### [3] [Safe and Efficient In-Context Learning via Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02480)
*Andrea Wynn,Metod Jazbec,Charith Peris,Rinat Khaziev,Anqi Liu,Daniel Khashabi,Eric Nalisnick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for safeguarding large language models against malicious in-context examples while enhancing their computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' flexibility to learn from few examples poses safety risks, as harmful demonstrations can degrade performance and manipulate outputs.

Method: The method defines zero-shot performance as a safety baseline, uses distribution-free risk control, and employs dynamic early exit prediction to minimize the influence of harmful examples.

Result: The approach successfully mitigates the effect of harmful inputs while improving computational efficiency with helpful demonstrations, backed by both theoretical and empirical validations.

Conclusion: The proposed safeguards for LLMs improve resilience against unsafe inputs and show promise for efficient and secure deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

### [4] [Multimodal Function Vectors for Spatial Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02528)
*Shuhao Fu,Esther Goldberg,Ying Nian Wu,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how a small subset of attention heads in large vision-language models contribute to relational reasoning, proposing a method to extract and manipulate these mechanisms to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to better understand the opaque internal mechanisms of large multimodal models (LMMs) and improve their relational reasoning abilities motivates this study.

Method: The authors use causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads responsible for transmitting spatial relations in OpenFlamingo-4B. They extract and manipulate 'function vectors' from these heads and demonstrate their utility in improving zero-shot accuracy, fine-tuning, and solving novel analogy tasks.

Result: Key attention heads encoding spatial relationships in LMMs were identified. Function vectors extracted from these heads improve model performance on relational tasks and demonstrate strong generalization when combined linearly.

Conclusion: LMMs localize spatial relational reasoning in specific attention heads, which can be isolated, optimized, and controlled to improve model modularity and relational reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

### [5] [Orchestrating Human-AI Teams: The Manager Agent as a Unifying Research Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02557)
*Charlie Masters,Advaith Vellanki,Jiangbo Shangguan,Bart Kultys,Jonathan Gilmore,Alastair Moore,Stefano V. Albrecht*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on the challenge of managing complex workflows in dynamic human-AI teams and introduces the concept of an Autonomous Manager Agent. Key challenges and a new simulation framework called MA-Gym are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of orchestrating complex workflows involving dynamic collaboration between human and AI agents.

Method: The authors formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game, identify four core challenges, and evaluate their approach using MA-Gym, a simulation framework.

Result: Evaluation of GPT-5-based Manager Agents highlights the difficulty in optimizing goal completion, constraint adherence, and workflow runtime.

Conclusion: Workflow management in human-AI systems remains a challenging open problem, with implications for organization and ethics.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

*Peter Pak,Achuth Chandrasekhar,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent system using Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled agents to streamline and automate alloy discovery in additive manufacturing by leveraging autonomous decision-making and tool integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of alloy discovery in additive manufacturing, which requires expertise across materials science, computational simulations, and experimental methods, necessitates a tool to simplify and accelerate the process.

Method: The authors developed a multi-agent system employing LLM-enabled agents integrated with Model Context Protocol (MCP). These agents utilize tools for tasks like property diagram calculations and process map generation, while dynamically adapting task executions based on outcomes.

Result: The system effectively reasons through complex prompts, performs relevant analyses, adjusts its actions autonomously, and demonstrates its utility for automating alloy discovery in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: The multi-agent system showcases the value of LLM-enabled automation for alloy discovery, highlighting its potential in additive manufacturing to enhance efficiency and decision-making.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

*Yunqi Huang,Nishith Chennakeshava,Alexis Carras,Vladislav Neverov,Wei Liu,Aske Plaat,Yingjie Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks five RL algorithms for container stowage planning and crane scheduling, introducing a reusable Gym environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Container stowage planning affects supply chain efficiency and currently relies heavily on human expertise. The goal is to analyze and improve RL methods for this complex problem.

Method: The authors develop a Gym environment to simulate CSPP and crane scheduling while testing five RL algorithms (DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, TRPO) under scenarios of varying complexity.

Result: The study finds varying performance among RL algorithms as problem complexity increases, emphasizing the role of methodological and formulation choices.

Conclusion: The paper provides a benchmark for RL in CSPP and a tool for future research, supporting advancements in maritime logistics.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to process multimodal sensor data and generate natural language alerts, improving safety in electric vehicle (EV) integration into smart grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical challenge of ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers, vehicles, and their environments while enhancing both transportation systems and energy networks.

Method: The method involves combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded positioning, and CAN bus telemetry to create a multi-modal framework that processes sensor data and generates natural-language alerts.

Result: The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through real-world data and case studies, showing its ability to generate context-aware alerts for critical urban driving scenarios, such as pedestrian and cyclist proximity.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLM-based frameworks can act as assistive tools in e-mobility, enabling safer urban driving, scalable fleet coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

### [9] [Mitigating Modal Imbalance in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02608)
*Chen Henry Wu,Neil Kale,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of foundation models (FMs) to perform joint reasoning across multiple modalities, especially in scenarios with conflicting evidence. It finds that FMs struggle with cross-modal reasoning due to attention imbalances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to analyze how well foundation models integrate diverse modalities for joint reasoning, particularly in real-world use cases where modalities may conflict.

Method: The authors examine FMs' capability to handle cross-modal conflicts by presenting evidence from various modalities and analyzing attention scores. They further propose a scalable method to reduce attention imbalance through explicit multimodal training examples.

Result: The study reveals that FMs can detect conflicts in unimodal contexts at a high rate but perform poorly in cross-modal contexts, with attention imbalance disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities.

Conclusion: Explicitly combining multiple modalities within training instances improves attention balance and enhances downstream performance. The work highlights the need for systematically addressing cross-modal reasoning challenges to enhance the reliability of foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

### [10] [On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611)
*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores test-time scaling (TTS) in reasoning for large language models. It identifies limitations in increasing sample numbers and introduces temperature scaling as a novel strategy to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance performance in large language models (LLMs) during reasoning tasks and address limitations in current test-time scaling methods, particularly when solving hard reasoning questions.

Method: The authors propose temperature scaling, which involves varying sampling temperatures to expand the reasoning capacity of LLMs. They evaluate the method using benchmarks and develop a multi-temperature voting mechanism to optimize the process.

Result: Temperature scaling achieves a 7.3-point performance gain over single-temperature TTS and allows base models to match reinforcement learning-trained ones without additional training. This validates the approach's efficacy across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Temperature scaling unlocks latent capabilities in large language models and proves to be a powerful yet simple enhancement to test-time scaling methods, improving reasoning and reducing the need for extensive post-training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

about geology theses from the Central University of Ecuador. Our proposal uses
the Llama 3.1 and Gemini 2.5 language models, which are complemented by a

responses generated. The system offers an intuitive, web-based interface that
facilitates interaction and information retrieval for directors, teachers,
students, and administrative staff at the institution. This tool can be a key
support in education, training, and research and establishes a basis for future
applications in other disciplines.

### [12] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new real-world event-centric concept of 'possibility' based on prerequisites and constraints, distinct from Zadeh's 1978 version.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative and practical notion of 'possibility' for real-world event feasibility, enhancing planning and reasoning.

Method: The concept of possibility is formally defined using prerequisites, constraints, and their probabilities, with theory elaborated via vehicle route planning example.

Result: The proposed concept identifies the most feasible plan among several options, aligning with human reasoning in planning contexts.

Conclusion: This new version of possibility effectively applies to planning problems and opens opportunities for future applications.

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoMaAS, an automated multi-agent architecture search framework that optimizes agent configurations using techniques inspired by neural architecture search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models face challenges in adapting resource allocation based on varying query complexities and domain needs, as current automated designs seek inflexible monolithic solutions.

Method: AutoMaAS employs dynamic operator lifecycle management and automated machine learning to optimize agent architectures. It features automatic operator generation, cost-aware parameter adjustment, online feedback integration, and decision tracing for interpretability.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate a 1.0-7.1% performance improvement and a 3-5% reduction in inference costs compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework shows robust transferability across datasets and large language model backbones.

Conclusion: AutoMaAS establishes a new paradigm for creating adaptive, resource-efficient, and interpretable multi-agent systems in the context of large language models.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent for systematically assessing safety risks in vision-language models (VLMs). ARMs achieves state-of-the-art results by generating diverse adversarial attacks, revealing vulnerabilities, and providing a safety dataset for fine-tuning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As vision-language models (VLMs) grow in prominence, they present new safety vulnerabilities that are difficult to evaluate systematically. Current red-teaming efforts lack scalability and adaptability, necessitating a more comprehensive approach to uncover emerging risks.

Method: The authors propose ARMs, an agent that automates red-teaming by optimizing multimodal attack strategies through reasoning-enhanced, multi-step orchestration. ARMs integrates 17 red-teaming algorithms and employs a layered memory with an epsilon-greedy exploration algorithm to balance attack diversity and effectiveness.

Result: ARMs achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates, averaging 52.1% higher than baselines and exceeding 90% in specific cases (e.g., Claude-4-Sonnet). It generates highly diverse red-teaming instances, unveils new vulnerabilities in VLMs, and creates ARMs-Bench, a safety dataset with over 30,000 instances spanning 51 risk categories.

Conclusion: ARMs provides a scalable, effective tool for assessing and mitigating safety risks in VLMs. Its integration of diverse attacks and creation of a large-scale safety dataset enable researchers to improve multimodal safety alignment and robustness against emerging threats.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

### [15] [Automated Constraint Specification for Job Scheduling by Regulating Generative Model with Domain-Specific Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02679)
*Yu-Zhe Shi,Qiao Xu,Yanjia Li,Mingchen Liu,Huamin Qu,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constraint-centric architecture leveraging LLMs to automate constraint specification in production scheduling while addressing issues like ambiguity and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual specification of manufacturing constraints is labor-intensive, and there is a need to harness LLMs to automate this process despite the challenges they face in industrial applications.

Method: The authors present a hierarchical constraint-centric architecture using domain-specific representations to regulate LLM outputs, coupled with an automated production scenario adaptation algorithm for customization.

Result: Experimental results show that the approach surpasses pure LLM-based methods in reliability and effectiveness for constraint specification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture balances LLM generative strengths with manufacturing reliability needs, demonstrating its value in enhancing APS systems.

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

*Yulong Zhang,Li Wang,Wei Du,Peilin Li,Yuqin Dai Zhiyuan Zhao,Lingyong Fang,Ziniu Liu,Ru Zhang,Huijia Zhu,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV), a lightweight framework for verifying reasoning in language models by breaking down reasoning into binary consistency checks, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is challenging due to issues with error localization and high token costs in existing methods.

Method: The authors propose NCV, a training-free approach that decomposes reasoning chains into interconnected verification nodes for precise binary consistency checks and efficient error localization.

Result: Experiments show that NCV improves interpretability and scalability, achieving 10% to 25% higher F1 scores on public datasets while reducing token usage by factors of 6x to 58x compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: NCV offers an efficient, scalable solution for verifying reasoning in language models, addressing key limitations of existing methods and enhancing performance.

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

*Wonjoong Kim,Sangwu Park,Yeonjun In,Sein Kim,Dongha Lee,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents TRACE, a framework for evaluating tool-augmented LLM agent performance across multiple dimensions, beyond just final answers, addressing efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most evaluations of tool-augmented benchmarks focus solely on answer matching, which is inadequate for complex tasks requiring detailed trajectory evaluation.

Method: TRACE utilizes an evidence bank to track reasoning steps and provides a multi-dimensional evaluation. A meta-evaluation dataset is developed with diverse flawed trajectories and performance score labels for validation.

Result: TRACE demonstrates accurate, scalable, and cost-effective evaluations of reasoning trajectories, even with small open-source LLMs, while offering new behavioral insights.

Conclusion: TRACE provides a robust and detailed framework for assessing tool-augmented LLM agents, enabling better understanding and refinement of their problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

### [18] [Take Goodhart Seriously: Principled Limit on General-Purpose AI Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02840)
*Antoine Maier,Aude Maier,Tom David*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Machine learning models often fail to fully satisfy their specified objectives because of various errors and inevitable objective misspecification, leading to risks of control loss when optimization pressure is unchecked.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scrutinize the assumption that machine learning models perfectly satisfy their specified objectives and the overlooked implications of deviations from this assumption.

Method: A theoretical framework is employed to analyze the systematic deviations due to approximation, estimation, optimization errors, and inevitable misspecification of objectives.

Result: Approximating and fully specifying developer intent in formal objectives is shown to be impractical, and the study reveals that unchecked optimization may lead systems into irreversible failures linked to Goodhart's law.

Conclusion: A principled limit on optimization for General-Purpose AI systems is proposed to prevent predictable failures and ensure control maintenance.

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

### [19] [Reward Model Routing in Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02850)
*Xinle Wu,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces BayesianRouter, a hybrid approach to improve reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) for large language models. It dynamically selects reward models (RMs) while overcoming cold-start and exploration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most RLHF/RLAIF pipelines rely on a single reward model, which limits alignment quality and risks overfitting. Existing RM routing methods fail to address challenges like cold-start and insufficient exploration.

Method: BayesianRouter combines offline RM strength estimation using a multi-task router and online Bayesian Thompson sampling for dynamic RM selection. It adaptively updates RM-specific weight vectors with priors and posterior adjustments.

Result: BayesianRouter demonstrates superior performance in instruction-following and reasoning benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, GSM8K, MMLU) compared to individual reward models, ensembles, and existing routing methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging both offline reliability learning and online adaptive selection, BayesianRouter enhances RLHF/RLAIF pipelines, offering a robust and efficient solution for reward model routing to improve language model alignment quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

*Tianren Ma,Mu Zhang,Yibing Wang,Qixiang Ye*

TL;DR: MaskGRPO introduces scalable multimodal reinforcement learning to discrete diffusion models, with improved importance sampling and modality-specific adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance discrete diffusion models with scalable reinforcement learning methods for multimodal tasks while addressing the limitations in importance sampling and rollout complexity.

Method: Developed MaskGRPO, employing a clarified theoretical foundation for importance estimators and tailored rollout methods for optimizing discrete diffusion models.

Result: MaskGRPO achieved stable updates, stronger reasoning performance, and better generation quality across benchmarks like math reasoning, coding, and visual generation.

Conclusion: MaskGRPO is established as the first practical method for discretized visual diffusion and a systematic approach to multimodal policy optimization.

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

TL;DR: This paper explores the fundamental philosophical issues in explainable AI (XAI) methods, emphasizing the importance of ontological and epistemological assumptions in designing and selecting such methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current explainable AI (XAI) methods, which often rely on implicit and potentially flawed assumptions about the nature and knowability of explanations. This leads to challenges in trustworthiness and domain-specific application.

Method: The authors conduct a philosophical and technical analysis, exploring the ontological and epistemological assumptions inherent in various XAI methods. They examine how these assumptions affect the methods' applicability and explanatory utility.

Result: The study identifies significant impacts of technical changes to XAI methods on the underlying philosophical assumptions. Additionally, it highlights the consequences of neglecting onto-epistemological paradigms in selecting XAI methods for different domains.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the need for careful consideration of ontological and epistemological assumptions when developing or applying XAI methods. They advocate for selecting and adapting these methods based on the specific requirements of different application domains.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

*Anna Trapp,Mersedeh Sadeghi,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces counterfactual explanations for rule-based smart environments, comparing their utility to causal explanations through a user study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for actionable and user-friendly explanations in rule-based smart environments, addressing an unexplored area of generating counterfactuals in such domains.

Method: Developed a plugin to extend an existing explanation engine to generate counterfactual and causal explanations, followed by conducting a user study with 17 participants to evaluate their preference.

Result: Users preferred causal explanations for simplicity in time-sensitive situations, while counterfactuals were favored for their actionable insights in problem resolution scenarios.

Conclusion: Counterfactual explanations suit specific contexts better and complement traditional causal approaches, forming a practical framework for enhanced explainability in smart environments.

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ability of AI systems to generalize abstract reasoning by analyzing their performance on the I-RAVEN dataset when challenged with omitted structural rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding whether modern AI systems genuinely reason or simply rely on statistical shortcuts when handling RPM tasks.

Method: Two types of models, sequence-to-sequence transformers and vision-based architectures like CoPINet and Dual-Contrast Network, were trained on incomplete structural rule sets and assessed on the I-RAVEN dataset.

Result: Transformers performed well on familiar rules but struggled with novel or omitted ones, revealing a sharp decline in accuracy and exposing token-level vs. overall answer accuracy limitations.

Conclusion: The results highlight critical limitations in current AI models for abstract reasoning and call for innovative architectures that advance beyond pattern recognition.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in manually crafting visualizations and the limitations of current systems in handling complex datasets, multiple files, and iterative refinement.

Method: A collaborative multi-agent system (CoDA) was introduced, leveraging LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation, and self-reflection. The process formalizes metadata analysis to handle token limits and emphasizes quality-driven refinement.

Result: CoDA showed significant improvements, outperforming current baselines by up to 41.5% in overall performance scores.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of using collaborative multi-agent systems over isolated solutions for advancing visualization automation, emphasizing integrated workflows as the future direction.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

*Cai Zhou,Chenxiao Yang,Yi Hu,Chenyu Wang,Chubin Zhang,Muhan Zhang,Lester Mackey,Tommi Jaakkola,Stephen Bates,Dinghuai Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion" (CCDD), a model that improves the expressivity and performance of continuous diffusion language models by jointly operating in both continuous and discrete spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous diffusion models struggle in comparison with discrete models due to difficulties decoding between continuous and discrete token spaces, despite their theoretical advantages in expressivity.

Method: The proposed CCDD model uses a joint multimodal diffusion process in continuous and discrete spaces, combining the strengths of both while employing advanced architectures and training/sampling techniques.

Result: CCDD achieved strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments, showing better trainability and sample quality.

Conclusion: The model resolves the trainability limitations of continuous diffusion while preserving its expressivity, offering a promising step forward in diffusion-based language modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

### [27] [HALO: Memory-Centric Heterogeneous Accelerator with 2.5D Integration for Low-Batch LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02675)
*Shubham Negi,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: HALO is a new hardware accelerator designed for efficient inference in low-batch and long-context Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for high-efficiency in LLM inference, especially for latency-sensitive applications like chatbots, requires tailored solutions for prefill and decode phases with diverse computational and memory needs.

Method: HALO leverages a heterogeneous accelerator design combining HBM-based Compute-in-DRAM (CiD) and on-chip analog Compute-in-Memory (CiM) co-packaged using 2.5D integration. A phase-aware mapping strategy maximizes hardware utilization for prefill and decode operations.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen3 8B models demonstrated up to 18x speedup over AttAcc and 2.5x over CENT, showcasing the effectiveness of the HALO accelerator for LLM inference.

Conclusion: HALO's heterogeneous design addressing the distinct requirements of LLM inference outperforms other approaches, offering a promising solution for latency-sensitive and interactive applications.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven a growing
demand for efficient inference, particularly in latency-sensitive applications
such as chatbots and personalized assistants. Unlike traditional deep neural
networks, LLM inference proceeds in two distinct phases: the prefill phase,
which processes the full input sequence in parallel, and the decode phase,
which generates tokens sequentially. These phases exhibit highly diverse
compute and memory requirements, which makes accelerator design particularly
challenging. Prior works have primarily been optimized for high-batch inference
or evaluated only short input context lengths, leaving the low-batch and long
context regime, which is critical for interactive applications, largely
underexplored.
  We propose HALO, a heterogeneous memory centric accelerator designed for
these unique challenges of prefill and decode phases in low-batch LLM
inference. HALO integrates HBM based Compute-in-DRAM (CiD) with an on-chip
analog Compute-in-Memory (CiM), co-packaged using 2.5D integration. To further
improve the hardware utilization, we introduce a phase-aware mapping strategy
that adapts to the distinct demands of the prefill and decode phases. Compute
bound operations in the prefill phase are mapped to CiM to exploit its high
throughput matrix multiplication capability, while memory-bound operations in
the decode phase are executed on CiD to benefit from reduced data movement
within DRAM. Additionally, we present an analysis of the performance tradeoffs
of LLMs under two architectural extremes: a fully CiD and a fully on-chip
analog CiM design to highlight the need for a heterogeneous design. We evaluate
HALO on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen3 8B models. Our experimental results show that LLMs
mapped to HALO achieve up to 18x geometric mean speedup over AttAcc, an
attention-optimized mapping and 2.5x over CENT, a fully CiD based mapping.

Abstract: The combinatorial problem Max-Cut has become a benchmark in the evaluation of
local search heuristics for both quantum and classical optimisers. In contrast
to local search, which only provides average-case performance guarantees, the
convex semidefinite relaxation of Max-Cut by Goemans and Williamson, provides
worst-case guarantees and is therefore suited to both the construction of
benchmarks and in applications to performance-critic scenarios.
  We show how extended floating point precision can be incorporated in
algebraic subroutines in convex optimisation, namely in indirect matrix
inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which are used in Interior Point
Methods in the case of very large problem sizes. Also, an estimate is provided
of the expected acceleration of the time to solution for a hardware
architecture that runs natively on extended precision. Specifically, when using
indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which have lower
complexity than direct methods and are therefore used in very large problems,
we see that increasing the internal working precision reduces the time to
solution by a factor that increases with the system size.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet the growing demand for real-time, low-latency AI applications by leveraging FPGA advantages over GPUs for CNN implementations.

Method: Development of parameterizable and resource-efficient convolution IPs in VHDL using fixed-point arithmetic. Four IP variants are tailored for specific resource constraints.

Result: Experimental evaluation on a Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA demonstrates the IPs' trade-offs between performance and resource usage, and versatility across architectures.

Abstract: The increasing demand for real-time, low-latency artificial intelligence
applications has propelled the use of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementations. FPGAs offer
reconfigurability, energy efficiency, and performance advantages over GPUs,
making them suitable for edge devices and embedded systems. This work presents
a novel library of resource-efficient convolution IPs designed to automatically
adapt to the available FPGA resources. Developed in VHDL, these IPs are
parameterizable and utilize fixed-point arithmetic for optimal performance.
Four IPs are introduced, each tailored to specific resource constraints,
offering flexibility in DSP usage, logic consumption, and precision.
Experimental results on a Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA highlight the trade-offs
between performance and resource usage. The comparison with recent FPGA-based
CNN acceleration techniques emphasizes the versatility and independence of this
approach from specific FPGA architectures or technological advancements. Future
work will expand the library to include pooling and activation functions,
enabling broader applicability and integration into CNN frameworks.

### [30] [Breaking the MoE LLM Trilemma: Dynamic Expert Clustering with Structured Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02345)
*Peijun Zhu,Ning Yang,Jiayu Wei,Jinghang Wu,Haijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses key inefficiencies in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by introducing a unified framework combining dynamic expert clustering and structured compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the trilemma in MoE LLMs: load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead, which hinder their efficiency and scalability.

Method: The authors propose a method based on online clustering of experts using parameter and activation similarity, reducing parameters through low-rank adapters, introducing hierarchical routing, and applying mixed-precision storage and dynamic cluster offloading to enhance memory usage.

Result: The framework achieves approximately 80% parameter reduction, improves throughput by 10%-20%, significantly decreases expert load variance, and matches the quality of standard MoE models on benchmarks like GLUE and WikiText-103.

Conclusion: The proposed structural reorganization effectively scales and improves the efficiency, memory usage, and throughput of MoE LLMs without quality trade-offs, offering a promising pathway for large-scale language models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

### [31] [Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324)
*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL introduces an efficient algorithm for reducing hallucinations in LLMs by baking interpretable activation steering directly into a model's weights, achieving significant improvements in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit hallucinations, providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance, and existing solutions require real-time intervention. CASAL aims to address this limitation efficiently.

Method: CASAL employs an interpretability-inspired approach to optimize models by embedding activation steering effects directly into model weights, training only a submodule of a single transformer layer efficiently.

Result: CASAL reduces hallucinations by 30%-40% across short-form QA benchmarks while being 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than LoRA-based baselines. It generalizes well to out-of-distribution domains and works for various model types.

Conclusion: CASAL presents an impactful and efficient solution for practical deployment in production systems, effectively addressing hallucination in both text-only and vision-language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

*Vivek Bhavsar,Joseph Ereifej,Aravanan Gurusami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RA-FSM (Research Assistant - Finite State Machine) is a modular GPT-based research assistant designed to ensure accuracy and reliability by wrapping generative AI capabilities within a structured finite-state control loop and grounding outputs in verifiable academic sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of large language models in tasks requiring accurate, well-cited information for high-stakes, expert workflows while mitigating issues like hallucinations and mis-citations.

Method: Develop a GPT-based assistant that includes a finite-state control loop for modular operation with states including Relevance, Confidence, and Knowledge. The system incorporates vector retrieval, deterministic citation, and a ranked-tier ingestion workflow to ensure robust data handling and citation accuracy.

Result: The RA-FSM system, implemented in the photonics domain, outperforms standard GPT-based approaches in six key tasks as assessed by domain experts. Its advantages include better handling of boundary conditions and more defensible use of evidence.

Conclusion: RA-FSM enhances reliability and domain specificity in literature synthesis tasks, making it suitable for high-stakes technical work. Its modular and transparent framework is adaptable to other scientific fields.

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

### [33] [KAME: Tandem Architecture for Enhancing Knowledge in Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02327)
*So Kuroki,Yotaro Kubo,Takuya Akiba,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid architecture combining speech-to-speech (S2S) and a text-based large language model (LLM). It achieves low-latency responsiveness while enhancing knowledge representation, outperforming baseline S2S systems in correctness and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time S2S systems have low latency but lack deep knowledge, whereas cascaded systems offer better understanding at the cost of high latency.

Method: A hybrid framework processes speech through an S2S transformer for responsiveness and supplements it with real-time, knowledge-rich guidance from a back-end LLM.

Result: The hybrid system outperforms baseline S2S in response accuracy and achieves comparable latency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines the strengths of S2S and LLMs, delivering both responsiveness and improved semantic accuracy without significant latency.

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

*Ziqing Wang,Chengsheng Mao,Xiaole Wen,Yuan Luo,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMANDA, a training-free framework enhancing multimodal medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of existing Med-MLLMs in low-resource environments, particularly their limited medical reasoning due to intrinsic and extrinsic bottlenecks.

Method: AMANDA enhances medical reasoning by leveraging intrinsic knowledge through question decomposition and extrinsic knowledge through biomedical knowledge graph retrieval.

Result: AMANDA significantly improves zero-shot and few-shot performance on eight Med-VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The AMANDA framework effectively augments medical reasoning and accuracy in medical visual question answering without requiring extensive training.

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is
available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.

*Kanghoon Yoon,Minsub Kim,Sungjae Lee,Joonhyung Lee,Sunghyeon Woo,Yeonjun In,Se Jung Kwon,Chanyoung Park,Dongsoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SelfJudge method improves speculative decoding for large language models (LLMs), using self-supervised verification of tokens to enhance both inference speed and accuracy across various NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing judge decoding methods require human annotations or verifiable ground truths, which restrict their applicability to diverse NLP tasks.

Method: SelfJudge employs self-supervision by the target model to train verifiers that assess semantic preservation by evaluating token-substituted responses for their ability to maintain the original responses' meaning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SelfJudge outperforms baseline judge decoding methods, achieving better inference-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: SelfJudge provides a versatile and automated approach to accelerate LLM inference while maintaining semantic integrity, making it suitable for various NLP applications.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

### [36] [EntropyLong: Effective Long-Context Training via Predictive Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02330)
*Junlong Jia,Ziyang Chen,Xing Wu,Chaochen Gao,Zijia Lin,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu,Binghui Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EntropyLong, a data construction method for improving long-context language models by verifying long-range dependencies using predictive uncertainty and generating datasets with measurable information gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training long-context language models fail to reliably capture long-range dependencies, limiting their effectiveness in tasks requiring distant information.

Method: The proposed method identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves semantically relevant contexts, and verifies their utility by checking for reductions in prediction entropy, ensuring genuine information gain.

Result: The method produces datasets with verified long-range dependencies that lead to substantial improvements in benchmark tasks like RULER and LongBenchv2.

Conclusion: Entropy-based verification and the resulting dataset improve the ability of language models to process and utilize long-range dependencies effectively, demonstrating the necessity of this approach for long-context training.

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

*Moonkyung Ryu,Chih-Wei Hsu,Yinlam Chow,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh,Craig Boutilier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generating consistent conversational recommender system (CRS) data by using language models (LMs) paired with behavior simulators to create realistic user dialogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available CRS data makes fine-tuning LMs for CRSs difficult, requiring innovative approaches to simulate user behaviors for data generation.

Method: The paper combines behavior simulators with LM-prompting techniques to generate dialogues based on underlying user states, ensuring behavioral consistency, and facilitates data creation for CRSs.

Result: A large open-source CRS dataset was successfully generated, which features preference elicitation and example critiquing. Dialogue evaluation showed high consistency, factuality, and naturalness.

Conclusion: This methodology offers an effective solution for generating CRS data, leveraging LM capabilities and behavior simulators to address data scarcity while maintaining realistic user behavior.

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

*Yapei Feng,Feng Jiang,Shanhao Wu,Hua Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Look-ahead Sync to improve embedding capacity in neural linguistic steganography while maintaining security guarantees, outperforming SyncPool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the embedding capacity limitation and decoding failures caused by tokenization ambiguity in neural linguistic steganography.

Method: Look-ahead Sync performs minimal synchronized sampling on indistinguishable token sequences while preserving discernible paths for maximal embedding capacity.

Result: Experiments show Look-ahead Sync approaches theoretical capacity limits and improves embedding rate by over 160% in English and 25% in Chinese compared to SyncPool.

Conclusion: Look-ahead Sync advances high-capacity, secure neural linguistic steganography, setting new benchmarks for embedding efficiency and theoretical alignment.

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

Motivation: To provide semantically enriched mobility datasets that integrate contextual information for advanced analysis and FAIR data practices.

Method: Public OpenStreetMap GPS traces enriched with stops, moves, POIs, transport modes, weather data, synthetic social media from LLMs, and RDF for semantic compatibility.

Result: Developed datasets mapping Paris and New York with features supporting multimodal analysis, semantic mobility research, and dataset customization.

Conclusion: This resource is pioneering in combining real-world movements with structured semantic features, LLM-generated text, RDF compatibility, and reproducible pipelines for research use.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of
semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build
them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,
points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A
novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media
posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and
semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and
Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris
and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset
customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior
modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based
applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world
movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web
compatibility in a reusable framework.

*Zhe Li,Wei Zhao,Yige Li,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for diagnosing undesirable behaviors in LLMs using activation space analysis, enabling both sample-level and token-level attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit undesirable behaviors like harmful content and biases, and diagnosing their causes is crucial for ensuring AI safety. Existing methods fail at tackling this effectively due to noise and complexity.

Method: The method focuses on analyzing model's activation space and representation gradients to link model outputs to training data semantically.

Result: The approach excels at identifying harmful content, backdoor poisoning, and knowledge contamination, offering precise attribution at both sample and token levels.

Conclusion: This diagnostic framework enhances our understanding of LLM failures, promoting safer and more reliable deployment of these models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore LLMs' capabilities to assist mathematicians in complex proofs by addressing nontrivial proof obligations, a crucial aspect underexplored in formal theorem proving.

Method: The authors developed FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark extracted from formal proof sketches in foundational machine learning theories, combining premise retrieval and complex contexts to test LLMs on subgoal completion tasks.

Result: FormalML benchmark consists of 4937 problems varying in difficulty across optimization and probability inequalities. Evaluation shows state-of-the-art theorem provers reveal limitations in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need to improve LLM-based theorem proving systems to enhance practical usability and accuracy in subgoal completion tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first Kurdish STS dataset and benchmarks strong NLP models to address challenges in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the lack of resources for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks in low-resource languages like Kurdish.

Method: Authors created a 10,000-pair STS dataset annotated for similarity across formal and informal registers and benchmarked models such as Sentence-BERT and multilingual BERT.

Result: Competitive results were achieved with the evaluated models, revealing challenges in Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing.

Conclusion: This work establishes a reproducible evaluation setup and serves as groundwork to advance Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP.

Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of meaning overlap
between two texts and underpins many NLP tasks. While extensive resources exist
for high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish remain
underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset:
10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated
for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong
baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising
from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset
and baselines establish a reproducible evaluation suite and provide a strong
starting point for future research on Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP.

TL;DR: CRACQ is a multidimensional evaluation framework designed to assess documents based on Coherence, Rigor, Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for an interpretable and rubric-driven framework to evaluate machine-generated text beyond basic single-score approaches, especially as automated text generation grows more diverse.

Method: CRACQ uses a cumulative approach integrating linguistic, semantic, and structural signals to provide both holistic and trait-specific evaluations. The framework was trained using 500 synthetic grant proposals and benchmarked against LLM-based evaluations.

Result: CRACQ demonstrated more stable and interpretable trait-level judgments compared to direct LLM assessments, though challenges with reliability and domain scope were identified.

Conclusion: CRACQ offers a promising approach to multidimensional evaluation, addressing limitations of single-score methods, but requires further refinement to handle reliability and broader domain scope effectively.

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though

### [44] [Optimizing Long-Form Clinical Text Generation with Claim-Based Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02338)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Praphul Singh,Jangwon Kim,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning approach to improve the quality of long-form clinical text generation using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical documentation automation requires high accuracy in completeness and factual grounding, which poses challenges for long-form text generation.

Method: The authors propose Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) combined with DocLens, a deterministic reward framework that evaluates text at the claim level and optimizes directly for factual grounding and completeness.

Result: The method improves the factuality, completeness, and brevity of clinical notes, reduces hallucinations and omissions, and lowers training costs with a reward-gating strategy.

Conclusion: The framework enhances clinical documentation quality with scalable adaptability for real-world applications, including custom objectives like guideline adherence or billing requirements.

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

### [45] [Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification Methods in Argumentative Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02339)
*Kevin Zhou,Adam Dejl,Gabriel Freedman,Lihu Chen,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods in argumentative language models (ArgLLMs) and finds that direct prompting outperforms complex UQ approaches for claim verification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the reliability of large language models (LLMs), especially in decision-making tasks that incorporate computational argumentation, by evaluating and integrating uncertainty quantification methods.

Method: The paper integrates various UQ methods into argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs) and evaluates their performance on claim verification tasks. The experimental approach also examines the effectiveness of these UQ methods in handling intricate statements.

Result: Direct prompting, despite its inherent simplicity, significantly outperforms more complex UQ methodologies in the context of ArgLLMs.

Conclusion: Direct prompting is a highly effective UQ strategy for argumentative LLMs, which has implications for improving the reliability of LLMs in decision-making frameworks.

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

### [46] [Can Prompts Rewind Time for LLMs? Evaluating the Effectiveness of Prompted Knowledge Cutoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02340)
*Xin Gao,Ruiyi Zhang,Daniel Du,Saurabh Mahindre,Sai Ashish Somayajula,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers examined whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate earlier knowledge cutoffs via prompting techniques. They found LLMs are effective at forgetting direct information but struggle with causally related content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address contamination concerns in LLMs' predictions caused by memorization of pretraining data instead of genuine reasoning.

Method: The study introduced prompt-based unlearning techniques and evaluated them using three datasets focused on factual knowledge, semantic shifts, and causal relationships.

Result: LLMs effectively forgot direct factual knowledge post-cutoff but faced issues in forgetting causally related information.

Conclusion: Prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs can address direct information contamination but require more robust designs for handling indirect and causal queries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full
dataset and evaluation code are available at

### [47] [DRIFT: Learning from Abundant User Dissatisfaction in Real-World Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02341)
*Yifan Wang,Bolian Li,Junlin Wu,Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheli Liu,Ruqi Zhang,Ananth Grama,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRIFT, a novel training method leveraging user dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals for language model refinement, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of explicit user satisfaction feedback and effectively utilize abundant implicit dissatisfaction signals in real-world applications.

Method: DRIFT uses dissatisfaction signals for training and dynamically samples positives from evolving policies, tested on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Result: DRIFT achieved notable improvements over baseline methods, surpassing GPT-4o-mini in performance and preserving exploratory capacity for diverse solutions.

Conclusion: DRIFT provides an effective and scalable approach for post-training language models, leveraging dissatisfaction to refine iteration dynamics.

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/cacayaya/DRIFT.git.

*Aurélien Bück-Kaeffer,Je Qin Chooi,Dan Zhao,Maximilian Puelma Touzel,Kellin Pelrine,Jean-François Godbout,Reihaneh Rabbany,Zachary Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIMPACT, a privacy-respecting toolkit, and BluePrint, a dataset focused on political discourse, to train LLM-based social media simulation agents with behavioral fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation protocols for training LLM-based agents to accurately simulate social media dynamics in a privacy-conscious manner.

Method: SIMPACT provides tools to create personas and action datasets using anonymized behaviors and introduces metrics for assessing realism. BluePrint is constructed from anonymized Bluesky data, focusing on political discourse and social interaction patterns.

Result: SIMPACT generated BluePrint, a large dataset with 12 social media interaction types and anonymized personas, enabling LLMs to learn contextually grounded social media behavior.

Conclusion: SIMPACT standardizes data creation and evaluation for LLM-based social media simulations, providing ethical frameworks and benchmarks to advance research in misinformation and polarization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

### [49] [Small Language Models for Curriculum-based Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02347)
*Konstantinos Katharakis,Sippo Rossi,Raghava Rao Mukkamala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study benchmarks small language models (SLMs), demonstrating their ability to rival large language models (LLMs) in providing educational guidance efficiently and sustainably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of using sustainable and efficient language models for education to scale personalized learning without heavy energy or infrastructure costs.

Method: The researchers applied a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to open-source small language models (SLMs) and benchmarked their performance against GPT-4o in education-focused prompts.

Result: SLMs, when properly prompted and paired with retrieval techniques, delivered accurate educational guidance comparable to LLMs while being energy-efficient and capable of running on consumer-grade hardware.

Conclusion: SLMs are a viable alternative to LLMs for educational institutions, offering cost-effectiveness, enhanced privacy, environmental sustainability, and scalability in personalized learning.

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

*Guy Dar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces mini-vec2vec, a simpler, faster, and more robust alternative to the original vec2vec method for aligning text embedding spaces without parallel data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vec2vec has drawbacks related to computational inefficiency and instability, necessitating the development of a more efficient and reliable approach.

Method: The proposed method involves three main stages: tentative matching of pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, transformation fitting via a linear mapping, and iterative refinement.

Result: Mini-vec2vec achieves orders of magnitude higher efficiency compared to vec2vec while delivering equal or better results.

Conclusion: Mini-vec2vec improves the alignment process, is highly stable, and makes the method broadly scalable and applicable across various domains.

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

### [51] [LLMSQL: Upgrading WikiSQL for the LLM Era of Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02350)
*Dzmitry Pihulski,Karol Charchut,Viktoria Novogrodskaia,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSQL revises the WikiSQL dataset to solve major issues, enhancing its usability as a benchmark for evaluating large language models in text-to-SQL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges and structural flaws of the popular WikiSQL dataset, which hinder its utility in modern natural language interfaces to databases.

Method: The authors systematically classify errors in WikiSQL and utilize automated cleaning and re-annotation techniques to refine the dataset, ensuring better alignment with large language models.

Result: LLMSQL emerges as a cleaner, more robust benchmark tailored for testing large language models, with adjustments such as natural language questions and full SQL queries provided as plain text.

Conclusion: LLMSQL represents a significant update to WikiSQL, making it more suitable for today's text-to-SQL models and facilitating advancements in enabling non-expert users to query databases.

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

### [52] [Language, Culture, and Ideology: Personalizing Offensiveness Detection in Political Tweets with Reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02351)
*Dzmitry Pihulski,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates how large language models (LLMs) judge offensiveness in political discourse based on specific political and cultural perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand whether LLMs can adapt to nuanced political and cultural contexts when classifying offensive language.

Method: They utilize a multilingual dataset of tweets from the 2020 US elections and test recent LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1-mini, using ideological and cultural personas to assess offensiveness across English, Polish, and Russian.

Result: Larger models with explicit reasoning capabilities demonstrated better consistency and sensitivity to ideological and cultural variations. Smaller models lacked finer distinctions.

Conclusion: Reasoning abilities enhance the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments, making LLMs more suitable for complex sociopolitical text classification.

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

### [53] [Evaluating Bias in Spoken Dialogue LLMs for Real-World Decisions and Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02352)
*Yihao Wu,Tianrui Wang,Yizhou Peng,Yi-Wen Chao,Xuyi Zhuang,Xinsheng Wang,Shunshun Yin,Ziyang Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates biases in spoken dialogue models (SDMs), particularly across age, gender, and accent, and their potential impact on fairness. Results show that biases worsen over multi-turn conversations, with recommendation tasks amplifying disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and understand biases in spoken dialogue models as this area remains unexplored compared to biases in large language models.

Method: Biases were systematically evaluated using metrics like Group Unfairness Score (GUS) and similarity-based normalized statistics rate (SNSR) across open-source and closed-source models during decision-making and recommendation tasks.

Result: Closed-source models show generally lower bias, while open-source counterparts are more affected by age and gender biases. Multi-turn dialogues with negative feedback sustain biased decisions, and disparities amplify in recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: This study highlights the presence and implications of biases in SDMs, pushes for developing fair interactive audio systems, and provides the FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code for further research.

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

Abstract: This study examines the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and large
language models (LLM) to improve access to legal texts in Senegal's judicial
system. The emphasis is on the difficulties of extracting and organizing legal
documents, highlighting the need for better access to judicial information. The
research successfully extracted 7,967 articles from various legal documents,
particularly focusing on the Land and Public Domain Code. A detailed graph
database was developed, which contains 2,872 nodes and 10,774 relationships,
aiding in the visualization of interconnections within legal texts. In
addition, advanced triple extraction techniques were utilized for knowledge,
demonstrating the effectiveness of models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4, and
Mistral-Large in identifying relationships and relevant metadata. Through these
technologies, the aim is to create a solid framework that allows Senegalese
citizens and legal professionals to more effectively understand their rights
and responsibilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates abstract meaning representations in the human language cortex, using neural responses modeled by vision and language embeddings. Key findings indicate form-independent, enriched semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the debate on how abstract meaning representations are stored and processed in the language cortex.

Method: The study models neural responses to sentences using embeddings from vision and language models, leveraging aggregated multi-image and multi-paraphrase embeddings for prediction accuracy.

Result: Aggregated image embeddings predicted language cortex responses with increased accuracy, rivaling large language models. Enhancing paraphrase embeddings with implicit contextual details further improved prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that the human language cortex retains highly abstract and comprehensive semantic representations, going beyond standard language model capabilities.

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

*Guanghao Li,Zhihui Fu,Min Fang,Qibin Zhao,Ming Tang,Chun Yuan,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffuSpec introduces a diffusion-based approach to speculative decoding using pretrained models for faster language generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the latency issues in autoregressive decoding and explore more efficient multi-token drafting methods.

Method: Utilizes pretrained diffusion language models (DLMs) for multi-token drafts and introduces causal-consistency path search (CPS) and adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller to optimize performance.

Result: DiffuSpec achieves up to 3x wall-clock speedup compared to traditional methods and demonstrates reliable drafting for speculative decoding.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based drafting via DiffuSpec is a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters, offering efficiency and compatibility.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

TL;DR: Emission-GPT integrates a curated knowledge base with large language model capabilities to address inefficiencies in emissions data interpretation and analysis, enabling domain-specific question answering and interactive data exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air quality improvement and climate change mitigation require better tools for understanding and analyzing fragmented and specialized emissions knowledge.

Method: Built on a knowledge base of 10,000 documents, Emission-GPT employs prompt engineering and question completion for accurate domain-specific answering, coupled with interactive data analysis and visualization capabilities.

Result: Emission-GPT successfully extracts actionable insights from raw emissions data in a case study in Guangdong Province, such as point source distributions and sectoral trends.

Conclusion: Emission-GPT represents a powerful, modular tool for automating emissions analysis workflows, supporting improved emission inventory development and scenario-based assessments.

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

### [58] [Spiral of Silence in Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02360)
*Mingze Zhong,Meng Fang,Zijing Shi,Yuxuan Huang,Shunfeng Zheng,Yali Du,Ling Chen,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates if Spiral of Silence (SoS) dynamics, traditionally observed in human societies, can emerge in large language models (LLMs). The study introduces an evaluation framework and demonstrates that certain conditions, like incorporating history and persona, replicate SoS effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the Spiral of Silence theory, which addresses social conformity and minority suppression in humans, applies to LLMs, and to evaluate its implications for AI systems.

Method: The researchers propose an evaluation framework with controlled conditions, analyzing opinion dynamics in LLM agents using statistical tests like Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rank as well as concentration measures like kurtosis.

Result: Experiments reveal strong majority dominance and SoS patterns when history and persona signals are combined, strong anchoring from history signals alone, and fostered diversity without correlation when relying solely on persona signals.

Conclusion: The study highlights that LLMs can exhibit emergent conformity behaviors resembling SoS under certain conditions, emphasizing the importance of monitoring such dynamics for responsible AI deployment.

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

### [59] [ChunkLLM: A Lightweight Pluggable Framework for Accelerating LLMs Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02361)
*Haojie Ouyang,Jianwei Lv,Lei Ren,Chen Wei,Xiaojie Wang,Fangxiang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChunkLLM addresses the computational inefficiencies in Transformers caused by quadratic complexity by introducing components for feature compression and chunk attention, achieving significant speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models, despite their success in NLP and vision tasks, face inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with input tokens. Existing block selection and compression methods either lead to semantic incompleteness or lack efficiency.

Method: ChunkLLM introduces the QK Adapter for feature compression and chunk attention and a Chunk Adapter for detecting chunk boundaries. Training involves freezing the backbone while training adapters using a novel attention distillation method. During inference, chunk selection activates only at detected boundaries for efficiency.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ChunkLLM achieves comparable results on short-text benchmarks and retains 98.64% performance on long-context benchmarks, with a 48.58% key-value cache retention and up to 4.48x speedup on processing long texts.

Conclusion: ChunkLLM successfully offers a lightweight, pluggable training framework that mitigates computational inefficiencies in Transformers while maintaining strong performance and improved inference speed, particularly for long-text tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

### [60] [A Cross-Lingual Analysis of Bias in Large Language Models Using Romanian History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02362)
*Matei-Iulian Cocu,Răzvan-Cosmin Cristia,Adrian Marius Dumitran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) when answering controversial Romanian historical questions, examining responses across languages and contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognizing that historical perspectives are often culturally influenced and may impart biases via LLMs trained on ambiguous datasets.

Method: Questioning LLMs in three stages with binary and numerical scale responses across languages and formats, analyzing consistency and neutrality.

Result: Models often shift their stances across languages and formats, demonstrating inconsistencies; consistent models are not always accurate or neutral.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLM predispositions to response variability and bias, influenced by question context and format.

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

### [61] [Beyond Manuals and Tasks: Instance-Level Context Learning for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02369)
*Kuntai Cai,Juncheng Liu,Xianglin Yang,Zhaojie Niu,Xiaokui Xiao,Xing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for LLM agents to learn instance-specific contexts (facts tied to a particular environment) to improve task success and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers identify that the absence of instance-specific context often causes failures in LLM agents when handling complex tasks.

Method: The paper formalizes the problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduces a task-agnostic method involving guided exploration via TODO forests and a lightweight plan-act-extract loop.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements across multiple environments, increasing success rates notably, e.g., ReAct's success rate in TextWorld going from 37% to 95%.

Conclusion: Integrating instance-level context enhances LLM agents by creating reusable knowledge, complementing global and task-level contexts for improving reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

*Minsung Kim,Dong-Kyum Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Kyomin Jung,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the balance between language models' in-context and parametric knowledge during training, identifying strategies for effective knowledge arbitration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflicting use of in-context and parametric knowledge in large language models during retrieval-augmented generation and to reduce potential inefficiencies in pretraining.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments using transformer-based language models trained on a synthetic biographies corpus, systematically varying conditions like data repetitions and inconsistencies.

Result: The study found that repetitions foster both in-context and parametric learning, while training with inconsistent or skewed data improves arbitration strategies.

Conclusion: Seemingly undesirable training properties, like data inconsistency or skew, actually play a key role in learning robust strategies, offering actionable guidelines for pretraining language models.

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

*Hadi Pouransari,David Grangier,C Thomas,Michael Kirchhof,Oncel Tuzel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a memory-augmented architecture for small language models that leverages hierarchical parametric memory banks to improve performance without significantly increasing the model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling modern language models with large parameters is inefficient for edge devices and often unnecessary, prompting the need for architectures that balance performance and resource constraints.

Method: Small language models are paired with context-dependent hierarchical parametric memory banks which store world knowledge. These memories are accessed and integrated dynamically during pretraining and inference.

Result: A compact language model (160M parameters) combined with memory banks outperformed larger models, demonstrating significant efficiency and performance gains with reduced parameter usage.

Conclusion: Hierarchical feed-forward memory banks offer a robust mechanism to enhance transformer models, enabling high performance while mitigating resource limitations and aligning well with hardware constraints.

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method for choosing the most reliable response from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) using calibrated log-likelihood scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting the best response from multiple LLMs in resource-constrained settings is challenging, as current approaches require costly external tools or self-consistency techniques.

Method: The proposed method uses calibrated log-likelihood scores, leveraging the inherent confidence and knowledge of LLMs to select optimal responses.

Result: The method improves performance by approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets across debate and non-debate settings.

Conclusion: This approach offers a principled, diverse, and computationally efficient solution to improve multi-LLM systems without the need for expensive external evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets
respectively.

*Haoyue Bai,Haoyu Wang,Shengyu Chen,Zhengzhang Chen,Lu-An Tang,Wei Cheng,Haifeng Chen,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rule-driven routing framework enhancing the performance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems by effectively combining databases and documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based QA systems struggle in domain-specific environments requiring precise and current information, with existing RAG systems leaning on unstructured documents and neglecting structured relational databases.

Method: The authors propose a rule-driven routing framework, comprising a scoring module for selecting suitable augmentation paths, a rule-making expert that evolves rules using QA feedback, and a meta-cache for reusing prior routing decisions.

Result: The framework achieves higher accuracy and balanced computational cost than static strategies and learned baselines across three QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that systematic and adaptive routing decisions improve RAG systems by leveraging complementary strengths of databases and documents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) update their knowledge systematically through "KnowledgeSmith," a unified evaluation framework for knowledge editing and machine unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the knowledge updating (editing and unlearning) mechanism of LLMs, which has been insufficiently studied due to lack of comprehensive and large-scale evaluations.

Method: The paper introduces "KnowledgeSmith," a framework to study knowledge modification in LLMs using constrained optimization and an automatic dataset generator for controlled experiments.

Result: Key insights include evidence that LLMs update knowledge differently than humans, discover a trade-off between consistency and capacity, and evaluate nuanced effects of knowledge propagation and robustness.

Conclusion: Findings from this paper aim to inform the design of more effective and scalable LLM updating strategies.

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of translating NL queries with domain-specific vocabulary into SQL, considering the relationship between embedded domain expressions and DB schema structure.

Method: Introduces a framework for associating structured domain statements at the database level and retrieves them with sub-string level match for better accuracy.

Result: Demonstrates that structured domain statements are more practical and accurate for mapping NL to SQL, and sub-string match retrieval is superior to alternatives.

Conclusion: Using structured statements and sub-string retrieval improves the LLMs' accuracy in executing NL-to-SQL translations in diverse domains.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether sensory prompts can activate latent multimodal representations within text-only large language models (LLMs), aligning them with specialist vision and audio encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore if solely text-trained LLMs, which lack direct sensory input, can access implicit multimodal regularities encoded in language through sensory prompting.

Method: Lightweight prompt engineering is used, where sensory prompts like 'see' or 'hear' are introduced to cue LLMs to simulate visual or auditory evidence in their token predictions.

Result: The findings demonstrate that sensory prompts successfully activate modality-appropriate representations in text-only LLMs, aligning them more closely with multimodal specialist encoders.

Conclusion: Text-only LLMs can utilize latent multimodal structures with sensory prompts, revealing their potential to perform multimodal tasks without explicit sensory data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to study how language models, particularly transformers, learn syntax using synthetic languages derived from probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the learning dynamics of language models in domains like natural language and syntax, as their current mechanisms remain largely unexplored.

Method: The authors use synthetic PCFG-based languages to control grammar conditions and analyze transformers' training loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence patterns. They perform both theoretical proofs and empirical tests.

Result: It was found that transformers reduce loss across grammar substructures in parallel, struggle with deeper recursive structures, and benefit from subgrammar pretraining in terms of final loss and alignment with grammar substructures.

Conclusion: This work highlights fundamental challenges in how neural networks handle hierarchical syntax and presents PCFGs as a powerful testbed for understanding the learning dynamics of transformers, pointing to opportunities for further research.

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cobweb, a hierarchy-aware framework for document retrieval, emphasizing interpretable and efficient retrieval through hierarchical prototype trees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural retrieval systems often overlook corpus structure and provide opaque explanations, necessitating methods that utilize structure and improve result interpretability.

Method: Cobweb organizes sentence embeddings into a prototype tree, leveraging coarse-to-fine traversal for document ranking. It offers two inference models: generalized best-first search and path-sum ranker.

Result: Experiments on MS MARCO and QQP datasets demonstrate Cobweb’s competitive performance, robustness to degraded embedding quality, and improved interpretability compared to flat vector-based searches.

Conclusion: Cobweb enhances retrieval effectiveness, robustness, scalability, and interpretability, showcasing its potential as an alternative to traditional vector search methods.

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

TL;DR: The paper improves upon traditional methods of evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by introducing a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics struggle to evaluate high fluency and naturalness in LLM-generated content within RAG systems.

Method: The authors extend the RAGAS evaluation tool by incorporating multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering using a knowledge graph-based approach.

Result: The KG-based evaluation demonstrates higher sensitivity to semantic differences and aligns better with human judgment compared to traditional RAGAS scores.

Conclusion: The paper provides a more nuanced evaluation method for RAG systems and outlines challenges and future research directions in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the transformation performed by modality adapters (MAs) in SLMs, which are key to integrating speech with large language models, yet poorly understood.

Method: Analyzing the MA output representation in three SLMs by identifying the nearest decoder language model token to each MA representation and classifying their approaches based on speech encoder type.

Result: Two strategies for MA representation were found: (1) Using a Whisper encoder, MAs create an English-based interlingua to encode meaning; (2) Without a Whisper encoder, MAs represent phonetics via English words.

Conclusion: The representation strategy used by MAs depends on whether the speech encoder is trained for recognition or translation, highlighting the role of encoder training in MA functioning.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

### [74] [Evaluation Framework for Highlight Explanations of Context Utilisation in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02629)
*Jingyi Sun,Pepa Atanasova,Sagnik Ray Choudhury,Sekh Mainul Islam,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gold-standard evaluation framework for Highlight Explanations (HEs) to measure their accuracy in explaining how Language Models (LMs) utilize context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability of LMs to transparently use context in generating responses is opaque to users, who struggle to identify what parts of the context influence outputs or whether the model relies on parametric memory.

Method: The authors propose a novel HE evaluation framework using test cases with known ground-truth context usage. They evaluate four HE techniques across multiple datasets, scenarios, and Language Models, adapting MechLight as a mechanistic interpretability method.

Result: Among evaluated methods, MechLight achieves the best overall performance. However, all evaluated methods face challenges with longer contexts and positional biases, undermining explanation accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings highlight fundamental issues in HE methods' ability to provide reliable context utilization explanations, underscoring the need for innovative techniques.

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

### [75] [Mind the Gap: Linguistic Divergence and Adaptation Strategies in Human-LLM Assistant vs. Human-Human Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02645)
*Fulei Zhang,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how user communication differs when interacting with LLM chatbots compared to human agents, highlighting significant language variations and proposing strategies to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the differences in communication styles between users interacting with chatbots versus human agents, ensuring that LLMs adapt effectively to real-world deployment scenarios.

Method: Two strategies were tested: (1) data augmentation to diversify stylistic input during training and (2) reformulating user messages during inference to match desired styles.

Result: Training on stylistically diverse datasets significantly improved LLM performance and adaptability, while inference-time reformulation was comparatively less effective.

Conclusion: Better training methods, especially data augmentation, enhance LLM robustness and adaptability to communication style changes, improving user interaction experiences.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

*Rui Qi,Zhibo Man,Yufeng Chen,Fengran Mo,Jinan Xu,Kaiyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method to enhance multilingual reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) using structured representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reasoning capabilities of LLMs do not extend well to non-high-resource languages due to resource constraints, posing challenges for multilingual reasoning tasks.

Method: SoT operates through two transformations: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge Transformation. It develops language-agnostic structured representations for deeper reasoning across languages.

Result: Experiments show SoT significantly improves the performance of LLMs on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks compared to strong baselines across various model backbones.

Conclusion: SoT is a practical and effective method for enhancing multilingual reasoning and can be paired with other training-free approaches for further optimization. Code is publicly available for replication and integration.

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper surveys the current state of self-improvement techniques for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), discussing data strategies and model enhancement methods, and highlighting challenges and future research areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend self-improvement techniques from unimodal LLMs to MLLMs, leveraging diverse data sources to improve efficiency and generalization in multimodal tasks.

Method: The paper systematically categorizes existing methods into three areas: data collection, data organization, and model optimization, and evaluates their effectiveness in fostering self-improvement in MLLMs.

Result: It compiles existing literature, commonly used evaluations, and applications, establishing a structured approach to advancing MLLMs' self-improvement.

Conclusion: Self-improvement in MLLMs is promising but requires addressing open challenges such as efficient data management and optimization methods, paving the way for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have
efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs,
particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively
young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for
leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving
models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of
self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview
of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data
collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the
further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used
evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open
challenges and future research directions.

*Yavuz Bakman,Sungmin Kang,Zhiqi Huang,Duygu Nur Yaldiz,Catarina G. Belém,Chenyang Zhu,Anoop Kumar,Alfy Samuel,Salman Avestimehr,Daben Liu,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretically grounded method to address uncertainty quantification (UQ) specifically for contextual question answering (QA). This involves decomposing epistemic uncertainty through token-level measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the gap in uncertainty quantification for contextual QA, which hasn't been explored yet despite its significance in real-world applications.

Method: The paper introduces a theoretical framework to define token-level uncertainty through cross-entropy decomposition, particularly isolating epistemic uncertainty. Semantic feature gaps relative to an ideal model are used as proxies for epistemic uncertainty, derived through three features: context-reliance, context comprehension, and honesty.

Result: Experiments conducted across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that their method improves uncertainty quantification performance significantly, achieving up to a 13-point PRR improvement with minimal inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective for contextual QA and surpasses existing state-of-the-art UQ methods, suggesting it is a viable solution for improving real-world QA capabilities.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

### [79] [Time-To-Inconsistency: A Survival Analysis of Large Language Model Robustness to Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02712)
*Yubo Li,Ramayya Krishnan,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn dialogues using survival analysis, revealing factors like semantic drift that affect conversational failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding and appropriate evaluation of LLM robustness during extended conversations, which is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: The study employs a survival analysis framework, incorporating Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest techniques, to analyze 36,951 conversation turns across 9 LLMs.

Result: The analysis reveals that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift greatly increases the chance of failure, while gradual drift protects against it, enabling longer conversations.

Conclusion: The study establishes survival analysis as a valuable method for evaluating LLM robustness and offers new insights for designing more resilient conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

### [80] [TravelBench : Exploring LLM Performance in Low-Resource Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02719)
*Srinivas Billa,Xiaonan Jing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' performance in low-resource, travel-domain NLP tasks and finds that general benchmarks are insufficient for capturing their capabilities in such scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively assess LLMs' effectiveness in low-resource tasks, prompting the need for task-specific analysis.

Method: The authors curated 14 travel-domain datasets spanning 7 tasks using real-world anonymized data, and evaluated LLMs' accuracy, scaling, and reasoning abilities.

Result: General benchmarks were deemed inadequate for low-resource tasks, with performance bottlenecks noted in domain-specific, complex scenarios even for large LLMs. Reasoning substantially aided smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: Understanding LLM performance in low-resource settings requires task-specific benchmarking, highlighting the need for domain-specific evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

*KM Pooja,Cheng Long,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a generative adversarial network-based method for multimodal entity linking (MEL) that leverages high-quality negative samples, showing better performance on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve multimodal entity linking (MEL) by exploring the impact of high-quality negative samples, which has been overlooked in current research.

Method: The authors use a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework where a generator produces challenging negative samples, and a discriminator focuses on metric learning. Policy gradient techniques are used to optimize the generator due to the discrete nature of sample generation.

Result: Experimental evaluation on datasets including Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL, and WikiDiverse shows that the proposed PGMEL method outperforms existing techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning meaningful representations by using challenging negative samples.

Conclusion: The proposed PGMEL effectively enhances multimodal entity linking by addressing the unexplored area of using high-quality negative samples, advancing the understanding of MEL tasks and offering better performance than current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Santhosh G S,Akshay Govind S,Gokul S Krishnan,Balaraman Ravindran,Sriraam Natarajan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper outlines an evaluation framework for bias in LLMs in an Indian context, introduces a dataset called IndiCASA, and highlights stereotypical biases, especially disability-related, in tested models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for rigorous bias evaluation in LLMs, particularly in culturally complex regions like India, where conventional methods fail to capture nuanced stereotypes.

Method: The authors developed an evaluation framework using an encoder with contrastive learning to measure bias through embedding similarity. Additionally, they introduced the IndiCASA dataset, which contains 2,575 validated sentences across various demographic categories.

Result: They found that all tested LLMs exhibit stereotypical biases to varying extents, with persistent biases related to disability and comparatively lower religion biases, likely due to global debiasing efforts.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity of context-aware and fairer LLM development, particularly to address biases in culturally diverse settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for large language models (LLMs) that minimizes the need for manual data by incorporating self-awareness, achieving significant performance gains with minimal additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL) but reduce the significant manual effort and data requirements usually associated with traditional RL training.

Method: The paper introduces two self-aware mechanisms: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, for prioritizing challenging but solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, which prompts the model to request external data when confronting tasks beyond its capabilities. These components allow the LLM to alternate between proposing and solving tasks.

Result: The approach showed a 53.8% relative improvement across nine benchmarks, utilizing less than 1.2% additional data, validating the effectiveness of the self-aware RL strategy.

Conclusion: Self-aware RL mechanisms enable LLMs to enhance themselves with minimal reliance on external data, demonstrating the potential for self-evolving training through enhanced self-awareness mechanisms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents XTRA, a cross-lingual topic modeling framework that achieves enhanced topic coherence, diversity, and alignment by unifying bag-of-words modeling with multilingual embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-lingual topic modeling methods struggle with achieving both high topic coherence and consistent topic alignment across languages.

Method: The proposed XTRA framework employs two main components: representation alignment via contrastive learning in a shared semantic space and topic alignment by projecting topic-word distributions into the same space.

Result: Experimental results on multilingual corpora demonstrate that XTRA surpasses strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity, and alignment quality.

Conclusion: XTRA's dual alignment mechanisms enable it to generate interpretable and cross-lingually consistent topics, significantly advancing the state of cross-lingual topic modeling.

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

### [85] [A Computational Framework for Interpretable Text-Based Personality Assessment from Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02811)
*Matej Gjurković*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research focuses on automated personality assessment using NLP with two main contributions: datasets (MBTI9k and PANDORA) and the SIMPA framework for interpretable personality identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in utilizing NLP for personality assessment, specifically the lack of large labeled datasets and bridging the gap between NLP and personality psychology.

Method: Two datasets, MBTI9k and PANDORA from Reddit, were introduced to improve data quality and coverage. Additionally, the SIMPA framework was developed using machine learning and semantic similarity for assessing personality in an interpretable manner.

Result: PANDORA provided an extensive dataset with 17 million comments, combined with demographic data. Experiments revealed demographic influences on model validity. SIMPA achieved personality assessments comparable to human evaluations.

Conclusion: The datasets and SIMPA framework advance the automation and interpretability of personality assessment, offering applicability to diverse domains beyond personality analysis.

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

*Tengjun Ni,Xin Yuan,Shenghong Li,Kai Wu,Ren Ping Liu,Wei Ni,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG improves multi-hop question answering (QA) by combining question decomposition and BFS reasoning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets while enhancing accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge retrieval in multi-hop QA tasks.

Method: StepChain GraphRAG introduces a framework combining question decomposition, dynamic BFS-based traversal, and on-the-fly parsing of retrieved passages into a knowledge graph.

Result: The framework outperformed the state-of-the-art on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA, with significant improvements in Exact Match (+2.57%) and F1 (+2.13%) scores.

Conclusion: The approach offers enhanced accuracy and explainability in multi-hop QA while pointing toward avenues for refining computational efficiency and mitigating hallucinations in future research.

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

*Shinya Uryu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the performance of leading LLMs on species evaluation, finding strengths in taxonomy but significant weaknesses in conservation reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the reliability and limitations of LLMs in addressing conservation-related challenges, particularly for species evaluations.

Method: Five leading LLMs were systematically validated on 21,955 species across four IUCN Red List components.

Result: Models performed well in taxonomy classification (94.9%) but poorly in conservation reasoning (27.2%), with biases favoring charismatic species.

Conclusion: LLMs are useful for information retrieval but require human oversight for evaluative and judgment-based tasks, recommending a hybrid human-LLM approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper formulates Wordle as a formal constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), introducing novel solving strategies like CSP-Aware Entropy and Probabilistic CSP. These approaches outperform existing ones in efficiency and success rates, even under noise and cross-language validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance CSP-solving techniques for structured puzzle games, addressing limitations in existing entropy-maximization and frequency-based methods by proposing formal constraint treatment.

Method: The authors developed CSP-Aware Entropy, focusing on information gain post-constraint propagation, and introduced a Probabilistic CSP framework combining Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints.

Result: CSP-Aware Entropy achieved 99.9% success with an average of 3.54 guesses, 46% faster runtime, and maintained advantages under noise. The Probabilistic CSP maintained 100% success across noise levels. Cross-lexicon validation showed effective transferability across languages.

Conclusion: Formal CSP techniques combined with probabilistic-logical frameworks outperform classical methods in efficiency, success rates, robustness, and cross-language adaptability for structured puzzle-solving domains.

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

### [89] [Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02919)
*Jian Mu,Qixin Zhang,Zhiyong Wang,Menglin Yang,Shuang Qiu,Chengwei Qin,Zhongxiang Dai,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SRGen, which enhances LLM reasoning by self-reflecting on uncertain token generations at test time, showing significant accuracy improvements with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often make cascading errors during autoregressive token generation due to initial inaccuracies, creating a need for self-reflective mechanisms to mitigate these errors.

Method: SRGen dynamically identifies uncertain tokens during generation using entropy thresholds and retroactively trains corrective vectors to adjust probabilities based on the generated context.

Result: SRGen improved performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding notable accuracy boosts (e.g., +12.0% on Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5 for AIME2024 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B), while maintaining compatibility with other techniques.

Conclusion: SRGen provides a lightweight and adaptable framework for enhancing the reliability of LLM reasoning processes at test time, significantly improving outcomes without requiring expensive retraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

TL;DR: The Conversational Data Retrieval (CDR) benchmark is introduced to evaluate retrieval systems for product-related conversational data, featuring 1.6k queries and 9.1k conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to fill the gap in standardized benchmarks for assessing retrieval systems that handle conversational data, particularly for product insights.

Method: They created and evaluated a benchmark with 1.6k queries and 9.1k conversations, analyzing the performance of 16 embedding models using tasks addressing the challenges in conversational data retrieval.

Result: The best-performing models achieved only NDCG@10 of 0.51, highlighting limitations in current conversational data retrieval capabilities.

Conclusion: The benchmark identifies specific challenges in conversational data retrieval, supports future advancements, and provides publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: We present the Conversational Data Retrieval (CDR) benchmark, the first
comprehensive test set for evaluating systems that retrieve conversation data
for product insights. With 1.6k queries across five analytical tasks and 9.1k
conversations, our benchmark provides a reliable standard for measuring
conversational data retrieval performance. Our evaluation of 16 popular
embedding models shows that even the best models reach only around NDCG@10 of
0.51, revealing a substantial gap between document and conversational data
retrieval capabilities. Our work identifies unique challenges in conversational
data retrieval (implicit state recognition, turn dynamics, contextual
references) while providing practical query templates and detailed error
analysis across different task categories. The benchmark dataset and code are

*Jingqi Zhang,Ruibo Chen,Yingqing Yang,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang,Yan Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework for detecting the unauthorized use of copyrighted datasets in fine-tuning language models, employing watermarking without degrading text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of safeguarding against unauthorized use of proprietary or copyrighted datasets during LLM fine-tuning.

Method: TRACE introduces distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key and exploits entropy-gated procedures to amplify detection power in a black-box setting.

Result: TRACE achieves strong and statistically significant detections across diverse datasets, maintaining robustness against continued pretraining.

Conclusion: TRACE offers a practical and robust approach for verifying the unauthorized use of copyrighted datasets in language model fine-tuning, with consistent statistical reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

*Matthew Lewis,Samuel Thio,Richard JB Dobson,Spiros Denaxas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study develops a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to efficiently query NICE clinical guidelines using Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare guidelines are often too long and extensive, making it difficult for practitioners to access relevant information quickly.

Method: The RAG system uses a hybrid embedding-based retrieval architecture to retrieve relevant chunks from a large database of clinical guidelines, followed by generating precise answers using enhanced LLMs.

Result: The system achieved high retrieval performance (MRR of 0.814, Recall of 81%-99.1%) and significantly improved answer faithfulness, achieving 99.5% faithfulness compared to 43% for a medical-specific LLM.

Conclusion: The RAG system is reliable, scalable, and effectively prevents information fabrication, providing cost-effective access to clinical guidelines and supporting its application in healthcare scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

*Rongchen Guo,Vincent Francoeur,Isar Nejadgholi,Sylvain Gagnon,Miodrag Bolic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the link between descriptive and expressive semantics in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), showing descriptive semantics align with intended emotions and expressive semantics with evoked emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to enhance the accuracy of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) for human-computer interaction, addressing the challenge of speech's emotional complexity.

Method: Participants recorded audio clips describing their experiences after viewing emotional movie segments. Data included intended emotion tags, self-rated emotional responses, and valence/arousal scores to analyze correlations.

Result: Descriptive semantics were found to align with intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlated more strongly with actual evoked emotions.

Conclusion: The study suggests SER applications can benefit by distinguishing descriptive and expressive semantics to create more context-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way
for more context-aware AI systems.

*Oriol Pareras,Gerard I. Gállego,Federico Costa,Cristina España-Bonet,Javier Hernando*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Direct prompting for Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), finding that Direct prompting improves more with increasing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how prompting strategies (CoT vs Direct) perform in S2TT under different data scales, given the growing use of LLMs in this domain.

Method: The authors pseudo-labeled an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six European languages and trained systems using both CoT and Direct prompting with varying amounts of data.

Result: Direct prompting showed greater improvement as the dataset expanded, while CoT typically starts strong due to access to diverse data types.

Conclusion: Direct prompting may become the more effective strategy as larger S2TT datasets are developed.

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

*Beth Pearson,Ahmed Adnan,Zahraa Abdallah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of comparing radiology reports for training purposes using AI, proposing a novel model, Llama-EntScore, which outperforms traditional and standalone AI approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the training of junior radiologists and enhance diagnostic accuracy by identifying semantic differences between preliminary and final radiology reports, leveraging AI despite the challenges posed by the need for specialized domain knowledge.

Method: The study compares large language models (LLMs), Named-Entity-Recognition (NER), and introduces Llama-EntScore, which combines Llama 3.1 and NER with adjustable weights for scoring semantic similarity between reports.

Result: Llama-EntScore achieved 67% exact-match accuracy and 93% accuracy within ±1 of radiologist-provided scores, outperforming standalone LLMs and NER. Its interpretative and tunable capabilities provide additional value.

Conclusion: Llama-EntScore offers a superior method for comparing radiology reports, providing accurate and explainable feedback that aids in training junior radiologists and improving reporting practices.

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Explores limitations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) speech-to-text translation and suggests improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address error propagation and missed acoustic cues in cascaded S2TT systems.

Method: Used attribution methods, robustness testing, and prosody analysis on CoT models.

Result: CoT mainly relies on transcripts, barely utilizing speech data; interventions improved robustness.

Conclusion: CoT's advantages are questioned, calling for designs that integrate acoustic information better.

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SurveyBench, a quiz-driven evaluation framework designed to assess and improve the quality of surveys generated by AI models, addressing deficiencies in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven survey generation methods often fail to meet human-level standards, and there is no rigorous benchmark to evaluate their shortcomings or alignment with human informational needs.

Method: SurveyBench features survey topics derived from 11,343 arXiv papers and 4,947 high-quality surveys. It establishes a multifaceted metric hierarchy (e.g., coverage breadth, synthesis granularity) and employs a dual-mode evaluation protocol including content-based and quiz-based answerability tests.

Result: SurveyBench demonstrates that existing LLM4Survey methods perform significantly below human standards, with an average 21% lower score in content-based evaluations.

Conclusion: SurveyBench provides a rigorous evaluation framework, helping to identify and address deficiencies in AI-generated surveys, aligning them better with reader needs.

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) lack proper confidence calibration in non-English languages, reducing reliability. A new approach, LACE, optimizes calibration by leveraging intermediate model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the systematic issue that LLMs exhibit worse confidence calibration for non-English languages, which hinders their reliability and trustworthiness for global deployment.

Method: The study conducts multilingual calibration experiments across six model families and over 100 languages, using internal layer-wise analysis to identify calibration trends and proposes training-free methods like LACE for improvement.

Result: The paper reveals that intermediate layers provide better calibration signals compared to the final layers biased by English-centric training, improving multilingual reliability.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of moving beyond final-layer analysis to enhance multilingual calibration and present methods, such as LACE, to ensure equitable and globally robust LLMs.

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

*Katherine Thai,Bradley Emi,Elyas Masrour,Mohit Iyyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods for distinguishing AI-edited text from human-written and fully AI-generated text using lightweight similarity metrics and a regression model named EditLens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While earlier studies focused on identifying fully AI-generated text, there is a growing need to explore how AI edits human-provided text, given the rising usage of AI tools for text refinement.

Method: The authors devise similarity metrics to measure the extent of AI editing in a text. These metrics are validated by human annotators and used to train a regression model called EditLens, which predicts the degree of AI editing in the text.

Result: EditLens achieves high classification performance, with F1 scores of 94.7% on binary tasks and 90.4% on ternary tasks, in differentiating among human, AI, and mixed-origin writings.

Conclusion: AI-edited text is distinguishable from other text types, and the degree of AI involvement can be detected. The work advances understanding in authorship attribution, policy, and education and includes an analysis of AI edits from Grammarly as a case study.

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether previously observed correlations between LLMs’ hidden states and brain activity are valid under various concerns and parameters.

Method: The authors apply dimensionality reduction, new similarity measures, model comparisons, and assessments based on positional encoding to test robustness.

Result: Prior findings are upheld, showing that the correlations are not artifacts of dimensionality, specific to models trained on language, and reliant on positional encoding.

Conclusion: The robustness of previous results strengthens arguments for the interpretability and biological plausibility of large language models.

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models (LLMs), investigating its superiority over neural topic models (NTMs) through zero-shot prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) to redefine topic modeling as a long-form generation task, addressing the limitation of traditional neural topic models (NTMs).

Method: The paper proposes implementing LLM-based topic modeling through a practical approach involving subset sampling, topic and representative text generation via prompts, and text assignment using keyword matching. A systematic comparison with NTMs is conducted to assess topic quality.

Result: The study demonstrates that the LLM-based topic modeling paradigm offers substantial promise and outperforms NTMs in terms of topic quality under specific circumstances.

Conclusion: The findings support the claim that NTMs may be outdated in comparison to modern LLM-based approaches, positioning LLMs as effective tools for topic modeling.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

TL;DR: This paper introduces NN-Rank, a ranking algorithm for cross-lingual transfer, achieving state-of-the-art results in part-of-speech tagging (POS) and named entity recognition (NER).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ranking of source languages for cross-lingual transfer using hidden representations from multilingual models and small amounts of unlabeled target-language data.

Method: The paper introduces NN-Rank, leveraging multilingual model representations for ranking and evaluates it on POS and NER tasks using 51 source and up to 72 target languages. It also assesses NN-Rank's performance with minimal in-domain and out-of-domain target language data.

Result: NN-Rank outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with significant improvements in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). It works well even with out-of-domain or minimal target language data and achieves 92.8% of best performance with as few as 25 examples.

Conclusion: NN-Rank is an effective and flexible algorithm for ranking source languages in cross-lingual transfer, setting a new performance benchmark for scalable multilingual applications.

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

*Imene Kerboua,Sahar Omidi Shayegan,Megh Thakkar,Xing Han Lù,Léo Boisvert,Massimo Caccia,Jérémy Espinas,Alexandre Aussem,Véronique Eglin,Alexandre Lacoste*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FocusAgent uses a lightweight LLM retriever to prune web page observations based on task goals, improving computational efficiency and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and security issues web agents face when processing lengthy web page observations that exceed context limits.

Method: FocusAgent extracts relevant lines from AxTree observations using a lightweight LLM retriever based on task goals, reducing irrelevant content.

Result: FocusAgent reduces observation size by over 50% while maintaining strong task performance, and mitigates prompt-injection attacks effectively.

Conclusion: Targeted, LLM-based retrieval like FocusAgent enhances web agents' efficiency, effectiveness, and security.

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

### [104] [Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03215)
*Tianyu Fu,Zihan Min,Hanling Zhang,Jichao Yan,Guohao Dai,Wanli Ouyang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a paradigm for direct semantic communication between Large Language Models (LLMs) using enriched KV-Cache instead of text-based communication. C2C improves performance, accuracy, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-LLM systems rely on text-based communication, which loses semantic richness and introduces latency. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The paper proposes Cache-to-Cache (C2C), where a neural network projects and fuses KV-caches of source and target LLMs, with a learnable gating mechanism selecting optimal target layers.

Result: C2C achieves higher average accuracy by 8.5-10.5% compared to individual models, surpasses text communication by 3.0-5.0%, and speeds up latency by 2.0x.

Conclusion: Cache-to-Cache leverages direct semantic communication to enhance multi-LLM systems, avoiding inefficiencies of text-based communication while significantly improving performance and speed.

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

### [105] [Self-Anchor: Large Language Model Reasoning via Step-by-step Attention Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03223)
*Hongxiang Zhang,Yuan Tian,Tianyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Anchor improves the focus of Large Language Models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by structuring and aligning attention during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning tasks for Large Language Models face challenges when reasoning chains become lengthy, causing critical intermediate steps to receive insufficient attention—leading to errors.

Method: Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to relevant inference steps, keeping focus consistent throughout generation.

Result: The method outperforms existing prompting approaches across six benchmarks and narrows the gap between general-purpose and specialized reasoning models.

Conclusion: Self-Anchor demonstrates the capability of enabling LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks efficiently without requiring retraining.

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

*Sebastian Gehrmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the integration of reward models, used in reinforcement learning for model output evaluation, with evaluation metrics, examining overlapping research challenges and proposing collaborative improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify overlapping issues in the separate fields of reward modeling and evaluation metrics and advocate for collaboration to enhance the reliability, calibration, and overall utility of model assessment tools.

Method: Performed a comparative analysis and survey of reward models and evaluation metrics, highlighting pitfalls and opportunities for mutual improvement across the domains.

Result: Demonstrated areas where metrics outperform reward models and identified overlapping challenges such as spurious correlations and reward hacking. Proposed research topics for collaborative advancements.

Conclusion: A more unified research approach between these areas can enable better quality assessments, improved data handling, and more robust evaluation techniques for AI models.

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces EEFSUVA, a benchmark sourced from less common math Olympiads, to evaluate large language models' mathematical reasoning abilities and highlights their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to critically evaluate claims that LLMs possess advanced mathematical reasoning based on existing benchmarks, addressing concerns about dataset bias and data contamination.

Method: They propose EEFSUVA, a benchmark derived from lesser-known Eastern European and Soviet Union math Olympiads, to test LLM performance on problems requiring nonstandard problem-solving approaches.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show a significant decline in performance on the EEFSUVA benchmark compared to more mainstream Olympiad-style benchmarks.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks may overstate LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities, and broader datasets like EEFSUVA are essential for comprehensive performance evaluation and guiding future model improvements.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Oracle-RLAIF, a new framework for cost-efficient fine-tuning of large video-language models using AI feedback and ranking-based optimization methods, leading to better performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs of gathering human feedback for fine-tuning large VLMs and the limitations of current AI-based reward models that rely on scalar scoring systems.

Method: Proposes Oracle-RLAIF, which uses a general ranker for model alignment instead of a scalar reward model, combined with a novel rank-based loss function called $GRPO_{rank}$ to optimize ordinal feedback.

Result: Oracle-RLAIF outperforms state-of-the-art VLM fine-tuning methods across various video comprehension benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF offers a flexible and data-efficient alternative for aligning large multi-modal video models, leveraging rank-based optimization instead of scalar scoring systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PhysHMR, a method to reconstruct realistic human motion from monocular videos using a unified physics-based approach, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing realistic human motion from monocular videos is difficult due to a lack of physical constraints in existing methods, which often yield unrealistic results.

Method: PhysHMR integrates a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control within a physics-based simulator, utilizing a 'pixel-as-ray' strategy for 3D pose guidance, and a distillation scheme for transferring motion knowledge.

Result: PhysHMR achieves high-quality reconstructions that are both visually accurate and physically plausible, surpassing prior methods in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: PhysHMR effectively combines physics-based constraints and visual features to deliver superior human motion reconstructions with greater fidelity and realism.

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study examines how human-machine collaborative systems impact decision-making accuracy in face recognition and establishes when fusion improves system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how human-machine collaboration can enhance accuracy in face identification and establish guidelines for their optimal integration.

Method: The study analyzed expert and non-expert face identifiers to evaluate collaboration benefits, developed the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR) to predict fusion benefits, and used graph theory to optimize human-only and human-machine partnerships.

Result: Combining humans and machines improved system accuracy when differences in their baseline abilities were minimal, with intelligent fusion outperforming machines and humans acting independently.

Conclusion: Intelligent human-machine collaboration is an effective way to enhance face recognition accuracy and mitigate the impact of low-performing humans, offering a guide for AI implementation in critical decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for uncertainty quantification in generative video models, addressing hallucination issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the safety concerns posed by the hallucination tendencies of generative video models and the lack of existing uncertainty quantification methods.

Method: The framework involves a metric for calibration, a black-box uncertainty quantification method (S-QUBED) that decomposes uncertainties, and a UQ dataset for benchmarking video models.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that S-QUBED provides calibrated uncertainty estimates negatively correlated with task accuracy and effectively distinguishes between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the critical gap in quantifying uncertainty in video generation models, offering a systematic and robust approach to improve model calibration.

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO) to enhance aesthetic quality in images generated by text-to-image diffusion models using an optimized text embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the aesthetic quality of images generated from simple, uncurated prompts using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models.

Method: The approach employs an optimization of text embeddings based on a tripartite objective: improving visual aesthetics, adhering to optimized embeddings, and preserving prompt fidelity.

Result: PEO demonstrates superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art text-to-image generation methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: PEO is effective, training-free, independent of model backbones, and enhances the aesthetic output with optimized text-to-image embeddings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in 3D hand-and-object tracking in realistic, unconstrained environments using a novel marker-less multi-camera system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets and tracking systems have limited environmental diversity and poor model generalization, primarily due to being captured in controlled laboratory setups.

Method: The authors propose a setup combining a back-mounted capture rig with multiple exocentric cameras and a headset with egocentric views. They design an ego-exo tracking pipeline for accurate 3D hand pose annotation in realistic conditions.

Result: A high-quality annotated dataset of synchronized multi-view images and accurate 3D hand poses was created, effectively balancing environmental realism and annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: Their method improves 3D hand tracking by bridging the trade-off between environmental realism and data accuracy, providing a way forward for advancements in egocentric computer vision.

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the inefficiency of diffusion-based co-speech video synthesis by proposing a new video distillation method optimizing performance and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based models for co-speech video synthesis are too slow for real-time applications due to extensive denoising steps and costly computations.

Method: A distillation technique is used to reduce many-step diffusion into a few-step process, employing input-aware sparse attention and an input-aware distillation loss.

Result: The proposed method achieves real-time co-speech video synthesis with enhanced visual quality, improving lip synchronization, hand motion realism, and motion coherence.

Conclusion: The paper successfully improves efficiency and video quality, resolving existing issues in diffusion-based models, making them viable for real-time use.

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel technique called FunLoRA, which addresses issues of catastrophic forgetting in generative models during continual training by using a more expressive conditioning mechanism. It outperforms existing methods while being memory- and time-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in incremental training of generative models, specifically the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon and the inefficiency of retraining on synthetic data.

Method: The authors propose a new approach, FunLoRA, which uses functional low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based on rank-1 matrices and dynamic conditioning. This avoids reliance on synthetic data and trains only on the current task data.

Result: FunLoRA improves classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models using diffusion-based techniques, while greatly reducing memory overhead and training time.

Conclusion: FunLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that resolves key challenges in continual training of generative models, offering better long-term performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

TL;DR: The study introduces a robustness framework for recognizing traffic lights and signs, addressing digital and natural degradation. It uses temporal sequences and multi-source datasets to improve classification accuracy and defense against perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies gaps in existing AV perception models, which lack adequate robustness to degradation and temporal continuity. These issues are critical as perception mistakes can compromise safety and navigation.

Method: A dual field-of-view and sequence-preserving framework is proposed using multi-source datasets. A three-layer defense stack involves feature squeezing, defensive distillation, anomaly detection, and sequence-wise temporal voting.

Result: Experiments confirmed 79.8mAP accuracy, a reduced attack success rate of 18.2%, and lowered high-risk misclassification severity to 32%, outperforming YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer in robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed robustness framework significantly enhances AVs' perception capabilities against various degradations, demonstrating a practical solution for safer traffic light and sign recognition.

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Smart-GRPO, a method to optimize noise perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models, improving text-to-image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of deterministic flow-matching models for reinforcement learning, which are crucial for enhancing image quality and human alignment.

Method: Smart-GRPO uses an iterative search strategy that decodes noise perturbations, evaluates them through a reward function, and adjusts the noise distribution towards higher-reward outcomes.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance in both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Smart-GRPO provides a practical solution for introducing reinforcement learning into flow-matching frameworks, enabling efficient and human-aligned text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter, a new technique for surface reconstruction from sparse images, achieves excellent results on DTU and Replica benchmarks using dense Gaussian initialization and multi-view supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing techniques in reconstructing high-quality surfaces from sparse, uncalibrated images due to challenges like poor surface generation and overfitting.

Method: FSFSplatter combines a large Transformer for multi-view encoding, dense Gaussian initialization, and differentiable camera parameters leveraging geometry and depth-aware supervision for robust scene reconstruction.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on popular datasets like DTU and Replica, achieving high-quality surface reconstructions despite sparse input images.

Conclusion: FSFSplatter significantly advances free sparse image surface reconstruction by addressing challenges in view overlap and overfitting with innovative foundational components.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC is a framework for motion synthesis that integrates human intentions and visual cues, enabling versatile and controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in text-driven motion generation, specifically its inability to model human intentions and fine-grained control using language alone.

Method: MoGIC combines multimodal motion generation with visual priors and intention modeling, using a mixture-of-attention mechanism for local alignment between inputs.

Result: The proposed approach shows significant improvements in metrics (e.g., reducing FID by over 30%) and surpasses baseline methods in motion captioning and other tasks.

Conclusion: This approach advances the field of controllable and personalized motion synthesis by integrating intention modeling and visual grounding tools.

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

*Jianing Chen,Zehao Li,Yujun Cai,Hao Jiang,Shuqin Gao,Honglong Zhao,Tianlu Mao,Yucheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a motion-adaptive framework to improve 3D reconstruction quality and efficiency from monocular videos by optimizing control point allocation and using spline-based motion representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with computational demands and static redundancy by allocating control points only based on geometry, neglecting dynamic motion complexity.

Method: The authors leverage motion and semantic priors, align control density with motion complexity using voxelization and scoring, and replace deformation fields with spline-based trajectory parameterization.

Result: Experiments show enhanced reconstruction quality and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses control point mismatch, offering smoother motion representation and optimized system performance for dynamic 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

*Weimin Yuan,Cai Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Net2Net, a hybrid approach combining untrained and pre-trained networks for enhanced real-world noise removal, outperforming traditional and deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with real-world noise complexities, and deep learning approaches require extensive labeled data and may lack generalization.

Method: Introduced Net2Net, combining unsupervised DIP and supervised DRUNet with RED to leverage both handcrafted adaptation and large-scale data learning.

Result: Net2Net demonstrated superior performance in noise removal across diverse real-world scenarios and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid Net2Net approach effectively removes real-world noise by balancing unsupervised and pre-trained network capabilities.

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

*Lanyun Zhu,Deyi Ji,Tianrun Chen,Haiyang Wu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Retrv-R1, a multimodal model for universal retrieval, which achieves high performance through reasoning-based approaches and computational optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the challenges faced when applying reinforcement learning to multimodal retrieval tasks, specifically the inefficiency and suboptimal performance of methods like DeepSeek-R1.

Method: Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module to reduce computational costs, employs a details inspection mechanism to preserve critical data, and utilizes a new training paradigm involving a synthetic dataset and curriculum-based reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Retrv-R1 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, higher efficiency, and strong generalization across various retrieval benchmarks and tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that using reasoning-driven approaches combined with innovative training techniques can significantly enhance multimodal retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

*Lihua Zhou,Mao Ye,Shuaifeng Li,Nianxin Li,Jinlin Wu,Xiatian Zhu,Lei Deng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BCA+, a training-free framework for test-time adaptation in vision-language models to enhance object recognition and detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation of vision-language models under real-world distribution shifts and improve efficiency during test-time adaptation.

Method: BCA+ employs a cache-based approach for adaptive priors and likelihoods, incorporating Bayesian inference without backpropagation.

Result: BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on recognition and detection benchmarks, with high efficiency due to its training-free design.

Conclusion: BCA+ provides an efficient and unified framework for test-time adaptation that corrects both semantic and contextual shortcomings in vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

### [125] [Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02760)
*Matthias Perkonigg,Patrick Rockenschaub,Georg Göbel,Adelheid Wöhrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HGCD-BT, a method combining hierarchical clustering and contrastive learning for brain tumor classification, especially targeting unseen tumor categories. The method achieves notable improvement in accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for brain tumor classification cannot handle patterns of tumor types outside predefined classes. This limitation restricts their utility during surgeries and neglects the hierarchical nature of brain tumor taxonomy.

Method: HGCD-BT integrates contrastive learning with a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss, enabling the categorization of both known and unknown tumor types while reflecting their taxonomic relationships.

Result: HGCD-BT boosts patch-level classification accuracy by +28% compared to state-of-the-art, successfully identifying unseen tumor types and generalizing across imaging modalities.

Conclusion: HGCD-BT proves effective in improving accuracy and generalizability for brain tumor classification, addressing limitations in existing supervised and semi-supervised methods.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes AdaRD-Key, a training-free module for query-driven keyframe sampling in long-form videos, which improves video understanding by maximizing query relevance and frame diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models face challenges in processing long-form videos due to their length and dense information, compounded by the limitations of current keyframe selection approaches like rigid temporal spacing or overemphasis on visual diversity.

Method: The paper introduces AdaRD-Key, which combines a query-conditioned relevance score with a diversity mechanism, shifts to diversity-only sampling for weak query alignment, and does not require training while remaining computationally efficient.

Result: Experiments on the LongVideoBench and Video-MME benchmarks demonstrate AdaRD-Key achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in long-form video understanding.

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key provides a practical and effective solution for query-driven video understanding, compatible with existing vision-language models, and improves efficiency and performance without additional training or supervision.

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) reasoning processes on lateral thinking tasks like rebus puzzles and analyzes their performance and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models exhibit strong performance across many tasks, but their cognitive reasoning processes remain unclear, especially for complex lateral thinking challenges such as rebus puzzles.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 221 rebus puzzles categorized into six cognitive groupings and developed an evaluation framework separating reasoning quality from answer correctness. They tested three prompting strategies to analyze different explanatory processes in VLMs.

Result: VLMs performed inconsistently across puzzle types, excelling in visual composition but struggling with absence interpretation and cultural symbolism. Prompting strategies significantly influenced reasoning quality and problem-solving efficacy.

Conclusion: Explainability should be regarded as an integral part of model performance evaluation, as reasoning quality and cognitive processes are critical for understanding model capabilities beyond just answer correctness.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new benchmark dataset for text removal in computer vision, addressing limitations in existing datasets used for scene text removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for text removal suffer from issues like manual editing artifacts, simplistic backgrounds, and poor evaluation metrics, which hinder the ability to generalize or accurately assess methods.

Method: The authors propose a synthesized benchmark dataset featuring text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and vision-language models, ensuring high-quality ground truth and challenging scenarios.

Result: The result is the introduction of a new dataset that is applicable beyond scene text removal and offers more rigorous evaluation standards.

Conclusion: The newly introduced dataset aims to improve the evaluation and generalizability of text removal methods, with the dataset openly available to the community.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multimodal medical object detection by aligning query representations of DETR-style detectors using modalities and context-aware embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the issue of heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces in multimodal medical data for object detection.

Method: Introduces modality tokens and a Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA) mechanism, alongside QueryREPA pretraining to align query representations using a contrastive objective.

Result: Demonstrates consistent AP improvement in multimodal tasks with minimal computation overhead and no architectural changes.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical and efficient framework for robust multimodality medical object detection.

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

*Jingyuan Deng,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) by introducing a new method called Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD), which demonstrably mitigates the issue without compromising general performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of hallucinations in LVLMs, where the generated content contradicts the input visuals and text, and to improve upon existing methods like contrastive decoding and attention manipulation, which have their own limitations.

Method: Propose the MaskCD method that masks "image heads" in LVLMs to create contrastive samples for more effective contrastive decoding.

Result: MaskCD was evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b using benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER, and MME. Results showed it significantly reduces hallucinations while preserving the model's overall capabilities.

Conclusion: MaskCD offers a stable and practical solution for reducing hallucinations in LVLMs, improving their accuracy on multimodal tasks without degrading their performance.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VERNIER, an open-source software for high-precision pose estimation using pseudo-periodic patterns, targeting applications requiring nanometric resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate six degrees of freedom pose estimation at small scales remains challenging, particularly when high resolution and robustness are needed over large ranges for microscopy applications.

Method: VERNIER uses phase-based local thresholding on pseudo-periodic patterns, making it resistant to noise, defocus, and occlusion. The paper details the phase processing steps and pattern selection based on the application's performance needs.

Result: The software demonstrates reliable and fast pose measurements in both synthetic and experimental conditions, achieving nanometer-level resolution.

Conclusion: VERNIER is a robust, versatile, and open-source solution for high-precision pose estimation in microscopy, with practical recommendations for pattern design and microscope setup.

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a

*Feng Yuan,Yifan Gao,Yuehua Ye,Haoyue Li,Xin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Med-K2N, a method for generating multi-modal medical images from K available modalities to N target modalities, addressing challenges like modality contribution, fusion quality, and identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address clinical needs for flexible medical image modality reconstruction to enhance diagnostic capabilities, focusing on reconstructing missing modalities from existing ones.

Method: Med-K2N uses sequential modeling inspired by SAM2's paradigm and clinician workflows. It includes PreWeightNet for assessing global contribution, ThresholdNet for filtering noise, EffiWeightNet for computing weights, and CMIM to ensure modality identity consistency via causal constraints.

Result: The proposed Med-K2N system significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-modal medical image generation.

Conclusion: Med-K2N offers a robust solution for accurate and quality-controlled generation of multi-modal medical images, addressing key challenges in medical image synthesis research.

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

*Md Zahim Hassan,Md. Osama,Muhammad Ashad Kabir,Md. Saiful Islam,Zannatul Naim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, a machine learning framework using external attributes like image, shape, and weight for non-invasive egg quality assessment, achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, non-invasive egg quality assessment is crucial for food safety and operational efficiency in poultry production, driving the need for innovative techniques.

Method: The framework integrates features from pre-trained CNN models (e.g., ResNet152, DenseNet169) along with structural attributes like shape and weight, uses PCA for dimensionality reduction, SMOTE for augmentation, and ensemble voting for classification.

Result: The multimodal ensemble approach significantly outperformed baseline methods, achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction.

Conclusion: Machine learning can effectively assess egg quality using external attributes, providing a transparent, reproducible, and public dataset for further research in non-invasive food quality assessment.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kenshin-Keeps/Egg_Quality_Prediction_ELMF4EggQ, promoting

*Bing Li,Jiaxin Chen,Dongming Zhang,Xiuguo Bao,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MEACI-Net, a novel framework for compressed video action recognition, improving computational efficiency and recognition accuracy through enhanced motion representation and cross-modal interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in compressed video action recognition, including coarse and noisy dynamics and insufficient fusion between RGB and motion cues.

Method: MEACI-Net employs a two-stream architecture with enhanced motion representation using a multi-scale block and denoising module, combined with selective fusion techniques (SMC and CMA) to improve cross-modal integration.

Result: Experiments conducted on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-400 datasets show MEACI-Net's effectiveness and efficiency in recognizing actions from compressed videos.

Conclusion: MEACI-Net provides a promising solution for improving compressed video action recognition by enhancing motion representation and utilizing advanced cross-modal interaction techniques.

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces \frameworkName{}, a zero-shot captioning framework that uses a patch-centric approach, allowing for region-level image captioning without region-specific supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current zero-shot captioning models, which focus only on whole-image captions using global representations, by creating a framework capable of generating captions for arbitrary regions.

Method: The approach shifts from an image-based methodology to a patch-focused paradigm, treating individual image patches as fundamental captioning units and aggregating them for scalable region-based captions.

Result: Experiments show that using backbones like DINO improves visual feature quality, leading to superior zero-shot dense, region-set, and trace captioning performance compared to current methods.

Conclusion: Patch-wise semantic representations enable scalable and high-performance zero-shot captioning, advancing the area of dense and region-specific caption generation.

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

*Laith Nayal,Hadi Salloum,Ahmad Taha,Yaroslav Kholodov,Alexander Gasnikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores semantic segmentation models' ability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions using fine-tuned foundation models, proposing a method with no additional training that surpasses existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the underexplored area of detecting OoD regions in semantic segmentation tasks using foundation models, enabling safer autonomous driving systems.

Method: They utilize the InternImage backbone features, applying K-Means clustering and confidence thresholding on decoder logits without requiring further training.

Result: The method achieves high Average Precision scores of 50.02 on RoadAnomaly and 48.77 on ADE-OoD benchmarks, outperforming both supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free approach demonstrates that fine-tuned foundation models can effectively distinguish OoD regions, presenting a minimalist yet effective direction for future research.

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

### [137] [Don't Just Chase "Highlighted Tokens" in MLLMs: Revisiting Visual Holistic Context Retention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02912)
*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoloV, a new visual token pruning framework for MLLMs, aimed at reducing computational overhead by retaining tokens representing global visual context. It outperforms existing methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from computational inefficiencies due to excessive visual tokens, and existing pruning methods underperform at high pruning ratios.

Method: HoloV avoids attention-first pruning and adaptively distributes pruning across spatial crops, ensuring the retention of tokens capturing global visual context.

Result: HoloV delivers better performance across tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, when pruning 88.9% of tokens in LLaVA1.5, it retains 95.8% of performance.

Conclusion: HoloV offers a superior framework for efficient inference in MLLMs by addressing representational collapse and maintaining task-relevant features, even under high pruning ratios.

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance the robustness of vision-language models like CLIP against adversarial attacks while maintaining generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models, despite their impressive zero-shot generalization abilities, are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, necessitating methods to improve robustness without affecting generalization.

Method: CAW comprises a Confidence-Aware loss that scales KL divergence for uncertain examples, and feature alignment regularization to ensure semantic consistency by minimizing feature distance between frozen and fine-tuned encoders.

Result: Through experiments on TinyImageNet and 14 datasets, CAW demonstrates superior robustness and performance compared to approaches like PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR, particularly under strong adversarial attacks such as AutoAttack.

Conclusion: CAW successfully improves accuracy (both clean and robust) without sacrificing zero-shot generalization, offering memory-efficient robustness against adversarial attacks in vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: This study investigates large vision-language models (LVLMs) for assessing carotid plaque risks by combining imaging and clinical data. A custom model adaptation boosts performance but highlights existing limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately assessing carotid atheromatous disease risks remains a challenge due to the need to integrate diverse clinical and imaging data in a clear and interpretable manner for clinicians.

Method: The study evaluates LVLMs for integrating ultrasound imaging with clinical data through diagnostic simulation and adapts a model, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna, to the ultrasound domain using LoRA adaptation. Multimodal data integration via text is explored.

Result: Zero-shot experiments reveal many LVLMs underperform in imaging recognition and risk classification. However, adapting LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna improves stroke risk predictions and surpasses prior CNN baselines.

Conclusion: LVLMs show promise for ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction but require multimodal integration, model calibration, and domain adaptation for clinical usefulness.

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the FDA-VAE model for multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI synthesis, effectively separating features, reducing model complexity, and improving synthesis quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and lack of interpretability in existing deep autoencoder-based methods for multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI synthesis.

Method: FDA-VAE, a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model, uses symmetric latent distributions and a Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy for feature separation.

Result: FDA-VAE outperforms existing methods by reducing model parameters, lowering inference time, and enhancing synthesis quality.

Conclusion: FDA-VAE proves to be more efficient, interpretable, and effective for the task of multi-phase CE MRI synthesis, marking it a significant improvement over previous methods.

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LPG-Bench, a benchmarking framework for evaluating the performance of text-to-image (T2I) models on long and detailed prompts, highlighting shortcomings of existing metrics, and proposes a new metric TIT for improved alignment evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images for short prompts but struggle with long and detailed prompts, necessitating tools for effective evaluation and improvement.

Method: LPG-Bench provides 200 long prompts for rigorous benchmarking across 13 T2I models, combined with human annotations. A novel metric, TIT-Score and its variant TIT-Score-LLM are introduced to better align evaluations with human judgment through text-to-image-to-text consistency.

Result: The TIT framework shows superior alignment with human preferences, outperforming existing metrics like CLIP-score, with TIT-Score-LLM achieving a 7.31% improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest alternative.

Conclusion: LPG-Bench and TIT enrich the evaluation landscape for T2I models, promoting advancements in handling long-prompt challenges with open-access resources and improved metrics.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper provides advancements in 3D editing by introducing a new dataset 3DEditVerse and a transformer-based model 3DEditFormer, enabling precise, consistent, and scalable 3D modifications without the need for manual masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of 3D editing (e.g., cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and control), which are more complex than 2D editing and often require impractical manual interventions.

Method: The paper introduces a dataset, 3DEditVerse, for benchmarking paired 3D edits and proposes 3DEditFormer, a 3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating for disentangling editable and preserved regions.

Result: Their proposed 3DEditFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on 3DEditVerse.

Conclusion: The framework addresses key challenges in 3D editing, enabling practical and scalable solutions, and sets a new standard in the field.

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

*Sara Mobsite,Renaud Hostache,Laure Berti Equille,Emmanuel Roux,Joris Guerin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in land cover semantic segmentation using satellite imagery affected by cloud cover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud-obstructed optical imagery limits land cover mapping in tropical areas, necessitating better approaches that use radar data and optimize deep learning models.

Method: The paper introduces a cloud injection algorithm to simulate cloud cover, explores Sentinel-1 radar data use, and proposes a method to inject NDIs into decoding layers to retain spatial features.

Result: Performance improvements were observed in segmentation tasks, with U-Net gaining 1.99% and DeepLabV3 gaining 2.78% accuracy in cloud-free imagery, and further gains seen with radar-optical fusion under cloud conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance land cover segmentation performance and demonstrate the potential of Sentinel-1 radar data in challenging atmospheric conditions.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

TL;DR: PocketSR is a lightweight solution for RealSR, using innovative designs to achieve high-quality image enhancement efficiently and rapidly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RealSR methods using large generative models are computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for edge deployment. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing a more efficient yet high-fidelity approach.

Method: PocketSR employs LiteED, a streamlined version of VAE, and online annealing pruning combined with multi-layer feature distillation loss to optimize and preserve generative modeling abilities.

Result: PocketSR achieves a model size of 146M parameters, processes 4K images in 0.8 seconds, and matches state-of-the-art performance for RealSR methods, both single-step and multi-step.

Conclusion: The proposed PocketSR model offers a practical, ultra-efficient solution for RealSR with high-quality results, ideal for edge-device deployment.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Method: The study introduces MEve, a curated prompt suite, and analyzes two model families, OpenSora and CogVideoX, with systematic experiments focusing on early intervention techniques.

Result: Early intervention in denoising steps and specific model layers was found to be pivotal for achieving coherent multi-event video generation.

Conclusion: The findings highlight key factors for multi-event video generation and open pathways for improved multi-event conditioning in T2V models.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event
conditioning in future models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents InsideOut, a FER framework using EfficientNetV2-S combined with strategies like transfer learning and imbalance-aware optimization to improve emotion recognition on FER2013.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in Facial Emotion Recognition (FER), such as occlusions, variations in pose and illumination, subtle differences among emotions, and dataset imbalances.

Method: The paper employs a FER framework utilizing EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, stratified dataset splitting, and class-weighted loss to handle imbalanced datasets.

Result: The proposed method achieves 62.8% accuracy and a macro F1 score of 0.590 on the FER2013 dataset, performing competitively against conventional CNN baselines.

Conclusion: Efficient architectures, paired with targeted imbalance handling techniques, can achieve reproducible, effective FER solutions suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

### [147] [Geometry Meets Vision: Revisiting Pretrained Semantics in Distilled Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03104)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the utility of geometry-grounded versus visual-only semantic features in radiance fields, focusing on their impact on spatial tasks like pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to explore whether geometry-grounded semantic features provide better geometry-aware detail and spatial task performance in contexts like manipulation and navigation.

Method: The study approaches the problem via three critical questions about fidelity, object localization, and inversion accuracy. It also presents a new SPINE framework for radiance field inversion.

Result: Geometry-grounded features exhibit finer structural details but do not enhance semantic object localization and surprisingly decrease pose estimation accuracy compared to visual-only features.

Conclusion: Visual-only features are more versatile for downstream tasks, but further research on improving the utility of geometry-grounded features is necessary.

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

*Karim Farid,Rajat Sahay,Yumna Ali Alnaggar,Simon Schrodi,Volker Fischer,Cordelia Schmid,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates how design choices impact compositional generalization in generative visual models, identifying key factors and proposing improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional generalization is crucial for visual generative models, but its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.

Method: Controlled experiments were conducted to test the impact of discrete versus continuous training objectives and conditioning information on compositional generalization.

Result: Two factors influencing performance were identified: discrete vs. continuous training objectives and information during conditioning. Relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective improves performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances compositional performance by integrating discrete and continuous training elements into visual generative models.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

### [149] [Mask2IV: Interaction-Centric Video Generation via Mask Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03135)
*Gen Li,Bo Zhao,Jianfei Yang,Laura Sevilla-Lara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask2IV presents a novel interaction-centric video generation framework that uses trajectory predictions instead of dense mask annotations, offering superior realism and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with dynamic and complex human-object or robot-object interactions, and obtaining dense mask annotations is impractical.

Method: Mask2IV employs a two-stage pipeline: first predicting plausible motion trajectories for actor and object, then generating interaction-centric videos based on these trajectories.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Mask2IV outperforms baselines in visual realism and controllability, validated with benchmarks for human and robotic interactions.

Conclusion: Mask2IV provides intuitive control mechanisms and eliminates the need for dense mask inputs, representing a significant improvement in interaction-centric video generation.

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

*Naresh Kumar Devulapally,Shruti Agarwal,Tejas Gokhale,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel technique for creating unlearnable samples to counter unauthorized model use, providing both improved visual fidelity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns of data privacy, intellectual property misuse, and unauthorized usage in text-to-image diffusion models through robust defenses.

Method: Developed a latent-space perturbation strategy that leverages trajectory-shifted sampling within Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), maintaining visual fidelity while enhancing unlearnability.

Result: Significant improvements in imperceptibility (8%-10% on PSNR, SSIM, FID) and robustness (10% across five adversarial scenarios) were achieved.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully safeguards against unauthorized usage and model inversion while maintaining high image quality, proving practical for defense in generative models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

### [151] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete is a novel framework for image completion that uses explicit 3D geometric guidance to restore missing regions in target images, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing generative methods for reference-driven image completion, which often fail to produce geometrically consistent, realistic results when significant differences exist between target and reference views.

Method: GeoComplete employs a novel dual-branch diffusion architecture that leverages explicit 3D structural guidance, projected point clouds, and target-aware masking to enforce geometric consistency and enhance image completion.

Result: GeoComplete outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 17.1 PSNR improvement, delivering higher geometric accuracy and visual quality in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: By integrating 3D structural guidance and innovative masking strategies, GeoComplete successfully enforces geometric consistency in image completion, representing a robust solution for challenging geometry-conditioned tasks.

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

*Kaisi Guan,Xihua Wang,Zhengfeng Lai,Xin Cheng,Peng Zhang,XiaoJiang Liu,Ruihua Song,Meng Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach for Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, overcoming challenges of modal interference and cross-modal feature interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unresolved challenges in generating synchronized audio-video content from textual input for better alignment with semantic and temporal attributes.

Method: The paper proposes two solutions: Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) for disentangled caption creation and BridgeDiT, a dual-tower diffusion transformer using Dual CrossAttention for cross-modal information exchange.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets and human evaluations show state-of-the-art performance across most metrics, validating the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the core challenges in T2SV and establishes a robust foundation for future studies in this domain, supported by public code and checkpoints.

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HAVIR, a model for reconstructing complex visual stimuli using brain activity data. The model separates structural and semantic features using hierarchical approaches inspired by the visual cortex and integrates them through diffusion mechanisms, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the accuracy in reconstructing complex visual stimuli from brain activity by addressing challenges such as heterogeneity in low-level features and semantic entanglement in high-level features of natural scenes.

Method: HAVIR leverages hierarchical visual cortex representation theory, splitting the visual cortex into structural and semantic regions. Structural information is extracted using a Structural Generator and converted into latent diffusion priors, while semantic information is transformed using a Semantic Extractor into CLIP embeddings. These are merged through the Versatile Diffusion model to reconstruct images.

Result: Experimental results show HAVIR improves structural and semantic aspects of reconstructed images even with complex scenes, outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: The HAVIR model provides an effective way to enhance reconstruction quality in terms of structural and semantic accuracy, presenting a promising direction for integrating neuroscience and computer vision methodologies.

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for accurate modeling of human mobility for applications like urban planning and traffic management.

Method: The authors propose Markovian Reeb Graphs, a probabilistic topological model that integrates individual and population-level mobility structures to simulate Patterns of Life (PoLs).

Result: Through evaluations on the Urban Anomalies dataset, the method demonstrated strong fidelity using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence across metrics while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Markovian Reeb Graphs offer a scalable and versatile solution for simulating trajectories applicable across varied urban contexts.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpineMed, a comprehensive AI ecosystem featuring SpineMed-450k, a multimodal dataset for vertebral-level reasoning, and SpineBench, an evaluation framework for spine disorder diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-assisted diagnosis for spine disorders is constrained by the lack of multimodal, level-aware datasets and standardized benchmarks, despite the global prevalence and significance of these disorders.

Method: The authors developed SpineMed-450k using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM method for data curation, and validated performance on spine-related clinical tasks using SpineBench.

Result: Evaluation of multiple LVLMs revealed weaknesses in fine-grained reasoning, while the model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k showed marked improvements validated by clinical assessments.

Conclusion: SpineMed-450k and SpineBench fill key gaps in spine disorder diagnostics, enabling models to achieve better clinical applicability and diagnostic clarity.

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting and localizing image forgeries in diverse domains through UniShield, a unified multi-agent system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the societal risks posed by realistic synthetic images (e.g., misinformation, fraud) and address existing methods' limitations in cross-domain generalization and adaptability.

Method: UniShield integrates a perception agent for analyzing image features to dynamically select detection models and a detection agent that consolidates domain-specific detectors into a unified framework to deliver interpretable reports.

Result: UniShield demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing domain-specific and unified systems in detection accuracy, adaptability, and scalability.

Conclusion: UniShield effectively overcomes the limitations of current forgery detection systems, offering a robust, scalable, and practical solution for cross-domain image forgery detection and localization.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently generate 3D object models that can adapt to different lighting conditions without requiring complex simulations.

Method: Uses a generative relighting model to create a lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with a dual-branch architecture for general lighting and specular effects.

Result: ROGR improves state-of-the-art performance, as validated on datasets like TensoIR and Stanford-ORB, and works on real-world object captures.

Conclusion: The method offers a significant advancement in relighting 3D models in a computationally efficient manner under arbitrary lighting conditions.

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in interactive 3D segmentation models, which either lack volume awareness or have limited interactive refinement capabilities.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates effective iterative refinement with user prompts, optimizing segmentation tasks in 3D biomedical imaging through computationally efficient training strategies.

Abstract: Interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation requires efficient models that
can iteratively refine predictions based on user prompts. Current foundation
models either lack volumetric awareness or suffer from limited interactive
capabilities. We propose a training strategy that combines dynamic volumetric
prompt generation with content-aware adaptive cropping to optimize the use of
the image encoder. Our method simulates realistic user interaction patterns
during training while addressing the computational challenges of learning from
sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU. For efficient training, we
initialize our network using the publicly available weights from the
nnInteractive segmentation model. Evaluation on the \textbf{Foundation Models

strong performance with an average final Dice score of 0.6385, normalized

TL;DR: PQGAN integrates Product Quantisation (PQ) into the VQGAN framework, significantly improving reconstruction performance and enabling better image generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing quantisation methods and latent representation techniques in high-fidelity image generation.

Method: The authors introduce PQGAN, leveraging product quantisation within an autoencoder architecture. They perform a detailed analysis of codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation.

Result: PQGAN achieves superior performance metrics: PSNR of 37dB (vs. 27dB in prior work) and reduces FID, LPIPS, and CMMD by up to 96%. It offers faster, efficient, and high-resolution generation.

Conclusion: Product quantisation, via PQGAN, offers a promising extension to discrete latent representation, demonstrating advantages for practical usage in image synthesis applications.

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

TL;DR: Memory Forcing is a learning framework for autoregressive video diffusion models in Minecraft gameplay, addressing the trade-off between new scene generation and spatial consistency during revisits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of video diffusion models in scenarios like Minecraft gameplay by addressing challenges in balancing scene exploration quality and spatial consistency under computational constraints.

Method: The framework combines Hybrid Training to manage gameplay regimes, Chained Forward Training for consistent rollouts, and techniques like Point-to-Frame Retrieval and Incremental 3D Reconstruction to enhance spatial memory usage during simulations.

Result: The experiments show Memory Forcing significantly boosts long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across different environments while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Memory Forcing offers a novel solution for balancing exploration and revisits in video diffusion models, enhancing fidelity in simulational tasks like Minecraft gameplay.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

*Luca Collorone,Matteo Gioia,Massimiliano Pappa,Paolo Leoni,Giovanni Ficarra,Or Litany,Indro Spinelli,Fabio Galasso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonSTeR establishes an innovative framework to align human skeletal motion, intentions described in text, and environmental context through a unified latent space for cross-modal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks effective methods to evaluate and align human motion, intention, and environmental context, hindering advancements in tasks requiring synchronized multimodal understanding.

Method: MonSTeR uses unimodal and cross-modal representations to construct a unified latent space, capturing interdependencies between motion, text, and scene. This framework is validated through various tasks and comparative studies.

Result: The model outperforms existing trimodal systems, achieves strong alignment with human preferences in a user study, and demonstrates adaptability in tasks like zero-shot object placement and motion captioning.

Conclusion: MonSTeR is a robust tool for cross-modal retrieval in human motion analysis, emphasizing its flexibility and potential applications in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

*Dong Lao,Yuxiang Zhang,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Yangchao Wu,Alex Wong,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an innovative defense mechanism against adversarial attacks using stochastic resonance to enhance robustness with minimal information loss, achieving state-of-the-art results across various tasks without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a robust test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks that is training-free, architecture-agnostic, and avoids information loss.

Method: Introduce small translational perturbations to input images, align transformed feature embeddings, and aggregate them using a closed-form formula, applicable to various networks without retraining.

Result: Achieved up to 68.1% recovery of accuracy loss in image classification, 71.9% in stereo matching, and 29.2% in optical flow tasks under adversarial attack scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness as a generic, practical, and versatile defense mechanism for diverse vision tasks against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

*Ricardo T. Fares,Lucas C. Ribas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixer, a new randomized neural network for texture recognition, leveraging hyperspherical embeddings and a dual-branch module to improve representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing randomized neural networks achieve good results in texture recognition but lack advancements in their overall architecture.

Method: Mixer employs hyperspherical random embeddings combined with a dual-branch learning module and formulates a new optimization problem for enhanced texture representation.

Result: The proposed Mixer demonstrates promising performance across various texture benchmarks with differing challenges.

Conclusion: Mixer introduces a novel neural architecture which significantly improves texture representation, advancing the capabilities of randomized networks in this domain.

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

### [164] [Improving GUI Grounding with Explicit Position-to-Coordinate Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03230)
*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the difficulty of GUI grounding in high-resolution settings by introducing explicit positional markers (RULER tokens) and an improved positional encoding scheme (I-MRoPE), resulting in higher grounding accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the ability of autonomous agents to map natural-language instructions to pixel coordinates reliably, especially in high-resolution GUI settings where current Visual Language Models face challenges.

Method: The paper introduces RULER tokens for explicit coordinate marking and Interleaved MRoPE for balanced spatial encoding, mitigating issues in position-to-pixel mapping.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets (ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro) show that their method consistently improves grounding accuracy, particularly in high-resolution interfaces.

Conclusion: The proposed explicit spatial guidance method enables reliable GUI automation across various resolutions and platforms.

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework for out-of-distribution tasks in domains like medical imaging, leveraging limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with out-of-distribution tasks in specialized domains like medical imaging due to limited and expensive labeled data.

Method: LEAML uses a QA generator regularized by caption distillation to create domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs from unlabeled data and selectively updates neurons crucial for question-answering to efficiently gain domain-specific knowledge.

Result: LEAML demonstrates consistent superior performance to standard fine-tuning in minimal supervision settings across gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA tasks.

Conclusion: The LEAML framework is effective in adapting MLLMs to specialized domains with minimal supervision, offering a promising solution for label-scarce environments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

### [166] [ElasticMoE: An Efficient Auto Scaling Method for Mixture-of-Experts Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02613)
*Gursimran Singh,Timothy Yu,Haley Li,Cheng Chen,Hanieh Sadri,Qintao Zhang,Yu Zhang,Ying Xiong,Yong Zhang,Zhenan Fan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ElasticMoE is a new framework that makes scaling Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models more efficient and practical for dynamic cloud environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling MoE large language models efficiently has been a challenge due to issues like coarse scaling granularity, overprovisioning, and downtime during traffic bursts in cloud deployments.

Method: ElasticMoE introduces fine-grained, concurrent scaling by separating inference and memory operations, and using techniques like zero-copy remapping, peer-to-peer weight transfers, and virtual memory expert migration.

Result: The proposed system significantly reduces scale-up latency (up to 9x faster), doubles throughput during scaling, and improves service level objective (SLO) attainment compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ElasticMoE makes the deployment of large MoE language models in dynamic cloud settings more feasible by addressing scaling inefficiencies and downtime issues.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models promise efficient scaling of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of experts per token, but their
parallelized inference pipelines make elastic serving challenging. Existing
strategies fall short: horizontal scaling provisions entire replicas of the
current configuration, often tens to hundreds of accelerators, leading to
coarse granularity, long provisioning delays, and costly overprovisioning.
Vertical scaling offers finer adjustments but typically requires instance
restarts, incurring downtime. These limitations make current approaches
ill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud
deployments.
  We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that
achieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling. ElasticMoE
decouples inference execution from memory operations, enabling scaling steps to
proceed concurrently with serving. An HBM Management Module (HMM) reuses
weights and KV caches via zero-copy remapping, while high-bandwidth
peer-to-peer transfers bring newly added accelerators online without
interrupting service. A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism
migrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory
usage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.
  Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that
ElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput
during scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to
baselines. By enabling fine-grained, concurrent scaling with minimal
disruption, ElasticMoE advances the practicality of deploying massive MoE LLMs
in dynamic cloud environments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRNND, a GPU-parallel algorithm to enhance the efficiency of RNN-Descent for constructing sparse ANN graphs, achieving substantial speedups over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scalability challenges of the RNN-Descent algorithm in constructing approximate nearest neighbor graphs as data size and dimensionality increase.

Method: Introduce GRNND with GPU-parallel execution, employing disordered neighbor propagation, warp-level cooperative operations, and advanced memory management techniques.

Result: GRNND significantly outperforms existing GPU- and CPU-based methods, delivering speedups ranging from 2.4 to 51.7x over GPU methods and 17.8 to 49.8x over CPU methods.

Conclusion: GRNND effectively addresses computational bottlenecks of RNN-Descent, showcasing its potential for large-scale and high-dimensional nearest neighbor graph construction.

Abstract: Relative Nearest Neighbor Descent (RNN-Descent) is a state-of-the-art
algorithm for constructing sparse approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) graphs by
combining the iterative refinement of NN-Descent with the edge-pruning rules of
the Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG). It has demonstrated strong effectiveness
in large-scale search tasks such as information retrieval and related tasks.
However, as the amount and dimensionality of data increase, the complexity of
graph construction in RNN-Descent rises sharply, making this stage increasingly
time-consuming and even prohibitive for subsequent query processing. In this
paper, we propose GRNND, the first GPU-parallel algorithm of RNN-Descent
designed to fully exploit GPU architecture. GRNND introduces a disordered
neighbor propagation strategy to mitigate synchronized update traps, enhancing
structural diversity, and avoiding premature convergence during parallel
execution. It also leverages warp-level cooperative operations and a
double-buffered neighbor pool with fixed capacity for efficient memory access,
eliminate contention, and enable highly parallelized neighbor updates.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRNND consistently outperforms existing
CPU- and GPU-based methods. GRNND achieves 2.4 to 51.7x speedup over existing
GPU methods, and 17.8 to 49.8x speedup over CPU methods.

*Yifei Xia,Fangcheng Fu,Hao Yuan,Hanke Zhang,Xupeng Miao,Yijun Liu,Suhan Ling,Jie Jiang,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces TridentServe, a dynamic serving system that optimizes resource allocation for diffusion pipelines, achieving significant efficiency gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current serving systems for diffusion pipelines allocate resources inefficiently due to fixed, manual paradigms, resulting in mismatched resource needs across stages and requests.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic stage-level serving paradigm and develop TridentServe, which automates placement and dispatch plans for pipeline deployment and request processing, co-optimizing resource allocation.

Result: TridentServe demonstrates improvements in SLO attainment and reduces average and P95 latencies by up to 2.5x and 3.6x/4.1x across diverse workloads, outperforming existing systems.

Conclusion: The proposed TridentServe system transforms how diffusion pipelines are served by dynamically optimizing their resource allocation, significantly improving performance and scalability.

Abstract: Diffusion pipelines, renowned for their powerful visual generation
capabilities, have seen widespread adoption in generative vision tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image/video). These pipelines typically follow an
encode--diffuse--decode three-stage architecture. Current serving systems
deploy diffusion pipelines within a static, manual, and pipeline-level
paradigm, allocating the same resources to every request and stage. However,
through an in-depth analysis, we find that such a paradigm is inefficient due
to the discrepancy in resource needs across the three stages of each request,
as well as across different requests. Following the analysis, we propose the
dynamic stage-level serving paradigm and develop TridentServe, a brand new
diffusion serving system. TridentServe automatically, dynamically derives the
placement plan (i.e., how each stage resides) for pipeline deployment and the
dispatch plan (i.e., how the requests are routed) for request processing,
co-optimizing the resource allocation for both model and requests. Extensive
experiments show that TridentServe consistently improves SLO attainment and
reduces average/P95 latencies by up to 2.5x and 3.6x/4.1x over existing works
across a variety of workloads.

Motivation: Address the need for energy efficiency in large-scale computation systems powered by GPUs, while maximizing performance and scalability in solving sparse linear systems.

Method: Develop methods to optimize the library's multi-GPU usage, implement energy measurement tools, and assess performance and energy efficiency against benchmarks.

Result: Optimization proves to reduce runtime energy consumption and time-to-solution, providing significant advantages over comparable frameworks in terms of efficiency.

Conclusion: Multi-GPU optimization strategies significantly improve energy efficiency and performance, contributing to sustainable HPC solutions.

Abstract: We investigate the energy efficiency of a library designed for parallel
computations with sparse matrices. The library leverages high-performance,
energy-efficient Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators to enable
large-scale scientific applications. Our primary development objective was to
maximize parallel performance and scalability in solving sparse linear systems
whose dimensions far exceed the memory capacity of a single node. To this end,
we devised methods that expose a high degree of parallelism while optimizing
algorithmic implementations for efficient multi-GPU usage. Previous work has
already demonstrated the library's performance efficiency on large-scale
systems comprising thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, achieving improvements over
state-of-the-art solutions. In this paper, we extend those results by providing
energy profiles that address the growing sustainability requirements of modern
HPC platforms. We present our methodology and tools for accurate runtime energy
measurements of the library's core components and discuss the findings. Our
results confirm that optimizing GPU computations and minimizing data movement
across memory and computing nodes reduces both time-to-solution and energy
consumption. Moreover, we show that the library delivers substantial advantages
over comparable software frameworks on standard benchmarks.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper highlights energy inefficiency in cloud-based Earth Observation big data processing and proposes research directions for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the growing concerns over energy costs and carbon footprint associated with cloud-based processing of large Earth Observation datasets.

Method: The authors analyze current Earth Observation big data processing practices, examine successful energy efficiency strategies in other domains, and identify gaps in energy efficiency within existing frameworks.

Result: The study identifies critical gaps such as insufficient energy monitoring, inadequate data management for energy awareness, and poor implementation of energy-efficient practices.

Conclusion: The paper suggests developing energy-aware monitoring frameworks, optimizing infrastructure orchestration, and implementing energy-efficient task scheduling to reduce environmental impact.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data volumes are rapidly increasing. While cloud
computing are now used for processing large EO datasets, the energy efficiency
aspects of such a processing have received much less attention. This issue is
notable given the increasing awareness of energy costs and carbon footprint in
big data processing, particularly with increased attention on compute-intensive
foundation models. In this paper we identify gaps in energy efficiency
practices within cloud-based EO big data (EOBD) processing and propose several
research directions for improvement. We first examine the current EOBD
landscape, focus on the requirements that necessitate cloud-based processing
and analyze existing cloud-based EOBD solutions. We then investigate energy
efficiency strategies that have been successfully employed in well-studied big
data domains. Through this analysis, we identify several critical gaps in
existing EOBD processing platforms, which primarily focus on data accessibility
and computational feasibility, instead of energy efficiency. These gaps include
insufficient energy monitoring mechanisms, lack of energy awareness in data
management, inadequate implementation of energy-aware resource allocation and
lack of energy efficiency criteria on task scheduling. Based on these findings,
we propose the development of energy-aware performance monitoring and
benchmarking frameworks, the use of optimization techniques for infrastructure
orchestration, and of energy-efficient task scheduling approaches for
distributed cloud-based EOBD processing frameworks. These proposed approaches
aim to foster more energy awareness in EOBD processing , potentially reducing
power consumption and environmental impact while maintaining or minimally
impacting processing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in extreme value forecasting, particularly in imbalanced datasets, by integrating data augmentation techniques with deep learning models.

Method: The study uses GANs and SMOTE for data augmentation and employs Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM networks for forecasting. A novel strategy considers relevance functions tailored for extreme values.

Result: SMOTE demonstrates superior adaptability, leading to enhanced forecasting performance. Conv-LSTM performs better on stable datasets, while BD-LSTM excels on chaotic ones.

Conclusion: Combining SMOTE and deep learning models effectively improves extreme value forecasting, offering complementary strengths depending on dataset characteristics.

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

Result: The OpenTSLM models outperformed baselines on new benchmarks like HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT, achieving notable improvements in text-time-series reasoning tasks. Flamingo model displayed superior performance on longer sequences with better memory efficiency.

Conclusion: OpenTSLM proves to be a robust family of models for reasoning over time-series data. Its open-source code, datasets, and models will drive further innovation in time-series reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

### [175] [RainSeer: Fine-Grained Rainfall Reconstruction via Physics-Guided Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02414)
*Lin Chen,Jun Chen,Minghui Qiu,Shuxin Zhong,Binghong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer proposes a method to improve rainfall field reconstruction using radar reflectivity as a structural prior, and demonstrates significant accuracy improvements compared to prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields often fail to capture sharp transitions and localized extremes, which limits their utility for applications like flood forecasting and hydrological modeling.

Method: RainSeer introduces a two-stage architecture: (i) a Structure-to-Point Mapper for spatial alignment of radar data to ground-level rainfall,and (ii) a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder using spatiotemporal attention to account for descent, melting, and evaporation of hydro-meteors.

Result: RainSeer showed over a 13.31% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to existing approaches and enhanced structural fidelity in rainfall reconstructions across datasets from Korea (RAIN-F) and France (MeteoNet).

Conclusion: RainSeer successfully addresses key challenges in rainfall field reconstruction and demonstrates clear advantages, making it a promising tool for hydrological analysis and flood forecasting.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

### [176] [How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02453)
*Parth Asawa,Alan Zhu,Matei Zaharia,Alexandros G. Dimakis,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Advisor Models, trained via reinforcement learning, as a dynamic interface to optimize black-box foundation models' behavior, outperforming static prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box foundation models rely heavily on static prompts, which are inflexible and fail to adapt to varying inputs, users, or scenarios.

Method: The researchers propose Advisor Models, small parametric policies trained with reinforcement learning, to generate dynamic, instance-specific natural language instructions to steer black-box models, leveraging environmental rewards.

Result: Advisor Models outperform static prompt optimization across various domains, show generalizability across black-box models, and maintain robustness to out-of-distribution inputs.

Conclusion: Advisor Models enable dynamic, personalized, and environment-adaptable optimization of black-box foundation models, presenting a promising method to achieve adaptive AI capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

### [177] [In-memory Training on Analog Devices with Limited Conductance States via Multi-tile Residual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02516)
*Jindan Li,Zhaoxian Wu,Gaowen Liu,Tayfun Gokmen,Tianyi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a residual learning framework to improve training accuracy in analog in-memory computing (AIMC) systems with low-precision (e.g., 4-bit resolution) resistive memory devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analog in-memory accelerators face challenges in achieving high training accuracy with limited-state (low precision) memory devices due to fabrication constraints and increased complexity of noise mitigation techniques.

Method: The authors propose a residual learning framework where multiple crossbar tiles sequentially compute to compensate for errors caused by low-precision weight updates. They also provide a theoretical analysis showing its effectiveness and convergence properties.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art AIMC training approaches under limited-state constraints in standard image classification tasks, maintaining effectiveness while only inducing moderate hardware overhead.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient on-chip training for low-precision memory devices by mitigating precision limitations, thereby bridging the performance gap and making AIMC accelerators more practical.

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

*Ashish Jha,Valentin Leplat,AH Phan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for selecting a minimal yet effective subset of training data using a market-based approach, combining heterogeneous utility signals with clear interpretability and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of selecting a small but effective subset of training data, given the complexity of combining diverse utility signals (like uncertainty, diversity, and rarity) in a systematic and principled way.

Method: The paper proposes a market-based selector where utility signals serve as traders and the example prices are determined using an LMSR (logarithmic market scoring rule) cost-function prediction market. It includes topic-wise normalization to ensure calibration, parameters for length bias handling, and a diversity head to enhance coverage.

Result: Empirical results on datasets like GSM8K and AGNews show that the proposed market-based method matches or outperforms single-signal baselines, achieving competitive accuracy, improved stability, and balanced selections while maintaining low computational overhead.

Conclusion: The framework unifies multi-signal data curation under fixed compute settings, offering interpretable and lightweight mechanisms to improve training data utility selection for tasks involving reasoning and classification.

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

### [179] [Assessing the Potential for Catastrophic Failure in Dynamic Post-Training Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02457)
*Logan Frank,Paul Ardis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates catastrophic performance drops in post-training quantization (PTQ) of neural networks and introduces methods to identify and analyze vulnerable cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address potential catastrophic performance drops when neural networks are subjected to dynamic post-training quantization, particularly in safety-critical environments.

Method: The authors use a combination of knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning to learn a network and bit-width policy pair, enabling them to identify and analyze the worst-case scenarios for performance failure.

Result: The study confirms the existence of vulnerable network-policy pairs with performance reductions ranging from 10-65% in some cases, compared to <2% reductions for robust pairs. It also identifies points of highest vulnerability through systematic experiments.

Conclusion: While representing an initial step, the work highlights the need for rigorous evaluations of robustness and safety considerations in deploying PTQ in real-world applications. It calls for further exploration into failure scenarios to ensure trustworthy deployment.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

*Ashish Jha,Salman Ahmadi-Asl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAGE is a memory-efficient subset selection method for neural network training, using Frequent Directions sketches to optimize training data selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational and energy demands of training modern neural networks on large datasets call for efficient training methods.

Method: SAGE uses Frequent Directions sketches to create a compact representation of gradient geometry and selects training examples aligning with consensus directions. It avoids pairwise similarity computations and uses a two-pass GPU-friendly pipeline.

Result: SAGE achieves competitive accuracy with reduced compute and memory requirements across benchmarks, outperforming baseline selection methods in efficiency.

Conclusion: SAGE provides a practical, constant-memory streaming alternative for efficient neural network training, complementing pruning and model compression techniques.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

### [181] [Uncertainty-Guided Model Selection for Tabular Foundation Models in Biomolecule Efficacy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02476)
*Jie Li,Andrew McCarthy,Zhizhuo Zhang,Stephen Young*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores an uncertainty-driven model selection strategy to improve biomolecule efficacy prediction using the TabPFN model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the challenge in leveraging in-context learning for biomolecule efficacy prediction, particularly addressing sensitivity issues to contexts and the lack of ground truth labels for ensemble optimization.

Method: The authors used a TabPFN model with sequence-based features and an uncertainty-guided strategy—involving the predicted inter-quantile range (IQR)—to select models for ensemble creation without ground truth labels.

Result: The TabPFN model outperformed specialized state-of-the-art predictors, and its IQR metric was negatively correlated with prediction error. An ensemble of models selected based on low mean IQR demonstrated superior performance over naive ensembles or single models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that uncertainty metrics like IQR can serve as effective, label-free heuristics for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions, emphasizing their utility in ensemble strategies for in-context learners.

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long training times and massive energy consumption required for modern LLMs demand innovative solutions.

Method: Litespark introduces optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers, combining architectural and algorithmic enhancements to boost Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU).

Result: Benchmarks on Llama-3B/30B models show 2x-6x throughput improvement and 55%-83% reduction in energy use on H200 GPU clusters.

Conclusion: Litespark presents a hardware-agnostic and broadly applicable framework for efficient transformer training and post-training phases.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

*Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez,Cameron Allen,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF), a method for learning factored Markov decision process representations directly from high-dimensional observations, outperforming other disentanglement methods in three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods that utilize factored Markov decision processes require known factored representations, limiting their use with high-dimensional observations. Current deep reinforcement learning approaches fail to exploit factored structures.

Method: The authors propose ACF, a contrastive learning approach that identifies independently controllable latent variables. It exploits sparse action effects, only influencing a subset of variables and using the rest as informative data for training.

Result: ACF successfully extracts ground truth controllable factors directly from pixel-based inputs in benchmarks like Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey. It shows better performance compared to baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Conclusion: The ACF method bridges the gap between high-dimensional observation learning and leveraging factored structures, demonstrating its capability to use latent factorization for improved decision-making.

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

*Nicholas Lourie,He He,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the hyperparameter loss surface and introduces a theory with new tools for understanding its structure near the optimum, leveraging random search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale models make it difficult to perform extensive hyperparameter searches, requiring new techniques to optimize training effectively while understanding hyperparameter impact.

Method: The authors utilize random search to investigate the loss surface near its optimum, discovering key structural features and a new distribution that defines the surface parameters.

Result: They derive an asymptotic law based on these structural features, enabling analyses such as performance confidence intervals and determining the effective number of hyperparameters.

Conclusion: The proposed tools and insights allow researchers to better understand hyperparameter landscapes, offering scalable methods for optimization and evaluation.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with bounded extremum seeking (ES) for robust control of nonlinear, time-varying systems, illustrating improved performance and robustness through numerical studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of DRL in handling non-linear, time-varying systems and mitigate its vulnerability to rapid model changes through the integration of the robust features of ES.

Method: The paper combines DRL, which learns from historical data for quick control, with bounded ES, which provides robustness to time variations and unknown control directions.

Result: The hybrid DRL-ES controller demonstrates superior performance in controlling time-varying systems, with applications, including automatic tuning of particle accelerators.

Conclusion: The results indicate that the complementary properties of DRL and bounded ES significantly enhance system performance and robustness beyond their independent capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

*Jiangnan Li,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Abbasnejad,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a connection between supervised fine-tuning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning, revealing that SFT implicitly learns token-level reward models and improves policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional view of supervised fine-tuning as mere imitation learning and demonstrate its deeper role in reward learning.

Method: The authors prove SFT is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, recover dense reward models from SFT, and use them to refine policies with their Dense-Path REINFORCE method.

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE improves policies trained via SFT, outperforming standard SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: Supervised fine-tuning is reframed as a reward learning mechanism, enhancing its scope for leveraging expert demonstrations in more granular and effective ways.

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Though Wasserstein barycenters have applications across multiple fields, existing methods do not account for the privacy concerns associated with sensitive datasets.

Method: Differentially private algorithms were developed to compute Wasserstein barycenters, ensuring privacy while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data, MNIST, and U.S. population datasets showed the methods achieve high-quality private barycenters with favorable accuracy-privacy balances.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of computing Wasserstein barycenters while preserving differential privacy, expanding their practical applications.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our
knowledge, the first algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters under
differential privacy. Empirically, on synthetic data, MNIST, and large-scale
U.S. population datasets, our methods produce high-quality private barycenters
with strong accuracy-privacy tradeoffs.

TL;DR: SFMG introduces a scalable and efficient framework for generating diverse graphs while capturing complex geometric structures using spectral geometry and flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph generation methods often overlook geometric structures induced by eigenvectors and the global structure of graphs.

Method: SFMG uses spectral eigenmaps to embed graphs in Riemannian manifolds, defines geodesic flows between embeddings, and matches distributions along these flows to generate output graphs.

Result: SFMG achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, provides up to 30× speedup over diffusion models, and demonstrates generalization to unseen graph scales.

Conclusion: SFMG integrates spectral geometry with flow matching to offer an efficient and scalable approach for generating diverse graphs with enhanced geometric structure modeling.

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generation of protein backbones using diffusion-based models is slow, requiring numerous computational steps, hindering their application for large-scale protein discovery.

Method: The authors adapt and refine the Score identity Distillation (SiD) strategy, integrating multistep generation and inference time noise modulation to optimize sampling while sustaining quality.

Result: The new few-step generators achieved over 20-fold faster sampling and maintained comparable designability, diversity, and novelty as a teacher model.

Conclusion: This work significantly reduces the computational bottleneck, making diffusion-based protein design models more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

*Imran Thobani,Javier Sagastuy-Brena,Aran Nayebi,Jacob Prince,Rosa Cao,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) as a method for better comparing artificial neural networks with brain responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of consensus on the correct method for comparing neural network model activations to actual brain responses.

Method: The researchers propose the IATC framework which maps neural responses among subjects and models to assess alignment. This was tested in simulated networks, mouse, and human data.

Result: The IATC accurately predicted neural activity, identified neural mechanisms, and distinguished responses across brain areas while maintaining alignment within same brain areas.

Conclusion: The IATC resolves tradeoffs between predictive accuracy and mechanistic understanding, offering a robust framework for principled comparisons of models and brain data.

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

*Nidhi Soley,Vishal M Patel,Casey O Taylor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based autoencoder for clustering and predicting outcomes using wearable data, outperforming baseline methods in accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of clustering and outcome prediction from longitudinal wearable data while ensuring model interpretability and accuracy.

Method: The model leverages an attention-based GRU autoencoder that integrates three objectives: sequence reconstruction, end-of-period depression classification, and behavioral subtyping using Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: AttentiveGRUAE achieves superior clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70) and depression classification performance (AUC = 0.74) compared to baselines, with external validation confirming results.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in clustering and predicting outcomes from longitudinal data with interpretable insights, particularly for identifying sleep-related behavior patterns relevant to clinical risk assessments.

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces High-Order Derivative Graph Neural Networks (HOD-GNNs), leveraging derivatives to enhance the expressivity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), with performance aligning to the WL hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited expressivity issue in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by exploring the use of derivatives as a powerful enhancement.

Method: The authors propose HOD-GNN, a framework that uses high-order derivatives of node embeddings generated by MPNNs. These derivatives are further processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.

Result: Theoretical alignment of HOD-GNN's expressive power with the WL hierarchy and computational improvements using sparse and parallel computing. Strong performance was demonstrated on benchmark graph learning tasks.

Conclusion: HOD-GNN enhances the structure-aware node embeddings and overall GNN expressivity, showing connections to subgraph-based methods and structural encoding schemes with practical computational efficiency.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

*Foivos Alimisis,Rustem Islamov,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explains why learning rate warm-up improves deep learning training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning rate warm-up is widely used but lacks theoretical understanding.

Method: The authors build on $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness and analyze its theoretical and empirical effects on training performance.

Result: Warm-up schedules are proven to provide faster convergence compared to fixed learning rates.

Conclusion: Warm-up improves training efficiency, validated through theory and experiments.

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

### [195] [Best-of-Majority: Minimax-Optimal Strategy for Pass@$k$ Inference Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03199)
*Qiwei Di,Kaixuan Ji,Xuheng Li,Heyang Zhao,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel inference strategy, Best-of-Majority (BoM), that combines majority voting and Best-of-N, addressing the challenges in Pass@$k$ inference scaling for improved large language model (LLM) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of single-shot selection methods, such as majority voting and Best-of-N, which underperform for difficult tasks in LLM inference. Existing methods fail to scale effectively with the number of candidate responses ($k$) and the sampling budget ($N$).

Method: The proposed Best-of-Majority (BoM) strategy restricts candidates to high-frequency responses in $N$ samples before final selection. The paper presents theoretical guarantees for BoM's performance, including its regret scaling properties, and proves its minimax optimality.

Result: BoM achieves superior performance compared to existing methods (majority voting and Best-of-N), especially for challenging tasks. Theoretical results show that BoM's regret scales efficiently with $k$ and $N$, and empirical experiments on math problems validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study highlights BoM as a robust and optimal solution for Pass@$k$ inference, offering improved performance without degradation as the sampling budget increases and demonstrating both theoretical and practical benefits.

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

*Ahmed Hendawy,Henrik Metternich,Théo Vincent,Mahdi Kallel,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MINTO, a novel update rule that uses the minimum estimate between target and online networks for RL, aimed at faster and stable value function learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Target networks in deep RL ensure stability but cause slow learning. The paper seeks a method combining stability and faster value updates.

Method: MINTO computes RL targets using the minimum value between the Target network and Online network to balance stability and overestimation bias.

Result: Extensive evaluations across RL benchmarks show consistent performance improvements in online, offline, discrete, and continuous action spaces.

Conclusion: MINTO enables faster and stable learning with broad applicability, integrating seamlessly into various RL algorithms.

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

TL;DR: The study explores ML-augmented, physically-interpretable hydrological models across diverse conditions, emphasizing appropriate model complexity for improved understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hydrological modeling often lacks predictive improvements tied to enhanced physical understanding, prompting a study integrating machine learning with physical principles.

Method: The researchers used Mass-Conserving Perceptron (MCP)-based models with varying complexities, evaluating them against benchmarks like LSTM across diverse CONUS-wide regions.

Result: MCP-based models achieved comparable performance to LSTM in diverse hydro-geo-climatic conditions, emphasizing model complexity tailored to hydrological processes.

Conclusion: Physically grounded, interpretable model architectures have the potential to advance large-sample hydrology, making future models mechanistically robust and adaptable to dynamic conditions.

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MINERVA, a neural network-based method for feature selection using mutual information to better capture complex feature-target interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to model higher-order feature interactions, limiting their applicability when individual features do not independently represent a target.

Method: The authors employed neural networks to estimate mutual information, incorporating sparsity-inducing regularizers and a decoupled two-stage process for representation learning and feature selection.

Result: MINERVA successfully captured higher-order feature dependencies, demonstrating superior performance on synthetic and real-life fraud datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a strong alternative for supervised feature selection, excelling in detecting complex feature-target relationships.

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

TL;DR: TabImpute is a transformer-based model for missing data imputation, providing accurate and fast results without needing hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imputation methods for missing data in tabular settings show inconsistent performance across domains and require time-intensive hyperparameter tuning.

Method: TabImpute utilizes a pre-trained transformer architecture, combines an efficient entry-wise featurization for tabular data, and leverages a synthetic training data generation pipeline to mimic realistic missing data scenarios.

Result: TabImpute achieved a $100\times$ speedup compared to TabPFN, demonstrated strong test-time performance, and outperformed 11 established imputation methods across 42 datasets in the MissBench benchmark.

Conclusion: TabImpute is a robust and efficient zero-shot imputation method, establishing itself as a promising default choice for handling missing data in diverse real-world domains.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and
time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists.
Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast
zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at
inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise
featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness
patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,
showcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HyperAdaLoRA, a hypernetwork-based framework designed to accelerate the convergence of AdaLoRA during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning approaches like LoRA assign equal rank across all model layers and modules, which does not adapt to varying weight matrix significance and results in inefficiencies.

Method: HyperAdaLoRA uses attention-based hypernetworks to dynamically generate SVD parameters and applies pruning to introduce adaptive rank allocation.

Result: Experiments show HyperAdaLoRA achieves faster convergence while maintaining strong performance and can be extended to other LoRA-based approaches.

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA enhances fine-tuning efficiency and adaptability, showing broad applicability in improving rank allocation dynamics within PEFT techniques.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

*Hemang Jain,Shailender Goyal,Divyansh Pandey,Karthik Vaidhyanathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel methodology for fine-grained energy analysis in LLMs, revealing discrepancies between computational metrics and actual energy costs, particularly in Attention blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The environmental impact of LLM inference, especially its large-scale energy footprint, is not effectively addressed due to the lack of granular, component-level measurement methods.

Method: The paper proposes CLEAR (Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling) to measure energy consumption at the microsecond level, overcoming typical sensors' limitations. It analyzes energy usage for 15 models across four architecture types and achieves high component-wise energy measurement accuracy.

Result: Using CLEAR, the study finds Attention blocks consume disproportionately higher energy per floating-point operation (FLOP), proving that FLOPs are insufficient predictors for energy costs. Over 90% of a model's total energy is successfully attributed to specific components.

Conclusion: The findings offer detailed benchmarks for component-level energy consumption in transformer architectures and pave the way for designing energy-efficient models through targeted optimizations.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to optimize inspection vehicle properties for better bridge damage detection using an unsupervised deep learning approach. Lighter vehicles with specific frequency ratios are found to be most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bridge health monitoring through drive-by inspection struggles due to the mechanical and dynamic properties of inspection vehicles, reducing detection effectiveness.

Method: The study uses adversarial autoencoders to reconstruct frequency-domain responses and optimizes vehicle parameters (e.g., tyre suspension) by minimizing the Wasserstein distance between damage indices. The optimization is facilitated by a Kriging meta-model.

Result: Vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3 and 0.7 of a bridge’s first natural frequency are better at detecting damage, while vehicles near resonance perform poorly. Light vehicles shift optimal frequency ratios downward.

Conclusion: Optimizing vehicle parameters improves bridge damage detection sensitivity in drive-by inspections, marking the first proposal of a purpose-built inspection vehicle in this domain.

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Method: TutorBench consists of 1,490 human-curated samples across three tutoring tasks. Evaluations use an LLM-judge equipped with sample-specific rubrics for fine-grained assessment.

Result: None of the evaluated 16 frontier LLMs surpassed 56% in core tutoring skills. Performances varied with strengths and weaknesses across different model families, e.g., Claude models excelled in promoting active learning but struggled in other areas.

Conclusion: TutorBench provides an unsaturated benchmark to steer the progress of future AI tutors, highlighting current gaps and guiding improvements in adaptive learning capabilities.

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

### [204] [Topological Invariance and Breakdown in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02670)
*Yongyi Yang,Tomaso Poggio,Isaac Chuang,Liu Ziyin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how different learning rates affect neuron distribution topology during training, proving a qualitative difference based on a critical learning rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental behavior of neuron distributions under permutation-equivariant learning rules and learning rates is important for improving deep learning models' expressivity.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze training dynamics using topological constraints and bi-Lipschitz mappings, establishing critical conditions for learning rate behavior.

Result: The study reveals a critical learning rate below which topology is preserved, while larger rates enable topological simplification, reducing model expressivity.

Conclusion: Neural networks undergo two learning phases: one constrained by topological preservation and another marked by simplifications. The findings apply universally across architectures and loss functions.

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

TL;DR: The paper studies low-precision formats for Generative AI (GenAI) models, introducing a new FP8 format, ECF8, to optimize performance without computation loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling GenAI models to hundreds of billions of parameters increases the demand for efficient, low-precision computation to ensure numerical stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency.

Method: The authors identify and analyze the exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights using theoretical proofs and empirical studies, proposing a new FP8 format, ECF8, designed for entropy-aware encoding and optimized decoding.

Result: They achieve up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1% throughput acceleration on models up to 671B parameters, with no deviation in model outputs.

Conclusion: Exponent concentration is proven to be a statistical property of trained models, paving the way for efficient and lossless low-precision FP8 designs in AI model computation.

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

### [206] [Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models:Toward Joint Visualization of Interactive and Independent Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21923)
*Fumin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method called Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs) that enhance interpretability in machine learning while achieving improved predictive performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between achieving interpretability and predictive performance in machine learning models, especially for high-stakes applications like healthcare.

Method: The paper proposes MACMs, which combine multiplicative and additive components, allowing visualization of shape functions for both components. This disentangles interactive and independent effects while broadening the hypothesis space.

Result: MACMs outperform Curve Ergodic Set Regression (CESR) and state-of-the-art Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) in predictive performance.

Conclusion: MACMs constitute a significant improvement over existing models by balancing both interpretability and predictive performance, making them valuable for applications requiring high accountability.

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

TL;DR: This paper explores neural operators, their classification, explanation mechanisms, predictive models, and the integration of physical principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to deepen understanding of neural operator learning mechanisms, classify them, and advance frameworks for incorporating physics into data-driven models.

Method: The authors classify neural operators into spatial and functional domain models, propose explanation methods for prediction-making, evaluate a dual-space multi-scale model, and discuss principles for integrating physics.

Result: They demonstrate how neural operators can learn hidden physical patterns but emphasize current limitations and introduce a dual-space model achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Neural operators can uncover complex physical dynamics and highlight the need for more generalizable explanation methods and principled approaches to integrate known physics.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoSpeak combines genetic programming (GP) with large language models (LLMs) to evolve effective, interpretable heuristics for dynamic optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in dynamic and large-scale optimization problems, where complex GP heuristics hinder interpretability, slow convergence, and limit transferability.

Method: EvoSpeak integrates GP with LLMs to learn from high-quality GP heuristics, generate warm-start populations, translate GP trees into natural language, and enable cross-task knowledge transfer.

Result: Experiments on dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS) show EvoSpeak generates more effective heuristics, improves efficiency, and delivers interpretable, human-readable explanations.

Conclusion: EvoSpeak advances heuristic evolution by combining symbolic GP reasoning with LLM interpretability, producing intelligent, transparent, and adaptable solutions for optimization problems.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

*Gautham Govind Anil,Shaan Ul Haque,Nithish Kannen,Dheeraj Nagaraj,Sanjay Shakkottai,Karthikeyan Shanmugam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces P-GRAFT and inverse noise correction methods to enhance diffusion-based generative models, showing improvements over existing policy gradient strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to shape pre-trained diffusion models to align with downstream applications using reward functions, overcoming the challenges of intractable marginal likelihoods.

Method: The approach involves unifying RAFT techniques as GRAFT, introducing P-GRAFT for fine-tuning at intermediate noise levels, and proposing inverse noise correction for flow model enhancements without explicit rewards.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved generation quality across multiple domains, with notable performance gains in text-to-image generation benchmarks and unconditional image generation using fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance the effectiveness and efficiency of fine-tuning diffusion models, achieving better alignment with rewards and improved generative outcomes.

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

*Kai Fukazawa,Kunal Mundada,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAMAC, a framework that balances risk sensitivity and policy expressiveness in offline RL using a generative actor and a distributional critic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving safety in offline RL without compromising policy expressiveness or value conservatism.

Method: Introduces RAMAC, which incorporates expressive generative actors and distributional critics, employing composite objectives for risk-sensitive learning in multimodal scenarios.

Result: RAMAC improves risk measures while delivering strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks, using diffusion and flow-matching actors.

Conclusion: RAMAC successfully achieves risk-aware learning in offline RL settings, combining safety and performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Method: TSLT-Net leverages Temporal Spatial Transformer models to process temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in drone network traffic, featuring a unified architecture for multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection.

Result: TSLT-Net achieved 99.99% accuracy in multiclass detection and 100% accuracy in binary anomaly detection on the ISOT Drone Anomaly Detection Dataset, while maintaining an extremely lightweight design with 9722 parameters and a memory footprint of 0.04 MB.

Conclusion: TSLT-Net is a highly effective, resource-efficient, and scalable intrusion detection system suitable for real-time deployment on UAV edge devices in critical missions.

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the performance upper bound of deep time series forecasting by establishing an 'accuracy law' linking forecasting error to the complexity of time series patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the growth of deep time series forecasting, researchers often face confusion due to insignificant improvements on benchmarks. The paper aims to provide clarity by identifying the performance upper bound, addressing the inherent non-zero error of time series due to its uncertain nature.

Method: The authors conducted statistical tests on over 2,800 deep time series models and analyzed the relationship between forecasting errors and window-wise series complexity in the sequence-to-sequence paradigm.

Result: A significant exponential relationship between forecasting error and window-wise pattern complexity, termed the 'accuracy law,' was identified. This discovery highlights saturated tasks in benchmarks and guides training strategies for large time series models.

Conclusion: The accuracy law offers a framework to evaluate and guide deep time series forecasting, relieving researchers from redundant tasks and advancing the understanding of model capabilities.

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biologically-inspired optimization method based on Dale's law and geometric Brownian motion, resulting in a novel generative model for positive data with log-normal distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent computational neuroscience findings indicate a mismatch between standard gradient descent optimization and learning in biological systems, inspiring exploration of biologically-consistent techniques.

Method: The authors derive an optimization scheme based on Dale's law, logarithmic synaptic weight distribution, and connections to geometric Brownian motion, leading to a multiplicative update rule and a new denoising score-matching formalism for positive data.

Result: Their method enables training of generative models using log-normal distributions and demonstrates effective performance on datasets like MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji for sample generation.

Conclusion: The work introduces a novel biologically-inspired generative model that uses multiplicative updates and successfully integrates principles of geometric Brownian motion into learning algorithms.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

*Tianxiang Zhao,Youqing Wang,Jinlu Wang,Jiapu Wang,Mingliang Cui,Junbin Gao,Jipeng Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel graph clustering method, RAGC, enhancing contrastive learning by introducing hybrid-collaborative augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness (CSADA), showcasing superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAGC methods inadequately address edge-level embedding augmentation and the interplay with node-level embedding. Additionally, there’s an oversight in the differential treatment of hard and easy positive-negative contrastive pairs.

Method: The authors introduce the RAGC framework, which incorporates HCA to simultaneously execute node-level and edge-level augmentation, and CSADA to adaptively weigh contrastive sample pairs using a specialized weight modulation function informed by pseudo-labels.

Result: Evaluations on six benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGC's clear superiority in graph clustering compared to state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Conclusion: The HCA and CSADA modules synergize to enhance graph clustering, offering a robust and discriminative alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TokenFlow is a system that enhances real-time streamed token generations in LLM interactions by implementing preemptive scheduling and proactive memory management, achieving better responsiveness and resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM serving systems struggle with resource utilization and parallel processing during request bursts due to their inflexible scheduling and memory management.

Method: TokenFlow uses dynamic prioritization of requests based on real-time metrics and manages cache transfers between GPU and CPU memory to reduce processing delays.

Result: TokenFlow shows up to 82.5% higher effective throughput and reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 80.2% without compromising overall token throughput.

Conclusion: TokenFlow's design enhances text streaming performance, contributing to more efficient and responsive LLM serving systems.

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV

*Nicholas LaHaye,Kelly M. Luis,Michelle M. Gierach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-supervised machine learning framework called SIT-FUSE was developed to detect harmful algal blooms using multi-sensor satellite data, achieving high accuracy without requiring labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting harmful algal blooms in label-scarce environments using satellite data.

Method: The SIT-FUSE framework fuses satellite reflectance data with fluorescence metrics, employs self-supervised learning, and hierarchical deep clustering validated against in-situ data.

Result: The framework achieved strong agreement with measurements of phytoplankton and harmful algal bloom species in multiple regions over several years.

Conclusion: SIT-FUSE offers a scalable and interpretable approach for global monitoring of harmful algal blooms, paving the way for advancements in aquatic biogeochemistry research.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic
biogeochemistry.

*Hugo Ninou,Jonathan Kadmon,N. Alex Cayco-Gajic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores 'curl'-like non-gradient components in biological learning dynamics, revealing their potential to optimize loss functions, stabilize or destabilize solutions, and enhance learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if biological neural networks utilize fundamentally non-gradient strategies like 'curl' components for effective loss optimization, contrasting with gradient descent mechanisms found in artificial models.

Method: Analyze feedforward networks in a student-teacher framework, systematically introducing non-gradient "curl" dynamics and examining their impact on stability and learning outcomes.

Result: Small curl components preserve stability and mimic gradient descent, while large curls destabilize learning dynamics, potentially leading to chaos or faster learning by escaping local minima temporarily.

Conclusion: Curl dynamics offer a diverse yet effective paradigm for learning in specific architectures, challenging the dominance of gradient descent-based theories in neural networks.

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

*Shashank Agnihotri,Jonas Jakubassa,Priyam Dey,Sachin Goyal,Bernt Schiele,Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes whether open-weight LLM safety mechanisms, like refusal training, remain effective under inference-time edits via model abliteration, using SmolLM2-1.7B as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if common safety interventions, like refusal training, in open-weight LLMs are robust against activation edits during inference.

Method: The authors test 'model abliteration,' a projection technique for removing refusal-sensitive directions, by evaluating 20 systems (original and abliterated) across Safety Pretraining checkpoints, using 100 balanced prompts classified by multiple judges.

Result: The study characterizes how safety components hold up under abliteration at different checkpoints, examines the impact of judge selection on outcomes, and confirms whether models recognize refusal in their outputs.

Conclusion: Inference-time edits can influence the robustness of safety mechanisms, and the paper provides a protocol to assess and integrate such edits into LLM safety evaluations.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

### [220] [Optimal Rates for Generalization of Gradient Descent for Deep ReLU Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02779)
*Yuanfan Li,Yunwen Lei,Zheng-Chu Guo,Yiming Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether gradient descent (GD) methods can achieve optimal generalization rates in deep ReLU networks, establishing that it is possible with polynomial dependence on network depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding whether GD methods can reach minimax optimal generalization rates for deep neural networks, especially for deep ReLU architectures.

Method: The authors analyze the generalization error of GD on deep ReLU networks using the assumption of NTK separable data with margin and leverage activation patterns for tighter complexity bounds.

Result: The paper establishes an excess risk rate of \(\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))\), closely aligning with the optimal SVM-type rates up to depth-related factors.

Conclusion: Gradient descent can achieve near-optimal generalization rates for deep ReLU networks with polynomial dependence on network depth, addressing gaps in prior work and offering sharper complexity bounds.

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

### [222] [Relevance-Aware Thresholding in Online Conformal Prediction for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02809)
*Théo Dupuy,Binbin Xu,Stéphane Perrey,Jacky Montmain,Abdelhak Imoussaten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve Online Conformal Prediction (OCP) for time series by replacing the binary evaluation during threshold updates with functions that quantify the relevance of prediction intervals, leading to tighter intervals while retaining coverage validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the current limitation in Online Conformal Prediction methods, where the focus is solely on whether the ground truth falls inside or outside the prediction interval, neglecting the interval's relevance.

Method: The authors enhance the threshold update step in OCP by introducing a broader class of functions. These functions evaluate the relevance of prediction intervals based on the ground truth instead of relying on a binary (inside/outside) measure.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces narrower prediction intervals while preserving coverage validity, outperforming existing OCP methods.

Conclusion: By considering the relevance of prediction intervals during threshold updates, this method enhances OCP, offering a better trade-off between interval tightness and coverage validity.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

*Sung Ho Jo,Seonghwi Kim,Minwoo Chae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical extension of Group DRO to address both inter- and intra-group distribution shifts, providing robustness where existing methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerability of supervised learning methods to spurious correlations, especially under distribution shifts, and the lack of robust approaches for intra-group uncertainties.

Method: A hierarchical extension of Group DRO was proposed, along with new benchmark settings to simulate realistic minority group distribution shifts.

Result: The proposed method is robust under minority group distribution shifts and outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the need to expand ambiguity sets to account for both inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties, ensuring improved robustness.

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

*Martino Bernasconi,Andrea Celli,Riccardo Colini-Baldeschi,Federico Fusco,Stefano Leonardi,Matteo Russo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the random-order model in online learning, a setting blending adversarial and stochastic characteristics, and proposes strategies to adapt stochastic learning algorithms for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differences between random-order inputs and standard stochastic ones can cause non-stationarity, impairing the performance of stochastic algorithms. There is a need to bridge the gap for effective online learning.

Method: The authors propose a general framework to adapt stochastic algorithms for the random-order model, ensuring regret guarantees remain unaffected while extending application to scenarios like delays, constraints, and switching costs.

Result: The proposed framework recovers enhanced regret bounds in various learning scenarios. It also demonstrates that online classification in the random-order setting is tied to VC dimension rather than Littlestone dimension.

Conclusion: The paper successfully adapts stochastic learning algorithms for the random-order model, enhancing performance and separating learnability characterizations from the adversarial model.

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

*Jaemin Kim,Hongjun Um,Sungkyun Kim,Yongjun Park,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexiQ is an adaptive mixed-precision quantization technique for neural network models, optimizing accuracy and hardware efficiency by adjusting low-bitwidth computations dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable hardware solutions for real-time neural network workloads are challenging due to the cost and resource limitations of accelerators like NPUs and GPUs.

Method: FlexiQ adopts a selective low-bitwidth computation mechanism, efficiently minimizes quantization errors, and dynamically adjusts bitwidths in real-time to adapt to fluctuating workloads.

Result: FlexiQ improved accuracy by 6.6% for 4-bit models on average, outperformed previous quantization techniques, and achieved a significant accuracy-latency trade-off with minimal runtime overhead.

Conclusion: FlexiQ presents a practical solution for real-time neural network applications, combining state-of-the-art quantization accuracy with efficient hardware execution.

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

*Makram Chahine,Philipp Nazari,Daniela Rus,T. Konstantin Rusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a method to efficiently train State Space Models (SSMs) by compressing their dimensionality during training, balancing computational cost and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSMs face challenges in balancing expressivity and computational efficiency, especially for long sequence modeling tasks.

Method: The approach leverages control theory concepts like Hankel singular value analysis to identify influential state dimensions and perform in-training system reduction for SSMs.

Result: Experiments show that dimensionality reduction during training accelerates optimization without losing the model's task-related expressivity.

Conclusion: Starting with large SSMs and employing dimension reduction during training leads to models that are both computationally efficient and high-performing.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

TL;DR: The paper revisits Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models as an iterative-refinement framework, linking it to denoising diffusion and detailing design choices for efficiency and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a need to enhance efficiency and fidelity of VAR through structured refinement and explores its connection to other frameworks like diffusion.

Method: The proposed method formalizes VAR as a deterministic forward process for constructing latent pyramids, and a learned backward process for reconstruction, emphasizing latent space refinement, discrete classification, and spatial-frequency task partitioning.

Result: Controlled experiments were conducted to quantify the contributions of individual design choices to the model’s fidelity and speed, and extensions were explored including graph generation and weather forecasting.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical interface for leveraging diffusion tools while retaining efficient few-step scale-parallel generation capabilities.

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

*Dohyun Bu,Jisoo Han,Soohwa Kwon,Yulim So,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Subject-Adaptive Sparse Linear (SASL) framework for personalized health predictions using lifelog data, aiming for interpretable and accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-of-the-art models for health predictions sacrifice interpretability and fail to adequately address individual variability in lifelog data.

Method: The paper proposes SASL, combining regression with subject-specific interactions, a sparse model selection process using nested F-tests, a regression-then-thresholding approach for ordinal targets, and a hybrid integration with LightGBM based on confidence gating.

Result: Evaluations on the CH-2025 dataset show that the SASL-LightGBM framework achieves similar predictive performance to black-box methods but with better interpretability and fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed framework delivers actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners, advancing personalized health prediction methods and overcoming challenges of traditional black-box models.

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Karma," a knowledge-aware model leveraging frequency-adaptive learning for robust battery health prognostics, significantly improving prediction accuracy over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate battery health prognostics are essential for safety, efficiency, and sustainability in energy systems but face challenges due to nonlinear and noisy battery degradation behavior, capacity regeneration, and lack of knowledge guidance in existing models.

Method: Karma combines signal decomposition with a dual-stream deep learning architecture to capture both long-term trends and short-term dynamics. It integrates knowledge-guided regulations via a double exponential degradation model optimized through particle filters.

Result: Karma demonstrates superior accuracy, reducing prediction errors by 50.6% and 32.6% compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on two mainstream datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model shows robustness, generalizability, and promise for safer, more reliable battery management across various applications.

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RoiRL, an efficient offline reinforcement learning method for reasoning in LLMs, reducing computational costs and surpassing TTRL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTRL's reliance on heavy online RL and substantial computational resources limits scalability for reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Method: The proposed RoiRL framework optimizes weighted log-likelihood objectives instead of maintaining a reference model, enabling stable offline learning with reduced memory and compute requirements.

Result: RoiRL is 2.5x faster in training than TTRL and consistently outperforms it on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: RoiRL offers a scalable, computationally efficient alternative for self-improving LLMs without ground-truth labels.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

*Linyu Wu,Linhao Zhong,Wenjie Qu,Yuexin Li,Yue Liu,Shengfang Zhai,Chunhua Shen,Jiaheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DMark, a watermarking framework for diffusion large language models (dLLMs), which restores watermarking capabilities despite dLLMs' non-sequential token generation feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods fail for dLLMs due to their non-sequential token generation approach, necessitating a new framework.

Method: The authors propose DMark, which employs predictive watermarking, bidirectional watermarking, and a combination of both (predictive-bidirectional watermarking) to allow for effective watermarking in dLLMs.

Result: DMark achieves 92.0-99.5% detection rates at a low 1% false positive rate while preserving text quality, outperforming traditional watermarking methods adapted for dLLMs.

Conclusion: DMark successfully enables effective watermarking for dLLMs, showcasing robustness against text manipulations and demonstrating feasibility for non-autoregressive models.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing

*Jan-Philipp von Bassewitz,Adeel Pervez,Marco Fumero,Matthew Robinson,Theofanis Karaletsos,Francesco Locatello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Cell-MNN, a neural network model for studying cellular differentiation dynamics which achieves competitive performance and interpretable gene interaction learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve understanding and treatment of diseases associated with cellular differentiation, like cancer, using machine learning on single-cell data.

Method: Cell-MNN, an encoder-decoder neural network, uses a locally linearized ODE to model cellular evolution dynamics and explicitly learns gene interactions. The method is end-to-end with standard PCA preprocessing.

Result: Cell-MNN demonstrates competitive performance in single-cell benchmarks, scales better to larger datasets, and validates learned gene interactions against the TRRUST database.

Conclusion: Cell-MNN offers an efficient, interpretable, and biologically consistent model for cellular differentiation dynamics, outperforming existing methods in scalability and gene interaction discovery.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FeDABoost framework improves Federated Learning's fairness and performance in non-IID settings by focusing on enhancing model aggregation and training underperforming clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of fairness and performance in Federated Learning, especially in scenarios where data is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID).

Method: Proposes an aggregation mechanism inspired by Multiclass AdaBoost to assign higher weights to reliable clients and introduces a boosting mechanism to dynamically adjust training for underperforming clients using focal loss parameters.

Result: FeDABoost demonstrates improved fairness and competitive performance compared to baseline methods (FedAvg and Ditto) on MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets.

Conclusion: FeDABoost enhances fairness in contribution and improves performance, making it a robust framework for Federated Learning in non-IID environments.

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

*Aydin Javadov,Samir Garibov,Tobias Hoesli,Qiyang Sun,Florian von Wangenheim,Joseph Ollier,Björn W. Schuller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to enhance medical time series classification by integrating stochastic sparse sampling with retrieval-based approaches for better explainability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical time series data is complex due to issues like noise, data sparsity, and variable recording lengths, creating a need for robust and explainable classification methods.

Method: The authors generalize stochastic sparse sampling by weighting predictions based on within-channel similarity and aggregating them in probability space, which improves classification scores and provides evidence for explainability.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive classification performance in iEEG data, collected from four medical centers, while enhancing transparency and interpretability.

Conclusion: The study presents a reliable and explainable framework for variable-length time series classification, demonstrating its utility in clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

*Juan Sebastian Rojas,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper re-examines continual reinforcement learning (RL) from a risk-aware decision-making perspective, introducing "ergodic risk measures" to address theoretical incompatibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift the focus of continual RL research from risk-neutral decision-making toward risk-aware decision-making, optimizing beyond just the mean performance.

Method: Extend risk measure theory to the continual setting using the proposed ergodic risk measures, followed by a case study to validate the new theory.

Result: Introduced ergodic risk measures compatible with continual RL and supported their theoretical soundness with a case study, alongside empirical validation.

Conclusion: Ergodic risk measures provide a more comprehensive framework for risk-aware continual RL, paving the way for agents that balance retention and adaptation beyond mean performance.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextFlow, a novel framework for inferring biologically meaningful trajectories from spatially-resolved omics data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding of tissue dynamics in various biological processes, such as development, disease progression, and treatment response, using spatially-resolved omics data.

Method: The proposed ContextFlow framework incorporates context-aware features, like local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns, into a transition plausibility matrix to regularize trajectory inference via optimal transport.

Result: Experimental evaluation on three datasets shows that ContextFlow surpasses state-of-the-art flow matching methods in terms of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

Conclusion: ContextFlow is a generalizable and effective framework for modeling spatiotemporal tissue dynamics, providing biologically meaningful insights from longitudinal omics data.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

*Weijian Deng,Weijie Tu,Ibrahim Radwan,Mohammad Abu Alsheikh,Stephen Gould,Liang Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for assessing model generalization under distribution shift in unsupervised settings using confidence and dispersity properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring reliable model performance under distribution shift in real-world deployments where labeled test data is unavailable.

Method: Propose a unified framework using metrics derived from confidence and dispersity for unsupervised evaluation of models on unlabeled data.

Result: Hybrid metrics outperform single-aspect ones, with nuclear norm metrics proving robust across datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: Confidence and dispersity offer reliable assessment signals for deployment scenarios; nuclear norm metrics are effective for unsupervised model evaluation.

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

*Akriti Sharma,Dogan Altan,Dusica Marijan,Arnbjørn Maressa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transfer learning-based method to predict shaft power in ships, using high-frequency data for model training and low-frequency noon reports for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime transportation growth necessitates energy optimization to reduce operational costs, with shaft power prediction being essential due to its direct impact on fuel consumption.

Method: The approach uses transfer learning, starting with high-frequency data for training and later fine-tuning on low-frequency noon reports from different vessels, including sister and distinct vessels.

Result: Experiments revealed significant improvements in prediction accuracy, decreasing mean absolute percentage errors by 10.6%, 3.6%, and 5.3% for sister, similar, and different vessels respectively.

Conclusion: Transfer learning leveraging multiple data sources enhances the predictive accuracy of shaft power, aiding efficient maritime operations even with limited sensor data.

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrainIB++, a graph neural network using an information bottleneck principle for diagnostic modeling based on rs-fMRI, improving accuracy, interpretability, and alignment with clinical schizophrenia biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of both conventional machine learning (feature engineering bias) and deep learning (lack of interpretability) in identifying brain biomarkers for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.

Method: BrainIB++ utilizes a graph neural network framework incorporating the information bottleneck principle, identifying informative brain regions as subgraphs during training.

Result: BrainIB++ achieves better diagnostic accuracy compared to nine established methods, generalizes to unseen data, and identifies brain biomarkers consistent with clinical schizophrenia markers.

Conclusion: BrainIB++ offers an effective, interpretable, and clinically relevant diagnostic tool for psychiatric disorders, enhancing real-world applicability.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

*Feiyang Wu,Ye Zhao,Anqi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that learns reward distributions and enables risk-aware policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IRL approaches are limited as they mainly focus on recovering deterministic rewards or matching expected returns, lacking rich behavior modeling and risk-awareness.

Method: The method captures reward uncertainty and return distributions by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance violations and integrates distortion risk measures into policy learning.

Result: Experiments on synthetic benchmarks, neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo tasks show the method recovers expressive reward representations and achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances behavior analysis and risk-aware learning by modeling reward distributions, advancing IRL capabilities.

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

*Dong-Dong Wu,Jiacheng Cui,Wei Wang,Zhiqiang She,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMIS is a framework for training diffusion models that addresses challenges caused by imprecise supervision in large-scale datasets, improving generative tasks under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels in conditional inputs that degrade the quality of diffusion model training and generation quality.

Method: The proposed DMIS framework introduces a likelihood maximization approach that separates the objective into two components: a generative component for modeling imprecise-label distributions, and a classification component that uses a diffusion classifier to enhance label inference. An optimized timestep sampling strategy is also introduced to improve efficiency.

Result: Experiments confirm that DMIS achieves high-quality and class-discriminative sample generation across tasks like image generation, weakly supervised learning, and noisy dataset condensation.

Conclusion: DMIS provides a robust and unified framework for diffusion models to tackle issues of imprecise supervision, offering consistent improvements in sample generation quality regardless of noise in the data.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight neural network model to classify EEG signals by utilizing balanced signed graphs and spectral denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using EEG signals effectively and with interpretable models.

Method: The study builds transformer-like neural networks by unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm onto a balanced signed graph, implementing an efficient low-pass filter via Lanczos approximation.

Result: The proposed method achieves comparable classification performance to deep learning techniques but with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The approach is efficient and interpretable, offering a potential alternative to complex deep learning systems for EEG signal analysis.

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHORD, a device-cloud collaborative framework for hybrid-precision on-device model customization, improving recommendation accuracy while optimizing resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in on-device deployment of reranking models, including the need for model compression due to device resource heterogeneity and the downside of compromised personalization in current quantization methods.

Method: CHORD employs channel-wise mixed-precision quantization, supported by cloud-based hypernetwork modules, for resource-adaptive and personalized model deployment. It identifies user-specific critical parameters and optimizes inference without requiring backpropagation.

Result: Experiments on three datasets with SASRec and Caser backbones show that CHORD achieves enhanced recommendation accuracy, efficiency, and adaptivity. It significantly reduces communication overhead by encoding strategies with minimal data.

Conclusion: CHORD successfully bridges the gap between efficient on-device recommendations and user personalization, offering a scalable solution for heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bayesian equivariant machine learning potentials (MLPs) with a novel loss function to improve uncertainty quantification, enabling enhanced active learning, out-of-distribution detection, and calibration of energies and forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning potentials struggle with uncertainty quantification, restricting their reliability for tasks like active learning and calibration in atomistic simulations.

Method: The authors develop Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs using a joint energy-force negative log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function and compare various Bayesian approaches including deep ensembles, stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, and others.

Result: Bayesian MLPs achieve improved uncertainty prediction, out-of-distribution detection, calibration, and active learning performance against benchmarks, outperforming random and conventional sampling methods.

Conclusion: Bayesian equivariant neural networks are shown to be effective for uncertainty-aware machine learning potentials, enhancing both accuracy and scalability for atomistic simulations.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the sample efficiency of black-box optimization tasks and overcome the limitations of traditional Bayesian optimization methods, which rely heavily on hand-tuned hyperparameters that do not generalize well.

Method: Leveraging offline reinforcement learning on optimization trajectories collected from 12 Bayesian Optimization variants and pretraining the model on millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse landscapes to enable transferable optimization policies.

Result: ZeroShotOpt demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization methods in sample efficiency across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ZeroShotOpt offers a scalable and reusable foundation for continuous black-box optimization, achieving performance equal to or better than leading optimizers and is open-sourced for community use and development.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Motivation: The paper aims to study the effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms in high-dimensional parametrized action spaces to find approaches with faster convergence, stability, and high returns.

Method: The study compares SAC, GAC, and TQC using two benchmarks involving discrete actions with continuous parameters, employs hyperparameter tuning via Microsoft NNI, and ensures reproducibility by codebase modifications.

Result: PAGAC delivered the fastest training times and highest returns, outperforming other algorithms consistently in both benchmarks with notable stability and efficiency.

Conclusion: PAGAC is confirmed as a superior algorithm for tasks with parametrized action spaces, but future work should explore entropy-regularization hybrids and broaden generalizability research.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor

decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC
and TQC. Results show that Parameterized Action Greedy Actor-Critic (PAGAC)
outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform
game and 24:04 for the Robot Soccer Goal game. Its speed and stability provide
clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks
requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore
hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based

Motivation: Solving the Close-Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP) has been challenging due to its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, which introduces complexity compared to the traditional TSP.

Method: The proposed method formulates CETSP as a Markov decision process (MDP) using a discretization scheme. It introduces a dual-decoder deep reinforcement learning framework (UD3RL) with a node-decoder and loc-decoder for decision-making, alongside a k-nearest neighbors subgraph to assist spatial reasoning. The REINFORCE algorithm is customized for training.

Result: UD3RL outperforms conventional approaches regarding solution quality and runtime and generalizes well across different problem sizes, spatial configurations, and neighborhood radius types. It is also robust to dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: The UD3RL framework shows significant improvements in solving CETSP, demonstrating strong generalization, reduced runtime, and robustness, making it effective for practical applications.

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

### [248] [Bootstrap Learning for Combinatorial Graph Alignment with Sequential GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03086)
*Marc Lelarge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents a new chaining procedure for graph alignment using sequential graph neural networks (GNNs), resulting in significant improvements in accuracy and outperforming traditional optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap in GNNs' underperformance compared to traditional optimization methods for combinatorial problems, focusing on the NP-hard graph alignment task.

Method: The method involves training a sequence of GNNs, with each network refining similarity matrices iteratively, paired with a node-pair architecture to capture essential global structural patterns for graph alignment.

Result: The proposed chaining procedure offers over 3x higher accuracy on challenging benchmarks and uniquely solves cases failed by other methods, outperforming state-of-the-art solvers when integrated with optimization techniques.

Conclusion: Chained GNNs, with integration into optimization strategies, improve graph alignment solutions substantially, demonstrating their utility in solving NP-hard combinatorial problems.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

### [249] [Adaptive Node Feature Selection For Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03096)
*Ali Azizpour,Madeline Navarro,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive node feature selection method for graph neural networks (GNNs) to improve model outputs by identifying and removing irrelevant features during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-structured data brings complex dependencies, making classical feature importance metrics insufficient. This study aims to improve interpretability, dimension reduction, and model performance by addressing this challenge.

Method: The approach leverages an intervention-based strategy that assesses feature relevance through changes in validation performance upon feature value permutations. This method adapts during training, tracking relevance and effectiveness of feature removal.

Result: Empirical studies demonstrate the method's adaptability across various graph architectures, validating its applicability to complex graph learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides feature importance scores, tracks relevance evolution during feature elimination, and proves effective across diverse GNNs, addressing key challenges in graph-structured data processing.

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

### [250] [AdaBet: Gradient-free Layer Selection for Efficient Training of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03101)
*Irene Tenison,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Fahim Kawsar,Mohammad Malekzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaBet is a gradient-free layer selection method for adapting pre-trained neural networks efficiently on edge and mobile devices, improving classification accuracy and reducing memory consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impracticality of retraining deep neural networks on constrained devices due to computational overhead and reliance on labeled data, gradients, or server-side meta-training.

Method: AdaBet analyzes topological features of activation spaces using Betti Numbers, ranking layers for their learning capacity through forward passes without relying on gradients or labels.

Result: Evaluations of AdaBet on benchmark models and datasets show 5% higher classification accuracy compared to gradient-based baselines while reducing peak memory consumption by 40%.

Conclusion: AdaBet effectively selects layers for retraining, offering a resource-efficient solution for on-device neural network adaptation without requiring computationally expensive gradient-based optimization or labeled data.

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

*Muhammad Usama,Haris Koutsopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a ConvLSTM-based framework to predict train headways in urban metro systems, aiding real-time dispatch decisions and improving service reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient headway prediction in metro systems is crucial for reliable service, optimal resource use, and enhanced passenger satisfaction.

Method: The ConvLSTM model uses both historical and planned terminal headway data to predict spatiotemporal headway propagation across stations, enabling proactive operational control.

Result: The ConvLSTM model exhibited strong prediction performance in a large-scale metro dataset, providing actionable insights for optimizing dispatcher strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an efficient tool for rail operators to enhance service consistency and passenger satisfaction by enabling real-time, informed decision-making for train dispatching.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT) for robust asset allocation, using path signatures and attention mechanisms for optimizing risk-aware financial objectives, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep-learning forecasters often fail in asset allocation due to objective mismatch and error amplification, creating a need for models directly optimizing risk-aware financial objectives.

Method: The SIT framework employs path signatures for geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases to learn end-to-end allocation policies.

Result: SIT decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning models when evaluated on S&P 100 equity data, highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing portfolio-aware objectives.

Conclusion: Portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are critical for effective and risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems.

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

*Flavio Giorgi,Matteo Silvestri,Cesare Campagnano,Fabrizio Silvestri,Gabriele Tolomei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a method using Language Models to generate understandable counterfactual explanations, improving their interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to make complex counterfactual explanations from AI models accessible to non-experts.

Method: The authors propose using a novel pipeline that combines Large and Small Language Models with knowledge distillation and refining mechanisms.

Result: The approach successfully boosts reasoning capabilities in Small Language Models, achieving performance similar to large ones.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline makes counterfactual reasoning feasible for real-world applications by enhancing both interpretability and reliability.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

*Dhruv Rohatgi,Abhishek Shetty,Donya Saless,Yuchen Li,Ankur Moitra,Andrej Risteski,Dylan J. Foster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGB, a process-guided test-time sampling algorithm to address verifier error amplification during autoregressive language model generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seemingly minor errors in learned verifiers can amplify during language model generation, leading to catastrophic failures.

Method: The authors propose VGB, a probabilistic backtracking algorithm inspired by the Sinclair-Jerrum random walk, to improve robustness against verifier errors.

Result: VGB demonstrates superior performance across synthetic and real-world language modeling tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Probabilistic backtracking in test-time sampling can enhance the reliability and quality of language model generation, offsetting verifier inaccuracies.

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

### [255] [Mixture of Many Zero-Compute Experts: A High-Rate Quantization Theory Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03151)
*Yehuda Dar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores mixture-of-experts (MoE) regression models, applying high-rate quantization theory to study test error, segmentation, and expert learning with a focus on the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical insights into MoE models for regression by leveraging high-rate quantization theory to optimize the test error and learning properties while addressing tradeoffs between approximation and estimation errors.

Method: The authors analyzed MoE models where a large number of constant predictor experts (with zero-compute at inference) divide the input space into small regions, using theoretical formulations and empirical analyses of approximation and estimation errors.

Result: Formulated test error metrics and segmentation approaches for one-dimensional inputs, an upper bound for test error in multidimensional inputs, and statistical learning properties of experts. Demonstrated how these errors depend on the number of experts, both theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: The tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning is fundamentally governed by the number of experts, and leveraging this relationship can optimize performance for regression tasks.

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

*Ha Manh Bui,Iliana Maifeld-Carucci,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to improve active learning by focusing on reducing calibration errors, especially for deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of uncalibrated uncertainty in deep neural networks, which impairs the effectiveness of acquisition functions and leads to suboptimal generalization and calibration errors.

Method: The authors propose a novel acquisition function that estimates calibration errors using a kernel calibration error estimator under covariate shift. It prioritizes querying samples with high calibration errors before using model uncertainty.

Result: The proposed method achieves lower calibration and generalization errors compared to other baseline acquisition functions in pool-based active learning scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach improves active learning outcomes by effectively addressing calibration errors, providing a more reliable framework for classifier training.

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

*Irene Tenison,Anna Murphy,Charles Beauville,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FTTE is a new semi-asynchronous Federated Learning framework overcoming challenges like stragglers and resource-constraints. It achieves faster convergence, lower memory usage, and reduced payload, while matching or surpassing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge nodes, along with delays and slow convergence caused by heterogeneous networks. Addressing these issues is critical for scalability.

Method: FTTE uses sparse parameter updates and staleness-weighted aggregation strategies that factor in both age and variance of client updates, aiming to tackle stragglers and resource constraints.

Result: Experiments show FTTE achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower memory usage, and 69% reduced communication payload compared to FedAVG, with comparable or better accuracy against FedBuff.

Conclusion: FTTE provides a scalable and practical solution for deploying Federated Learning on real-world, heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

*Ha Manh Bui,Felix Parker,Kimia Ghobadi,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a shift-aware Q-learning UCB algorithm, Density-QUCB, to address non-stationary reinforcement learning with distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reinforcement learning caused by sudden changes in the environment's transition dynamics, which lead to sub-optimal policies and poor regret performance.

Method: The paper introduces Density-QUCB, an adaptation of Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound (QUCB), using a transition density function to detect shifts and improve uncertainty estimation for better exploration-exploitation balance.

Result: The proposed DQUCB achieves better theoretical regret guarantees compared to QUCB and demonstrates lower regret in empirical RL tasks and a real-world COVID-19 hospital allocation task.

Conclusion: DQUCB is an effective, computationally efficient solution to distribution shifts in RL, performing better than QUCB both theoretically and in practice.

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM-Physics is a benchmark for evaluating physics reasoning with a focus on process-level analysis by representing solutions as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics reasoning benchmarks typically rely on final answer evaluation or heuristic scoring, which fail to capture reasoning processes or ensure reliability.

Method: The paper introduces PRISM-Physics, where solutions are structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) combined with a rule-based validation method for symbolic formula equivalence.

Result: PRISM-Physics demonstrates better alignment with human expert scoring, identifies reasoning failures in state-of-the-art LLMs, and offers diagnostic insights.

Conclusion: PRISM-Physics provides a rigorous framework for advancing evaluation of physics reasoning and guiding model improvement in scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

*André Longon,David Klindt,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how superposition arrangements in neural representations affect alignment metrics used to measure similarity between representations in deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how superposition of features in neural populations might affect the accuracy of representational alignment metrics, which are critical for comparing neural codes.

Method: The authors developed a theory on how permutation metrics depend on superposition arrangements and tested it using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in toy models to disentangle superposition. They also evaluated alignment scores between DNNs and between DNNs and brains.

Result: They show that alignment scores increase when neurons are replaced with sparse overcomplete latent codes, in both toy models and visual domain comparisons between DNNs and brain representations.

Conclusion: Superposition disentanglement is essential for alignment metrics to truly uncover the representational similarity between neural codes.

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

TL;DR: This study uses wearable sensors and machine learning to estimate perceived exertion during single-arm bicep curls, achieving notable accuracy with random forest classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving resistance training feedback and injury prevention by accurately estimating perceived exertion through wearable sensors.

Method: A dataset of 69 sets and over 1000 repetitions was collected, using inertial and electromyography sensors to extract statistical features for model training.

Result: Random forest classifier achieved the highest performance with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% ±1 RPE accuracy. EMG data marginally improved results, with eccentric repetition time identified as a key feature.

Conclusion: Wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation is feasible, but challenges such as data quality and model generalizability remain to be addressed.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

*Yuda Song,Dhruv Rohatgi,Aarti Singh,J. Andrew Bagnell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the trade-offs between privileged expert distillation and standard reinforcement learning (RL) without latent state availability, focusing on empirical and theoretical findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial observability in RL poses challenges in learning complex, history-dependent policies, and there is a need to understand the effectiveness and limitations of privileged expert distillation.

Method: The study uses a theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP and performs controlled experiments on simulated locomotion tasks to analyze the impact of latent dynamics’ stochasticity on policy learning.

Result: Findings reveal that the trade-offs are influenced by latent dynamics' stochasticity, and the best latent policy isn't always optimal for expert distillation.

Conclusion: These results provide insights for leveraging privileged information effectively to improve policy learning efficiency in partially observable domains.

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

### [263] [Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03222)
*Guanhua Huang,Tingqiang Xu,Mingze Wang,Qi Yi,Xue Gong,Siheng Li,Ruibin Xiong,Kejiao Li,Yuhao Jiang,Bo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies issues in RLVR related to loss of exploration due to policy entropy collapse and introduces "Low-probability Regularization" (Lp-Reg) to address these, achieving state-of-the-art performance across math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in RLVR where exploration degrades due to the elimination of low-probability but valuable "reasoning sparks."

Method: The authors propose Lp-Reg, a mechanism that regularizes policy towards a proxy distribution constructed by filtering noise and amplifying low-probability exploratory tokens.

Result: Lp-Reg achieves stable on-policy training for up to 1,000 steps, overcoming entropy collapse and improving average accuracy by 2.66% on five math benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lp-Reg enhances exploration stability and performance in RLVR, proving effective in preserving meaningful exploratory dynamics.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

### [264] [A many-objective evolutionary algorithm using indicator-driven weight vector optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02709)
*Xiaojing Han,Yuanxin Li*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic weight adjustment method using indicators for better optimization of irregular Pareto Fronts (PFs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed weight vectors struggle to optimize irregular Pareto Fronts, leading to non-uniform distributions and poor results.

Method: The study integrates simplified hypervolume and R2 indicators into the MOEA/D framework for dynamic and adaptive weight vector adjustment.

Result: Experimental comparisons with six state-of-the-art algorithms show the proposed method is both efficient and effective.

Conclusion: The adaptive algorithm enhances multi-objective optimization for irregular PFs by ensuring better solution distribution and performance.

Abstract: For regular Pareto Fronts (PFs), such as those that are smooth, continuous,
and uniformly distributed, using fixed weight vectors is sufficient for
multi-objective optimization approaches using decomposition. However, when
encountering irregular PFs-including degenerate, disconnected, inverted, etc.
Fixed weight vectors can often cause a non-uniform distribution of the sets or
even poor optimization results. To address this issue, this study proposes an
adaptive many-objective evolutionary algorithm with a simplified hypervolume
indicator. It synthesizes indicator assessment techniques with
decomposition-based methods to facilitate self-adaptive and dynamic adjustment
of the weight vectors in many-objective optimization methods. Specifically,
based on the MOEA/D framework, it uses a simplified hypervolume indicator to
accurately assess solution distribution. Simultaneously, applying the R2
indicator (as an approximation of hypervolume) dynamically regulates the update
frequency of the weight vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm is efficient and effective when compared with six
state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: An extension of miniKanren called {Kanren} introduces constraints for handling sets and association lists, enabling declarative and lazy programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve expressiveness and operational behavior in programs dealing with abstract data, particularly interpreters.

Method: Implemented {Kanren} with first-class set objects, set-theoretic constraints, and scoped lookup constraints in a constraint-enabled miniKanren system.

Result: {Kanren} enhances declarative programming by supporting lazy evaluations and avoiding eager representations, improving the handling of sets and association lists.

Conclusion: {Kanren} provides a robust tool for symbolic computations, offering new capabilities for abstract data manipulation with better operational behavior.

Abstract: We present {Kanren} (read: set-Kanren), an extension to miniKanren with
constraints for reasoning about sets and association lists. {Kanren} includes
first-class set objects, a functionally complete family of set-theoretic
constraints (including membership, union, and disjointedness), and new
constraints for reasoning about association lists with shadowing and scoped
lookup. These additions allow programmers to describe collections declaratively
and lazily, without relying on structural encodings and eager search over
representation spaces. The result is improved expressiveness and operational
behavior in programs that manipulate abstract data -- particularly interpreters
-- by supporting set equality based on contents, enabling finite failure. We
describe the design and implementation of {Kanren} in a constraint-enabled
miniKanren system and illustrate its use in representative examples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance traditional robot motion planning by leveraging the advantages of XR, including spatial understanding and natural user interaction.

Method: The system incorporates XR capabilities to allow users to reconfigure environments, interact with objects, and visualize robot paths in virtual/augmented reality. It integrates with MoveIt for motion planning.

Result: Users can dynamically define robot paths, verify spatial understanding in immersive environments, and deploy the planned paths on physical robots safely and effectively.

Conclusion: ERUPT combines XR technology with motion planning frameworks for improved visualization, interaction, and real-world robot deployment, promoting safer and more efficient planning workflows.

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot
paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater
spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction
capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment
similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the
scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates
with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion
planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or
augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing
users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot.
Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired
behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions
within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in
the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual driving simulators lack efficiency and flexibility in realistic scenario generation and scene editing.

Method: SIMSplat leverages language-aligned Gaussian scene reconstruction and multi-agent motion prediction for intuitive and detailed editing, supporting direct querying and trajectory modification.

Result: Experiments on the Waymo dataset validate SIMSplat's capability for precise object-level editing and its adaptability to diverse driving scenarios.

Conclusion: SIMSplat offers a robust, language-driven solution for dynamic and realistic driving scene manipulation, enhancing simulation interactivity and realism.

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

*Anamika J H,Anujith Muraleedharan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer to handle perceptual delays and noise in robotic tasks, using UAR-PF for uncertainty-aware adaptation, tested on a benchmark simulating lag and object shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle to operate effectively in dynamic environments with late, noisy, or stale perceptual data. There is a need for robust methods to adapt goals during execution while maintaining performance.

Method: The authors propose U-LAG, featuring a goal-retargeting interface leveraging UAR-PF, which selects goals based on expected task progress amidst delays. They test the system's robustness in synthetic environments simulating lag and object shifts.

Result: Experimental results show UAR-PF improves task success rates, reduces aborts, and maintains stability across various robotic tasks in lag and object shift scenarios.

Conclusion: The integration of U-LAG and UAR-PF demonstrates adaptability and reliability for robots facing perceptual uncertainties, and the framework provides a reproducible benchmark for similar challenges.

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Koopman-based data-driven model predictive control method for mobile robots to efficiently navigate dynamic environments while maintaining collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of achieving computational efficiency in optimal path planning for mobile robots in dynamic environments while accounting for complex nonlinear dynamics and collision constraints.

Method: The authors identify linear and bilinear Koopman models using extended dynamic mode decomposition from input-state data. They employ a bilinear Koopman realization that better captures nonlinear couplings for modeling, and formulate a quadratic program in the lifted space to determine optimal paths using an MPC framework.

Result: The proposed approach in the lifted space computes safe and optimal robot actions 320 times faster than conventional nonlinear MPCs in the original state space.

Conclusion: Bilinear Koopman realizations offer significant computational advantages in solving highly nonlinear path planning problems with state and input constraints, enabling mobile robots to navigate efficiently in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the
linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global
linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC
counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.
Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for
linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear
state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to
linear problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ROV teleoperation suffers from limited sensory feedback and low-resolution visual interfaces, leading to reduced situational awareness in underwater contexts.

Method: Developed SubSense, a VR-Haptic framework with a glove-based setup, providing haptic feedback while integrating camera views into a VR space and managing control inputs.

Result: Experiments and user studies showed enhanced performance, especially in delicate manipulation tasks, compared to traditional interfaces.

Conclusion: Multisensory feedback in VR environments significantly improves situational awareness and mission success for ROV teleoperation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual
environments to significantly improve remote situational awareness and mission
performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in the

TL;DR: The paper introduces UMI-on-Air, a framework for effectively deploying general manipulation policies across different robotic embodiments, using a new technique called Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing the challenge of transferring general manipulation policies trained on unconstrained human demonstrations to constrained robotic embodiments, such as aerial manipulators, which face issues like control mismatch and execution inefficiencies.

Method: The method involves coupling a high-level policy trained on human demonstrations with a low-level embodiment-specific controller, leveraging gradient feedback to adapt trajectories dynamically during test time.

Result: Their approach demonstrated enhanced success rates, efficiency, and robustness in multiple aerial manipulation tasks as compared to baseline diffusion models, and showed adaptability in unseen environments.

Conclusion: The study highlights how UMI-on-Air and its EADP method enable scalable, generalizable, and robust manipulation skills for diverse robotic embodiments, offering a practical approach to deploying human-demonstrated policies in constrained settings.

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly
released after acceptance. Result videos can be found at umi-on-air.github.io.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of visual SLAM methods in dynamic environments, particularly the challenges caused by moving objects.

Method: A modular SLAM framework using deep learning-based semantic segmentation, Enhanced Kalman Filter for idle object identification, and a generative network to restore image regions, implemented in ROS.

Result: Achieves around 22 fps on GTX1080 with competitive localization accuracy on TUM dataset dynamic sequences, comparable with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SLAM system is effective for dynamic environments, improving robustness and real-time performance, and the code is open-sourced to benefit the community.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on
dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach
delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, all while operating in near real-time. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm for trajectory tracking in systems without prior dynamics knowledge, focusing on critical failure cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of abrupt changes in system dynamics within critical failure scenarios.

Method: Algorithm learns dynamics locally via perturbations, calculates reachable states using these dynamics, and synthesizes control actions for navigation.

Result: Demonstrates analytical reachability of waypoints without prior knowledge of system dynamics.

Conclusion: Proposed method enables trajectory tracking even in the absence and abrupt changes in system dynamics.

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a
piecewise linear trajectory without prior knowledge of the system dynamics.
Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

*Qun Yang,Soung Chang Liew*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'hold-and-hit' framework for multi-robot formation navigation using wireless networks, which is robust against delays and packet loss, and demonstrates effectiveness in simulations and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few solutions exist for wireless multi-robot formation navigation on microprocessor platforms, especially for curvilinear paths.

Method: The authors propose a 'hold-and-hit' framework integrated with ROS, synchronizing robot movements via discrete-time cycles and ensuring robustness to network issues alongside intra-cycle optimization for path accuracy.

Result: Their method outperforms existing solutions in simulations and maintains precise formation with minimal positioning and orientation errors in real-world tests along an S-shaped path.

Conclusion: The proposed framework proves effective and reliable for multi-robot formation navigation, addressing wireless and nonholonomic movement challenges.

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

*Jeyoung Park,Yeonsub Lim,Seungeun Oh,Jihong Park,Jinho Choi,Seong-Lyun Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference to enhance latency-sensitive AI applications by enabling selective skipping of server operations, significantly reducing transmission and latency while maintaining high task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high latency in distributed machine learning systems for embodied AI applications, specifically in scenarios like autonomous driving and robot manipulation.

Method: The method involves estimating the need for verification and correction based on action deviation, enabling selective skipping of server operations while ensuring efficient collaborative inference between on-device and server-based models.

Result: Empirical results show a 40% reduction in uplink transmission and server operations, a 33.32% decrease in end-to-end latency, and a task success rate of up to 97.03% compared to inference with only the target model.

Conclusion: The proposed action deviation-aware framework effectively balances transmission rate, inference performance, and latency, showcasing its suitability for latency-sensitive embodied AI applications.

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model

### [278] [A Trajectory Generator for High-Density Traffic and Diverse Agent-Interaction Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02627)
*Ruining Yang,Yi Xu,Yixiao Chen,Yun Fu,Lili Su*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of complex scenarios in trajectory prediction datasets by creating a new framework for generating diverse and high-density driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitation of existing datasets, which focus on low-density and simple driving behaviors, leading to poor model generalization in complex scenarios.

Method: The method converts road environments into a structured grid for detailed planning and introduces behavior-aware trajectory generation mechanisms with rule-based triggers and smoothing techniques.

Result: The proposed framework improves scenario density and diversity while maintaining realism and safety, as shown in experiments on Argoverse datasets.

Conclusion: The framework not only generates better training data but also enhances the performance of trajectory prediction models in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

### [279] [A $1000\times$ Faster LLM-enhanced Algorithm For Path Planning in Large-scale Grid Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02716)
*Junlin Zeng,Xin Zhang,Xiang Zhao,Yan Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces iLLM-A*, an optimized LLM-based algorithm for path planning in large-scale grid maps, achieving significant speed, memory, and path quality improvements over LLM-A*.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing path planning methods struggle with large-scale grid maps due to high computational and memory demands, and current LLM-based approaches still face challenges like spatial illusions and inefficiency.

Method: iLLM-A* is an enhanced algorithm that uses three mechanisms: optimization of A* search, incremental learning for LLM to generate high-quality waypoints, and strategic waypoint selection for efficient path planning.

Result: iLLM-A* achieves over 1000x speedup on average (up to 2349.5x in extreme cases), reduces memory consumption by up to 58.6%, and produces shorter and more consistent path lengths.

Conclusion: iLLM-A* provides a more efficient and accurate solution for large-scale grid map path planning, addressing the limitations of LLM-A* and traditional methods.

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

*Lingfeng Zhang,Erjia Xiao,Yuchen Zhang,Haoxiang Fu,Ruibin Hu,Yanbiao Ma,Wenbo Ding,Long Chen,Hangjun Ye,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces the Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) to improve image retrieval for drone navigation, achieving fine-grained semantic matching between text and images. This approach won TOP-2 in the RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity in achieving fine-grained semantic matching between natural language text queries and visual content for drone navigation, given the challenges in cross-modal, cross-platform operations.

Method: The proposed method, CGRS, uses a two-stage process: firstly, a baseline model performs coarse ranking of the top 20 images. Then, Vision-Language-Model (VLM)-generated captions refine rankings through multimodal similarity calculations.

Result: The approach boosted retrieval performance by 5% in metrics like Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10 compared to the baseline. It achieved the second spot in the RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge.

Conclusion: The CGRS method provides robust fine-grained semantic alignment between text and visuals, proving its practical value for challenging robotic navigation tasks in real-world settings.

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

*Tianyu Li,Yihan Li,Zizhe Zhang,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for improving contact-heavy robotic tasks by introducing force information into vision-based imitation learning and using simulation-based data generated from a single human demonstration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks require handling compliance and force effectively, something that current visuomotor policies often overlook. Introducing force information could help address these challenges.

Method: The researchers generated force-informed simulation data from a single human demonstration and trained a compliant visuomotor policy using this data.

Result: The trained policy demonstrated reliable contact maintenance and adaptability in real-world tasks, such as block flipping and bi-manual object manipulation.

Conclusion: Incorporating force information and simulation-based data generation improves performance in contact-heavy visuomotor robotic tasks, while addressing issues like data scarcity and Sim2Real gaps.

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates Visual Language Models' (VLMs) limitations in trajectory planning for work zones and proposes REACT-Drive, a new framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expand the application of Visual Language Models in autonomous driving to address challenging scenarios, specifically work zones.

Method: Analyzed failure patterns in VLMs and proposed REACT-Drive, which combines VLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for trajectory planning.

Result: REACT-Drive reduces average displacement error by around 3x compared to VLM baselines and achieves the fastest inference time among evaluated methods.

Conclusion: REACT-Drive effectively improves trajectory planning in work zones and demonstrates practicality in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

*Andreas Christou,Elliot Lister,Georgia Andreopoulou,Don Mahad,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a closed-loop Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) controller tailored for managing foot drop, which dynamically adjusts stimulation intensity based on toe clearance. Compared to open-loop systems, it ensures effective toe clearance while reducing muscle fatigue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing open-loop controllers in managing foot drop, which risk overstimulation (causing discomfort and fatigue) or understimulation (compromising safety and mobility).

Method: A novel closed-loop FES controller was developed that adapts stimulation intensity in real-time to toe clearance data. Tests were performed on healthy participants with induced foot drop, comparing this system to traditional open-loop controllers in various walking conditions such as speed and surface inclination.

Result: The closed-loop controller maintained adequate toe clearance without significantly altering hip, knee, and ankle joint angles. Additionally, lower stimulation intensities were required compared to open-loop systems.

Conclusion: The closed-loop system matches the effectiveness of traditional methods while reducing muscle fatigue, offering improved user comfort and potential for long-term adherence.

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

TL;DR: This paper explores using ultra-wideband radar (UWB) for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging in mobile robots to improve environmental mapping under poor visibility conditions and evaluates feature detectors for loop closures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots face challenges with traditional sensors like LiDAR and cameras in adverse visibility conditions, necessitating robust alternatives for perception.

Method: The paper proposes UWB radar-based synthetic aperture radar imaging (SAR), synthesizing a detailed environmental map by moving the radar along the robot's path, and evaluates classical feature detectors such as SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB under simulated adverse conditions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the viability of UWB SAR imaging for creating high-resolution environmental maps and effective loop closure detection under adverse conditions.

Conclusion: UWB SAR imaging is a reliable solution to enhance robotic perception in challenging environments, providing high-resolution mapping and robust detection for improved navigation.

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure autonomous robots navigate effectively and safely in environments populated with static and dynamic obstacles.

Method: Integrates real-time point cloud categorization using Kalman filters for dynamic objects, forward-time-domain mapping, and combines control barrier functions with nonlinear model predictive control for obstacle avoidance.

Result: Validated via simulations and real-world experiments, showcasing superior safety and robustness compared to two baseline methods.

Conclusion: The algorithm demonstrates efficacy in handling complex environments, ensuring effective obstacle avoidance, and contributes to the robotics community by providing source code access.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the relationship between numerical metrics and human-centered assessments in social navigation, finding limitations in current metrics and calling for new standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating social navigation systems for robots, balancing subjective human-centered insights with reproducible numerical metrics.

Method: The study compares existing numerical metrics against human-centered evaluations to identify correlations and determine gaps in current measurement systems.

Result: Findings show that while current metrics capture some aspects of navigation, significant subjective factors are not adequately represented.

Conclusion: Current social navigation metrics need improvement, and new standardized metrics are required for better evaluation of social navigation systems.

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

TL;DR: The paper presents the design and control strategies for a minimal brachiation robot, validating the concepts through simulations and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a minimal, efficient brachiation robot capable of swinging and rotating on a horizontal bar with energy-efficient control.

Method: The robot uses a crank-slide mechanism to reposition its center of mass. Both an optimal bang-bang control strategy and a continuous control strategy are proposed and compared via simulation and experimental validation.

Result: The optimal and continuous control strategies for brachiation motion are successfully validated through simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of using both optimal and continuous control methods for energy-efficient brachiation, advancing robotic locomotion research.

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of lateral motion and control in hover for tail-sitter UAVs by presenting a novel model that uses differential propeller slipstream effects to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tail-sitter UAVs face difficulties in precise lateral modeling and decoupled control during hover due to aerodynamic complexities and undefined lateral dynamics.

Method: A side-slip force model based on differential thrust effects was introduced, and yaw-based lateral control leveraging a YXZ Euler rotation formulation was implemented. Validation was performed via Unity-based trajectory-tracking simulations.

Result: Simulation results on rectangular and circular paths showed stable hover performance with mean absolute position errors and yaw deviations within 5.688 degrees.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively improves lateral dynamics and provides groundwork for creating agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Result: Achieved exceptional RMSE accuracy: 0.00021m in $y$, 0.00041m in $z$, and 0.00024rad in $\theta$, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: The intelligent multi-IMU framework proves highly effective for precise motion estimation in flexible manipulators.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for estimating the position and
orientation of flexible manipulators undergoing vertical motion using multiple
inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth
data. The flexible links are modeled as a series of rigid segments, with joint
angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the
measurements, with its parameters optimized through particle swarm optimization
(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and

Result: The controller demonstrated exceptional trajectory tracking performance in terms of speed and accuracy, surpassing existing NMPC implementations for similar platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed method is a significant advancement, offering improved accuracy and speed over prior nonlinear model-predictive controllers for skid-steered systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a diffusion model-based framework for generating high-coverage trajectories in industrial tasks such as polishing and spray coating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods for trajectory generation are limited in representing complex shapes and generalizing to new tasks, necessitating more flexible and expressive generative models.

Method: The proposed method uses diffusion models with learned noise schedules and conditioning to generate smooth, task-specific trajectories.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms prior methods by improving Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2%, smoothness by 97.0%, and surface coverage by 61%.

Conclusion: Diffusion models provide a versatile and end-to-end solution for trajectory generation in industrial applications, eliminating the need for category-specific models and demonstrating superior performance in generalization and surface coverage.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to
prior methods. The link to our code can be found

Method: The authors developed HumanoidExo, a system minimizing the gap between human demonstrators and robots to translate human motion into comprehensive humanoid data, targeting efficient and scalable dataset collection.

Result: Experiments with HumanoidExo across real-world tasks demonstrated improved generalization to new environments, the learning of complex whole-body controls from minimal demonstrations, and skill acquisition, like walking, solely from this data.

Conclusion: HumanoidExo is essential for enriching humanoid robot datasets, fostering generalization to novel scenarios, and enabling complex skill learning efficiently, proving its value in advancing humanoid robotics.

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

*Yufei Zhu,Andrey Rudenko,Tomasz P. Kucner,Achim J. Lilienthal,Martin Magnusson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on using Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) for improving long-term human motion prediction (LHMP), achieving superior accuracy over learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve long-term human motion prediction for use in autonomous systems, ensuring safety and efficiency in shared spaces with humans.

Method: The authors use MoDs to integrate spatial and temporal motion patterns, proposing a ranking method and a time-conditioned variant for trajectories.

Result: The MoD-based method outperforms learning-based models by up to 50% in average displacement error on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MoD-informed LHMP is effective and accurate, particularly when leveraging the time-conditioned variant for capturing time-based motion dynamics.

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest
accuracy overall. Project code is available at

*Guiliang Liu,Bo Yue,Yi Jin Kim,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper advocates for co-designing both control strategies and physical structures in humanoid robots to improve adaptability and intelligence in various environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots often focus on optimizing control for fixed structures, but there's a need to also adapt their physical morphology to better handle diverse, real-world environments.

Method: The authors propose co-design methodologies inspired by biological evolution, involving strategic exploration, Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning to iteratively evolve robots' form and behavior.

Result: The paper identifies co-design as a promising but underexplored approach, discusses its potential impacts, and presents open research questions for further exploration.

Conclusion: Co-design is a crucial pathway for achieving embodied intelligence and advancing humanoid robotics, requiring a collective effort from the research community to address methodological and implementation challenges.

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

*Chaoxiang Ye,Guido de Croon,Salua Hamaza*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a lightweight whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling obstacle sensing and navigation in visually impaired conditions by mimicking nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny flying robots face challenges navigating in environments with poor lighting or obstructive visuals due to size limitations and reliance on conventional sensors.

Method: The apparatus integrates barometer-based whisker sensors with a tactile depth estimation method and runs on a microcontroller with low computational resources to ensure real-time processing.

Result: The tactile system enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore confined spaces with sub-6 mm accuracy solely through touch, validated by simulations and real-world tests.

Conclusion: This bio-inspired tactile sensing approach enhances vision-free navigation capabilities for tiny drones, offering utility in extreme environments for tasks like search-and-rescue and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

### [296] [Learning Stability Certificate for Robotics in Real-World Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03123)
*Zhe Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method to certify the stability of robotic systems using trajectory data instead of explicit system models, by employing neural networks and Lyapunov functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of deriving stability certificates for complex and unknown robotic systems without explicit system dynamics, which is often difficult and model-dependent.

Method: The authors use neural networks to parameterize Lyapunov functions and enforce positive definiteness via Cholesky factorization. They allow for controlled violations of stability conditions in the presence of noisy real-world data, ensuring high confidence in the certification process.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates its capability to certify stability in unknown systems, even with noisy data, thereby providing robust safety guarantees for robotic systems in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The study offers a data-driven, model-free method to ensure the stability and safety of robotic systems. It is versatile and suitable for opaque or proprietary systems, and the tool is open-sourced for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

*Tianyu Xu,Jiawei Chen,Jiazhao Zhang,Wenyao Zhang,Zekun Qi,Minghan Li,Zhizheng Zhang,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-Nav, a vision-language-action (VLA) model, trained in a teacher-student manner using expert RL data to achieve strong generalization in navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of modeling the optical information in visual observations and to use intelligent models like VLA for navigation tasks in various environments, utilizing synthetic expert data.

Method: The method involves creating MM-Nav, a VLA model incorporating 360-degree visual observations, pre-trained language and visual models, and expert RL data collected in three bespoke environments. The model is trained iteratively while balancing training ratios to improve performance.

Result: Results show that the MM-Nav model generalizes well and surpasses its RL teacher models by integrating multiple navigation capabilities. It performs strongly in both synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: MM-Nav successfully leverages vision, language, and action intelligence to enhance navigation capabilities and proves that the teacher-student approach is effective for training VLA models.

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

*Duanjiao Li,Yun Chen,Ying Zhang,Junwen Yao,Dongyue Huang,Jianguo Zhang,Ning Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a two-stage UAV trajectory planning algorithm for smooth and optimal coverage in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of UAV coverage planning in cluttered power grid environments, enhancing smoothness, time efficiency, and obstacle avoidance.

Method: The method involves using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for initial POI sequences, followed by nonlinear least squares optimization for trajectory refinement.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm the algorithm effectively enables UAVs to navigate cluttered environments while meeting constraints.

Conclusion: The algorithm ensures UAVs achieve smooth and efficient coverage of POIs, balancing constraints like obstacle avoidance and time efficiency.

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

### [299] [Simulation to Rules: A Dual-VLM Framework for Formal Visual Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03182)
*Yilun Hao,Yongchao Chen,Chuchu Fan,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLMFP, a framework using dual Vision Language Models (VLMs) to autonomously generate both PDDL domain and problem files for visual planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Language Models are promising for visual planning but struggle with spatial and long-term reasoning, while PDDL planners excel in formal planning but lack interpretation of visual inputs.

Method: VLMFP employs two VLMs: SimVLM simulates action consequences, and GenVLM generates/refines PDDL files based on SimVLM execution results.

Result: The system generalizes well across unseen instances, appearances, and game rules, achieving high accuracy in describing scenarios and simulating actions and goals.

Conclusion: VLMFP bridges the gap between visual interpretation and formal planning, enabling autonomous and adaptable visual planning across varied domains and challenges.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces Code World Model (CWM), a 32-billion parameter language model optimized for code generation and reasoning using world models. The model is tested on various tasks and detailed results are shared.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance code understanding and reasoning abilities in language models by incorporating concepts from world models and training on real-world agentic code execution environments.

Method: CWM is mid-trained on observation-action trajectories from Python interpreters and Docker environments, followed by multi-task reasoning reinforcement learning. It is a dense, decoder-only LLM with a context size of up to 131k tokens.

Result: CWM achieves high performance on coding and math task benchmarks, with pass@1 scores of 65.8%, 68.6%, 96.6%, and 76.0% on SWE-bench Verified, LiveCodeBench, Math-500, and AIME 2024, respectively. Detailed model checkpoints are shared for further exploration.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that world modeling can significantly improve agentic coding and code reasoning capabilities. The released CWM offers a platform for further research in this interdisciplinary area.

Abstract: We release Code World Model (CWM), a 32-billion-parameter open-weights LLM,
to advance research on code generation with world models. To improve code
understanding beyond what can be learned from training on static code alone, we
mid-train CWM on a large amount of observation-action trajectories from Python
interpreter and agentic Docker environments, and perform extensive multi-task
reasoning RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering
environments. With CWM, we provide a strong testbed for researchers to explore
the opportunities world modeling affords for improving code generation with
reasoning and planning in computational environments. We present first steps of
how world models can benefit agentic coding, enable step-by-step simulation of
Python code execution, and show early results of how reasoning can benefit from
the latter. CWM is a dense, decoder-only LLM trained with a context size of up
to 131k tokens. Independent of its world modeling capabilities, CWM offers
strong performance on general coding and math tasks: it reaches pass@1 scores
of 65.8% on SWE-bench Verified (with test-time scaling), 68.6% on
LiveCodeBench, 96.6% on Math-500, and 76.0% on AIME 2024. To support further
research on code world modeling, we release model checkpoints after

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2L-Agent, an advanced framework that improves line-level vulnerability localization in software using runtime evidence and iterative feedback. It establishes new benchmarks for precise diagnostic evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing large language model-based cybersecurity tools, which focus on coarse function- or file-level vulnerability detection insufficient for real-world precise patching and line-level localization.

Method: The proposed framework, T2L-Agent, analyzes software vulnerabilities using runtime evidence combined with AST-based code chunking. It utilizes iterative feedback via an Agentic Trace Analyzer for refined, precise vulnerability localization.

Result: T2L-Agent performed significantly better than baseline methods on the introduced benchmark T2L-ARVO, achieving up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level localization across diverse, expert-verified cases.

Conclusion: T2L-Agent and the T2L-ARVO benchmark advance LLM-based vulnerability detection, emphasizing precision diagnostics to reduce noise and expedite patching workflows in open-source software development.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet
prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and
focus on coarse function- or file-level detections - offering limited
actionable guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization and
targeted patches in real-world software development. We present T2L-Agent
(Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own
analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable
lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer
(ATA) that fuses runtime evidence - crash points, stack traces, and coverage
deltas - with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond
single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level
diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce
T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash
families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support
both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous
evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On
T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level
localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework
and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification
toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and
accelerate patching in open-source software workflows.

*Jianqing Zhang,Wei Xia,Hande Dong,Qiang Lin,Jian Cao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AP2O-Coder, a method to systematically improve LLMs' code generation by addressing errors adaptively and progressively, achieving better pass@k performance with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in code generation by LLMs, they still produce significant compilation and runtime errors. Existing methods overlook error-specific optimizations by focusing solely on pass/fail signals.

Method: The authors propose AP2O-Coder, a method that builds an error notebook from failed attempts and progressively trains the model to resolve specific error types. Additionally, the approach adaptively replays error types to address the model's evolving weaknesses.

Result: The method demonstrates up to a 3% improvement in pass@k performance across multiple LLMs with different parameter scales, using less preference data than existing methods.

Conclusion: AP2O-Coder effectively improves LLM code generation performance by targeting error-specific optimizations adaptively and progressively, making it efficient and impactful for coding tasks.

Abstract: LLMs' code generation capabilities have yielded substantial improvements in
the effectiveness of programming tasks. However, LLM-generated code still
suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference
optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using
pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error
types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive
Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that
guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code
generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and
progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we
adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses
throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and
general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from
0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in
pass@k while using less preference data. Code: https://github.com/TsingZ0/AP2O

*Siddharth Agarwal,Maria A. Rodriguez,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on resource configuration challenges in serverless computing (FaaS) and proposes a taxonomy to better understand these factors while reviewing the state of the art and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing resource configuration in serverless computing is complex due to platform non-transparency, coupled scaling of resources, and the lack of structured guidance.

Method: The paper identifies key resource configuration factors, analyzes existing literature in this area, and proposes a taxonomy to categorize these factors systematically.

Result: The study reviews current research, identifies research gaps, and provides a framework to analyze resource configuration in FaaS, highlighting areas needing improvement.

Conclusion: The paper sheds light on the need for systematic improvements in resource allocation strategies for FaaS, aiming to streamline developers' task of optimizing cost and performance, which will further enhance serverless computing's adoption.

Abstract: The serverless cloud computing model offers a framework where the service
provider abstracts the underlying infrastructure management from developers. In
this serverless model, FaaS provides an event-driven, function-oriented
computing service characterised by fine-grained, usage-based pricing that
eliminates cost for idle resources. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions,
and Cloud Run Functions require developers to configure their function(s) with
minimum operational resources for its successful execution. This resource
allocation influences both the operational expense and the performance quality
of these functions. However, a noticeable lack of platform transparency forces
developers to rely on expert knowledge or experience-based ad-hoc decisions to
request desired function resources. This makes optimal resource configuration a
non-trivial task while adhering to performance constraints. Furthermore, while
commercial platforms often scale resources like CPU and network bandwidth
proportional to memory, open-source frameworks permit independent configuration
of function resources, introducing additional complexity for developers aiming
to optimise their functions. These complexities have directed researchers to
resolve developer challenges and advance towards an efficient server-less
execution model. In this article, we identify different aspects of resource
configuration techniques in FaaS settings and propose a taxonomy of factors
that influence function design, configuration, run-time cost, and performance
guarantees. We conduct an analysis of existing literature on resource
configuration to present a comprehensive review of current studies on function
configuration. We also identify existing research gaps and suggest future
research directions to enhance function configuration and strengthen the
capabilities of serverless computing environments to drive its broader
adoption.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in understanding how Product Managers' roles are evolving with the integration of GenAI, beyond the focus on software developers.

Method: A mixed-methods study involving surveys of 885 PMs, telemetry analysis for 731 PMs, and interviews with 15 PMs at Microsoft.

Result: Key contributions include insights into PMs' GenAI adoption rates, use cases, challenges, a framework for task delegation, and adaptation practices.

Conclusion: The findings shed light on PMs' evolving roles with GenAI, providing broader implications for GenAI integration into workflows and software development roles.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is changing the nature of knowledge work, particularly
for Product Managers (PMs) in software development teams. While much software
engineering research has focused on developers' interactions with GenAI, there
is less understanding of how the work of PMs is evolving due to GenAI. To
address this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study at Microsoft, a large,
multinational software company: surveying 885 PMs, analyzing telemetry data for
a subset of PMs (N=731), and interviewing a subset of 15 PMs. We contribute:
(1) PMs' current GenAI adoption rates, uses cases, and perceived benefits and
barriers and; (2) a framework capturing how PMs assess which tasks to delegate
to GenAI; (3) PMs adaptation practices for integrating GenAI into their roles
and perceptions of how their role is evolving. We end by discussing
implications on the broader GenAI workflow adoption process and software
development roles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excessive false positives in SAST tools diminish developer trust and demand costly manual triage, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: ZeroFalse enriches static analyzer outputs with flow-sensitive traces, contextual evidence, and CWE-specific knowledge, then uses LLMs for adjudication to preserve coverage while improving accuracy.

Result: The framework reaches high performance with F1-scores of 0.912 on the OWASP Java Benchmark and 0.955 on the OpenVuln dataset, maintaining recall and precision above 90%.

Conclusion: ZeroFalse demonstrates practical scalability and is a promising approach for improving SAST reliability and integration into CI/CD pipelines.

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern
software development, yet their adoption is undermined by excessive false
positives that weaken developer trust and demand costly manual triage. We
present ZeroFalse, a framework that integrates static analysis with large
language models (LLMs) to reduce false positives while preserving coverage.
ZeroFalse treats static analyzer outputs as structured contracts, enriching
them with flow-sensitive traces, contextual evidence, and CWE-specific
knowledge before adjudication by an LLM. This design preserves the systematic
reach of static analysis while leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
We evaluate ZeroFalse across both benchmarks and real-world projects using ten
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our best-performing models achieve F1-scores of 0.912 on
the OWASP Java Benchmark and 0.955 on the OpenVuln dataset, maintaining recall
and precision above 90%. Results further show that CWE-specialized prompting
consistently outperforms generic prompts, and reasoning-oriented LLMs provide
the most reliable precision-recall balance. These findings position ZeroFalse

### [306] [Key Considerations for Auto-Scaling: Lessons from Benchmark Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02585)
*Majid Dashtbani,Ladan Tahvildari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper identifies lifecycle-aware factors affecting auto-scaling in microservice systems, classifies them into architecture, implementation, and deployment phases, and validates findings using benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating autoscaling methods realistically, considering overlooked foundational aspects like design, implementation, and deployment practices.

Method: The authors applied state-of-the-art autoscaling methods to microservice benchmarks like Sock-Shop, classified challenges across software lifecycle stages, and compared diverse autoscaling strategies.

Result: The study demonstrated that disregarding lifecycle considerations degrades autoscaler performance, while addressing these considerations enhances scaling stability and efficiency.

Conclusion: Lifecycle-aware engineering is pivotal for achieving effective and reliable auto-scaling in microservice-based systems.

Abstract: Microservices have become the dominant architectural paradigm for building
scalable and modular cloud-native systems. However, achieving effective
auto-scaling in such systems remains a non-trivial challenge, as it depends not
only on advanced scaling techniques but also on sound design, implementation,
and deployment practices. Yet, these foundational aspects are often overlooked
in existing benchmarks, making it difficult to evaluate autoscaling methods
under realistic conditions. In this paper, we identify a set of practical
auto-scaling considerations by applying several state-of-the-art autoscaling
methods to widely used microservice benchmarks. To structure these findings, we
classify the issues based on when they arise during the software lifecycle:
Architecture, Implementation, and Deployment. The Architecture phase covers
high-level decisions such as service decomposition and inter-service
dependencies. The Implementation phase includes aspects like initialization
overhead, metrics instrumentation, and error propagation. The Deployment phase
focuses on runtime configurations such as resource limits and health checks. We
validate these considerations using the Sock-Shop benchmark and evaluate
diverse auto-scaling strategies, including threshold-based, control-theoretic,
learning-based, black-box optimization, and dependency-aware approaches. Our
findings show that overlooking key lifecycle concerns can degrade autoscaler
performance, while addressing them leads to more stable and efficient scaling.
These results underscore the importance of lifecycle-aware engineering for
unlocking the full potential of auto-scaling in microservice-based systems.

*Chengquan Guo,Chulin Xie,Yu Yang,Zhaorun Chen,Zinan Lin,Xander Davies,Yarin Gal,Dawn Song,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RedCodeAgent, an automated red-teaming tool for identifying vulnerabilities in code agents. It utilizes an adaptive memory module and sandbox environments for systematic safety assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the growing security risks associated with code agents that integrate interpreters for dynamic execution, which are not effectively addressed by current static benchmarks and red-teaming tools.

Method: RedCodeAgent utilizes an adaptive memory module to select optimized combinations of jailbreak tools. It evaluates code agents' vulnerabilities in sandbox environments to avoid biases from static code evaluations.

Result: RedCodeAgent outperforms existing tools in identifying vulnerabilities, with higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates across diverse scenarios, languages, and code agents.

Conclusion: RedCodeAgent enhances the safety assessment of code agents by systematically automating and optimizing the red-teaming process, enabling scalable and effective evaluations of security risks.

Abstract: Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code
generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling
dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While
these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also
introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks
and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky
scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the
combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose
RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically
uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module,
RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the
most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox
for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise
be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox
environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents,
mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code.
Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents,
diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent
consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack
success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further
validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium,
exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing
red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective
safety assessments of code agents.

### [308] [Automatic Building Code Review: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02634)
*Hanlong Wan,Weili Xu,Michael Rosenberg,Jian Zhang,Aysha Siddika*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study proposes an agent-driven framework integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated code reviews (ACR), showcasing enhanced scalability and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building officials often struggle with labor-intensive and error-prone manual reviews of complex design documents, which are costly and inefficient, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Method: The authors developed an agent-driven framework combining BIM-based data extraction with LLM-powered automated verification using RAG and MCP agent pipelines.

Result: Case demonstrations showed successful automated extraction of geometric attributes, schedule parsing, and code validation with GPT-4o outperforming smaller models in efficiency and stability.

Conclusion: This framework enhances ACR research by offering a scalable, interoperable, and production-ready solution that integrates BIM with authoritative code review systems.

Abstract: Building officials, particularly those in resource-constrained or rural
jurisdictions, face labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly manual reviews of
design documents as projects increase in size and complexity. The growing
adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents opportunities for automated code review (ACR) solutions. This
study introduces a novel agent-driven framework that integrates BIM-based data
extraction with automated verification using both retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent pipelines. The
framework employs LLM-enabled agents to extract geometry, schedules, and system
attributes from heterogeneous file types, which are then processed for building
code checking through two complementary mechanisms: (1) direct API calls to the
US Department of Energy COMcheck engine, providing deterministic and
audit-ready outputs, and (2) RAG-based reasoning over rule provisions, enabling
flexible interpretation where coverage is incomplete or ambiguous.
  The framework was evaluated through case demonstrations, including automated
extraction of geometric attributes (such as surface area, tilt, and insulation
values), parsing of operational schedules, and validation of lighting
allowances under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2022. Comparative performance tests
across multiple LLMs showed that GPT-4o achieved the best balance of efficiency
and stability, while smaller models exhibited inconsistencies or failures.
Results confirm that MCP agent pipelines outperform RAG reasoning pipelines in
rigor and reliability. This work advances ACR research by demonstrating a
scalable, interoperable, and production-ready approach that bridges BIM with
authoritative code review tools.

### [309] [Using Fourier Analysis and Mutant Clustering to Accelerate DNN Mutation Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02718)
*Ali Ghanbari,Sasan Tavakkol*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes DM#, a Fourier analysis-based method to accelerate DNN mutation testing by clustering mutants and testing representatives, reducing time and error compared to baseline techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the high computational cost of DNN mutation analysis caused by the need to test a large number of mutants on extensive datasets.

Method: The method involves applying Fourier analysis to quantify mutant behavior, clustering similar mutants, and testing only a representative from each cluster to infer results for the entire group.

Result: DM# achieves a 28.38% average acceleration in mutation testing, with only a 0.72% mutation score error. It outperforms random selection, boundary sample selection, and random sample selection in terms of error while maintaining comparable speed-up.

Conclusion: DM# effectively accelerates DNN mutation testing with minimal error, making it a more efficient and reliable alternative to existing techniques.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) mutation analysis is a promising approach to
evaluating test set adequacy. Due to the large number of generated mutants that
must be tested on large datasets, mutation analysis is costly. In this paper,
we present a technique, named DM#, for accelerating DNN mutation testing using
Fourier analysis. The key insight is that DNN outputs are real-valued functions
suitable for Fourier analysis that can be leveraged to quantify mutant behavior
using only a few data points. DM# uses the quantified mutant behavior to
cluster the mutants so that the ones with similar behavior fall into the same
group. A representative from each group is then selected for testing, and the
result of the test, e.g., whether the mutant is killed or survived, is reused
for all other mutants represented by the selected mutant, obviating the need
for testing other mutants. 14 DNN models of sizes ranging from thousands to
millions of parameters, trained on different datasets, are used to evaluate DM#
and compare it to several baseline techniques. Our results provide empirical
evidence on the effectiveness of DM# in accelerating mutation testing by
28.38%, on average, at the average cost of only 0.72% error in mutation score.
Moreover, on average, DM# incurs 11.78, 15.16, and 114.36 times less mutation
score error compared to random mutant selection, boundary sample selection, and
random sample selection techniques, respectively, while generally offering
comparable speed-up.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AuthFix, an automated OpenID bug repair system using large language models and a Petri-net model checker, achieves 74% accuracy on fixing OpenID bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OpenID Connect's critical security vulnerabilities have resulted in financial losses and breaches, driving the need for automated repair methods.

Method: AuthFix employs counterexample-guided repair leveraging LLMs, integrating fault localization, patch synthesis, and patch verification with a novel Petri-net-based model checker.

Result: AuthFix successfully repaired 17 out of 23 OpenID bugs (74%), with many patches matching developer-authored fixes.

Conclusion: AuthFix represents a significant advance in automated bug repair, highlighting its potential for enhancing OpenID Connect system security.

Abstract: OpenID Connect has revolutionized online authentication based on single
sign-on (SSO) by providing a secure and convenient method for accessing
multiple services with a single set of credentials. Despite its widespread
adoption, critical security bugs in OpenID Connect have resulted in significant
financial losses and security breaches, highlighting the need for robust
mitigation strategies. Automated program repair presents a promising solution
for generating candidate patches for OpenID implementations. However,
challenges such as domain-specific complexities and the necessity for precise
fault localization and patch verification must be addressed. We propose
AuthFix, a counterexample-guided repair engine leveraging LLMs for automated
OpenID bug fixing. AuthFix integrates three key components: fault localization,
patch synthesis, and patch verification. By employing a novel Petri-net-based
model checker, AuthFix ensures the correctness of patches by effectively
modeling interactions. Our evaluation on a dataset of OpenID bugs demonstrates
that AuthFix successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs
(74%), with a high proportion of patches semantically equivalent to
developer-written fixes.

### [311] [C2|Q>: A Robust Framework for Bridging Classical and Quantum Software Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02854)
*Boshuai Ye,Arif Ali Khan,Teemu Pihkakoski,Peng Liang,Muhammad Azeem Akbar,Matti Silveri,Lauri Malmi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: C2|Q>: is a novel framework simplifying quantum software development by encoding classical code into quantum programs and providing hardware-agnostic solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the complexity faced by classical software engineers in quantum development, which requires intricate handling of low-level details in the quantum software stack.

Method: C2|Q>: breaks the development process into three modules: encoder for problem classification and circuit construction, deployment for hardware recommendation, and decoder for translating quantum outputs back to classical formats.

Result: The framework demonstrated high completion rates (93.8% and 100%) in processing specifications, and reduced implementation effort by ~40X in case studies compared to manual methods.

Conclusion: C2|Q>: makes quantum software engineering more accessible by minimizing manual effort and automating essential quantum software tasks, paving the way for broader adoption among developers.

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging as a critical discipline to
make quantum computing accessible to a broader developer community; however,
most quantum development environments still require developers to engage with
low-level details across the software stack - including problem encoding,
circuit construction, algorithm configuration, hardware selection, and result
interpretation - making them difficult for classical software engineers to use.
To bridge this gap, we present C2|Q>: a hardware-agnostic quantum software
development framework that translates classical specifications (code) into
quantum-executable programs while preserving methodological rigor. The
framework applies modular software engineering principles by classifying the
workflow into three core modules: an encoder that classifies problems, produces
Quantum-Compatible Formats (QCFs), and constructs quantum circuits, a
deployment module that generates circuits and recommends hardware based on
fidelity, runtime, and cost, and a decoder that interprets quantum outputs into
classical solutions. In evaluation, the encoder module achieved a 93.8%
completion rate, the hardware recommendation module consistently selected the
appropriate quantum devices for workloads scaling up to 56 qubits, and the full
C2|Q>: workflow successfully processed classical specifications (434 Python
snippets and 100 JSON inputs) with completion rates of 93.8% and 100%,
respectively. For case study problems executed on publicly available NISQ
hardware, C2|Q>: reduced the required implementation effort by nearly 40X
compared to manual implementations using low-level quantum software development
kits (SDKs), with empirical runs limited to small- and medium-sized instances
consistent with current NISQ capabilities. The open-source implementation of
C2|Q>: is available at https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q

*Zhao Zhang,Qingyuan Liang,Zeyu Sun,Yizhou Chen,Guoqing Wang,Yican Sun,Lu Zhang,Ge Li,Yingfei Xiong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of code representation choices on model performance by analyzing the relationship between parsing difficulty and effectiveness. The proposed GramTrans method automates representation transformation to improve parsing simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored question of how parsing difficulty in different code representations affects model performance, aiming for tools that enhance software development.

Method: Formalize the relationship between parsing difficulty and model performance using grammar classes, conduct controlled experiments, and introduce GramTrans—a method for transforming representations into simpler grammar classes.

Result: GramTrans improves code generation model performance across benchmarks for Python and Java. It aligns parsing simplicity with model effectiveness and yields significant advancements over baseline methods.

Conclusion: Simpler, easier-to-parse code representations enhance model effectiveness, as corroborated by the GramTrans approach and its consistent performance improvements in controlled experiments.

Abstract: Code generation has shown great promise in assisting software development. A
fundamental yet underexplored question is how the choice of code representation
affects model performance. While existing studies employ various
representations, such as treating code as plain text, grammar rule sequences,
or syntax tree sequences, they lack a principled understanding of the
relationship between parsing difficulty and model effectiveness. This paper
proposes a conjecture: the easier a representation is to parse, the better
performance the model achieves. We formalize this idea using grammar classes,
where representations in simpler classes (e.g., LL(1)) are easier to parse.
Through a controlled experiment on a Python-based DSL, we show that parsing
difficulty strongly correlates with model performance. Motivated by this
finding, we present GramTrans, a general approach that automatically transforms
a context-free language into a representation within the LL(1) class. GramTrans
introduces a novel hierarchical conflict elimination algorithm, enabling a
flexible trade-off between syntactic simplicity and token efficiency. We
evaluate GramTrans on both Python and Java using three code generation models:
StarCoder 1B, DeepSeek-Coder 1.3B, and Qwen2.5 1.5B. Across multiple
benchmarks, GramTrans consistently delivers significant improvements over
baseline representations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing representations
reconfirms the strong alignment between parsing difficulty and model
performance, providing additional support for the conjecture.

### [313] [Mechanistic Interpretability of Code Correctness in LLMs via Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02917)
*Kriz Tahimic,Charibeth Cheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) encode code correctness, employing sparse autoencoders to identify key directions and provide practical strategies for error prediction and correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising prevalence of AI-suggested code in production highlights the need to understand how LLMs internally assess code correctness to ensure safe deployment.

Method: Sparse autoencoders are used to decompose LLM representations, identifying predictive and steering directions using statistical techniques like t-statistics and separation scores. Mechanistic properties are analyzed through attention patterns and orthogonalization.

Result: Key directions in LLM representations reliably predict code errors. Correction actions trade off between fixing errors and preserving correct code. Insights reveal that successful code generation depends more on test case processing than problem descriptions.

Conclusion: Directions related to code correctness learned during pre-training are effectively repurposed during fine-tuning. Practical applications include better prompting strategies, error alarms, and selective steering for safer and more precise code generation.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become integral to software development, with
substantial portions of AI-suggested code entering production, understanding
their internal correctness mechanisms becomes critical for safe deployment. We
apply sparse autoencoders to decompose LLM representations, identifying
directions that correspond to code correctness. We select predictor directions
using t-statistics and steering directions through separation scores from base
model representations, then analyze their mechanistic properties through
steering, attention analysis, and weight orthogonalization. We find that code
correctness directions in LLMs reliably predict incorrect code, while
correction capabilities, though statistically significant, involve tradeoffs
between fixing errors and preserving correct code. Mechanistically, successful
code generation depends on attending to test cases rather than problem
descriptions. Moreover, directions identified in base models retain their
effectiveness after instruction-tuning, suggesting code correctness mechanisms
learned during pre-training are repurposed during fine-tuning. Our mechanistic
insights suggest three practical applications: prompting strategies should
prioritize test examples over elaborate problem descriptions, predictor
directions can serve as error alarms for developer review, and these same
predictors can guide selective steering, intervening only when errors are
anticipated to prevent the code corruption from constant steering.

TL;DR: AUTOPROBE is a novel model-agnostic framework that enhances code correctness assessment for LLM-generated code by dynamically selecting optimal internal signals. Experimental results show significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical issue of ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code, especially given the limitations of existing fixed-layer and token-based representation methods.

Method: AUTOPROBE uses an attention-based mechanism to dynamically select and weigh the most relevant hidden states of LLMs, leveraging this information with a probing classifier to assess code correctness across compilability, functionality, and security.

Result: AUTOPROBE demonstrated significant improvements across benchmarks, outperforming baselines by 18% in security assessment, up to 19% in compilability, and up to 111% in functionality assessment.

Conclusion: Dynamic selection of informative internal signals in LLMs enables AUTOPROBE to provide a robust and generalizable approach for code correctness assessment, showcasing superior performance across various challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation and are increasingly integrated into the software development
process. However, ensuring the correctness of LLM-generated code remains a
critical concern. Prior work has shown that the internal representations of
LLMs encode meaningful signals for assessing code correctness. Nevertheless,
the existing methods rely on representations from pre-selected/fixed layers and
token positions, which could limit its generalizability across diverse model
architectures and tasks. In this work, we introduce AUTOPROBE, a novel
model-agnostic approach that dynamically selects the most informative internal
representations for code correctness assessment. AUTOPROBE employs an
attention-based mechanism to learn importance scores for hidden states,
enabling it to focus on the most relevant features. These weighted
representations are then aggregated and passed to a probing classifier to
predict code correctness across multiple dimensions, including compilability,
functionality, and security. To evaluate the performance of AUTOPROBE, we
conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and code LLMs. Our
experimental results show that AUTOPROBE consistently outperforms the
baselines. For security assessment, AUTOPROBE surpasses the state-of-the-art
white-box approach by 18%. For compilability and functionality assessment,
AUTOPROBE demonstrates its highest robustness to code complexity, with the
performance higher than the other approaches by up to 19% and 111%,
respectively. These findings highlight that dynamically selecting important
internal signals enables AUTOPROBE to serve as a robust and generalizable
solution for assessing the correctness of code generated by various LLMs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses three design patterns to enhance observability of cloud-native applications: Distributed Tracing, Application Metrics, and Infrastructure Metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of diagnosing system issues in increasingly distributed and dynamic cloud-native applications.

Method: The authors introduce three design patterns—Distributed Tracing, Application Metrics, and Infrastructure Metrics—based on industry practices and frameworks.

Result: These patterns improve latency analysis, performance monitoring, resource utilization assessment, and anomaly detection across cloud-native systems.

Conclusion: Implementing these patterns can enhance reliability, scalability, and maintainability of cloud-native applications.

Abstract: Observability helps ensure the reliability and maintainability of
cloud-native applications. As software architectures become increasingly
distributed and subject to change, it becomes a greater challenge to diagnose
system issues effectively, often having to deal with fragmented observability
and more difficult root cause analysis. This paper builds upon our previous
work and introduces three design patterns that address key challenges in
monitoring cloud-native applications. Distributed Tracing improves visibility
into request flows across services, aiding in latency analysis and root cause
detection, Application Metrics provides a structured approach to instrumenting
applications with meaningful performance indicators, enabling real-time
monitoring and anomaly detection, and Infrastructure Metrics focuses on
monitoring the environment in which the system is operated, helping teams
assess resource utilization, scalability, and operational health. These
patterns are derived from industry practices and observability frameworks and
aim to offer guidance for software practitioners.

TL;DR: This study introduces a pattern language for teaching Agile Software Development (ASD) in higher education, based on authors' teaching experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the popularity of ASD in the industry, current literature lacks actionable teaching guidance for its classroom application.

Method: The authors propose five teaching-focused patterns: Capping Team Size, Smaller Project Scope, Business Non-Critical Project, Self-assembling Teams, and Team Chooses Topic.

Result: The proposed teaching patterns focus on team and project setup phases in ASD education to better equip university students.

Conclusion: These patterns aim to provide a foundational framework for educators to effectively teach ASD practices in a higher education setting.

Abstract: Higher education courses teaching about agile software development (ASD) have
increased in commonality as the ideas behind the Agile Manifesto became more
commonplace in the industry. However, a lot of the literature on how ASD is
applied in the classroom does not provide much actionable advice, focusing on
frameworks or even moving beyond the software development area into teaching in
an agile way. We, therefore, showcase early work on a pattern language that
focuses on teaching ASD practices to university students, which stems from our
own experiences as educators in higher education contexts. We present five
patterns, specifically focused on team and project setup phase: Capping Team
Size, Smaller Project Scope, Business Non-Critical Project, Self-assembling
Teams, and Team Chooses Topic as a starting point for developing the overall
pattern language.

*Debalina Ghosh Paul,Hong Zhu,Ian Bayley*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLM-generated code quality using code smells as indicators. LLMs show higher incidence of smells compared to human-written code, especially in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored area of code quality in LLM-generated programs, using a scenario-based evaluation to identify critical weaknesses.

Method: Researchers measured code smells in LLM-generated Java programs and compared them with professional references across different topics and complexities. An automated test system facilitated the experiments.

Result: LLM-generated code showed significantly higher code smells. Falcon performed best, followed by Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, and Codex, with average smell increases observed at 63.34%. Complex tasks amplified smell issues.

Conclusion: LLM-generated code is less quality-driven than human-written programs, especially in handling complex tasks and topics. More improvement is needed to align with professional standards.

Abstract: Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate
program code. Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of
generated code, but there is far less on code quality.
  Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating
the quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which
the quality of LLM generated code should be improved.
  Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code
quality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of
professionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets
according to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to
represent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also
present an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with
the Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four
state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.
  Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code
smells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with
a smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%)
and finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was
63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design
smells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more
complex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving
object-orientated concepts.
  Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding
task complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human
written code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM
generated code is noticeably poorer than human written code.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper creates a catalog of seven code-level refactorings that streamline transitioning from monolithic systems to microservices by managing dependencies efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face challenges transitioning to microservices, as current methods largely ignore code-level issues while focusing on architecture-level strategies.

Method: The paper provides a guided catalog of seven refactorings, consolidating and systematizing existing strategies at the code level.

Result: Developers gain a structured, step-by-step guide to handle dependencies effectively during migration to microservices.

Conclusion: The catalog simplifies the migration process and paves the way for automation, addressing the gap in code-level systematization of microservices migration.

Abstract: As organizations increasingly transition from monolithic systems to
microservices, they aim to achieve higher availability, automatic scaling,
simplified infrastructure management, enhanced collaboration, and streamlined
deployments. However, this migration process remains largely manual and
labour-intensive. While existing literature offers various strategies for
decomposing monoliths, these approaches primarily focus on architecture-level
guidance, often overlooking the code-level challenges and dependencies that
developers must address during the migration. This article introduces a
catalogue of seven refactorings specifically designed to support the transition
to a microservices architecture with a focus on handling dependencies. The
catalogue provides developers with a systematic guide that consolidates
refactorings identified in the literature and addresses the critical gap in
systematizing the process at the code level. By offering a structured,
step-by-step approach, this work simplifies the migration process and lays the
groundwork for its potential automation, empowering developers to implement
these changes efficiently and effectively.

### [319] [State Field Coverage: A Metric for Oracle Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03071)
*Facundo Molina,Nazareno Aguirre,Alessandra Gorla*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel metric, state field coverage, for assessing the quality of software testing oracles. This metric evaluates the proportion of object states inspected during tests to determine oracle effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing metrics for evaluating test oracle quality, aiming to improve fault detection in software testing by introducing a more comprehensive and generalizable approach.

Method: The authors propose the state field coverage metric, which statically measures the extent of state fields accessed by test oracles. They implement a static computation mechanism and evaluate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments analyzing invariants and test assertions.

Result: Experiments show a strong correlation between state field coverage and oracles' fault detection capabilities, highlighting its usefulness in improving oracle quality.

Conclusion: State field coverage proves to be an efficient and effective metric for assessing and improving the ability of testing oracles to detect software faults.

Abstract: The effectiveness of testing in uncovering software defects depends not only
on the characteristics of the test inputs and how thoroughly they exercise the
software, but also on the quality of the oracles used to determine whether the
software behaves as expected. Therefore, assessing the quality of oracles is
crucial to improve the overall effectiveness of the testing process. Existing
metrics have been used for this purpose, but they either fail to provide a
comprehensive basis for guiding oracle improvement, or they are tailored to
specific types of oracles, thus limiting their generality.
  In this paper, we introduce state field coverage, a novel metric for
assessing oracle quality. This metric measures the proportion of an object's
state, as statically defined by its class fields, that an oracle may access
during test execution. The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a
higher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software
under analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to
determine whether tests pass or not.
  We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage
metric. Being statically computed, the metric is efficient and provides direct
guidance for improving test oracles by identifying state fields that remain
unexamined. We evaluate state field coverage through experiments involving 273
representation invariants and 249,027 test assertions. The results show that
state field coverage is a well-suited metric for assessing oracle quality, as
it strongly correlates with the oracles' fault-detection ability, measured by
mutation score.

### [320] [When Names Disappear: Revealing What LLMs Actually Understand About Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03178)
*Cuong Chi Le,Minh V. T. Pham,Cuong Duc Van,Hoang N. Phan,Huy N. Phan,Tien N. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) derive meaning from code and emphasizes two communication channels: structural semantics and naming conventions. By using obfuscation, it reveals limitations in LLMs' semantic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs genuinely understand code semantics or rely on memorizing naming patterns.

Method: Introduced obfuscation techniques to test code understanding by suppressing naming conventions while preserving behavior. The authors also developed ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark.

Result: The experiments revealed that removing naming cues degrades performance on intent-driven tasks and even affects execution-based tasks. The proposed approach mitigated inflated performance caused by memorization.

Conclusion: ClassEval-Obf provides a more accurate evaluation of LLMs' ability to understand, generalize, and reason semantically about code.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how
they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates
through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and
human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel
severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models
regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent
reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing
that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than
genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite
of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier
leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we
release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically
suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that
ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization
shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code
understanding and generalization.

### [321] [Abstain and Validate: A Dual-LLM Policy for Reducing Noise in Agentic Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03217)
*José Cambronero,Michele Tufano,Sherry Shi,Renyao Wei,Grant Uy,Runxiang Cheng,Chin-Jung Liu,Shiying Pan,Satish Chandra,Pat Rondon*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces two policies that reduce the noise caused by unlikely agent-generated patches in automated program repair, improving success rates and paving the way for industrial-scale APR application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineer-level automated program repair systems often produce patches that still require human review. This paper aims to mitigate developer distrust and improve efficiency by filtering out unlikely fixes.

Method: The researchers propose two LLM-based policies: bug abstention (excluding bugs unlikely to be fixed) and patch validation (rejecting patches unlikely to fix the given bug). They evaluated the policies on Google's codebase using human-reported and machine-generated bug reports.

Result: Applying these policies on 174 human-reported bugs improved patch success rates by up to 39 percentage points in combination. Patch validation also enhanced success rates for machine-generated bugs.

Conclusion: The proposed policies enable more reliable deployment of automated program repair systems at industrial scale, reducing developer review workload and enhancing trust in automated code suggestions.

Abstract: Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex,
repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still
need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address
the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise,
wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We
introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug
abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the
agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that
are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on
three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches
generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported
bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise
success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points,
respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer
exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports,
patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This
two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale
deployment of agentic APR systems.

*Sanna Bakels,Mark van de Ruit,Matin Jafarian*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper uses EEG data and subspace identification methods to model brain cortical dynamics induced by wrist perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a linear time-invariant model that connects brain cortical responses to continuous external inputs, derived from EEG data.

Method: The PO-MOESP subspace identification algorithm is applied to EEG data collected during wrist perturbation experiments, constructing latent space models and mapping them to neural source dynamics.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates consistent accuracy across seven participants and aligns with previous studies.

Conclusion: The study successfully establishes a reliable linear mathematical model for brain cortical dynamics that connects EEG outputs with external stimuli.

Abstract: This paper studies linear mathematical modeling of brain's cortical dynamics
using electroencephalography (EEG) data in an experiment with continuous
exogenous input. The EEG data were recorded while participants were seated with
their wrist strapped to a haptic manipulator. The manipulator imposed a
continuous multisine angular perturbation to the wrist as the exogenous input
to the brain. We show that subspace identification, in particular the PO-MOESP
algorithm, leads to a linear time-invariant state-space model that accurately
represents the measurements, in a latent space, assuming that the EEG data are
the models' output. The model is verified and validated using data from seven
participants. Moreover, we construct linear maps to relate the latent space
dynamics to the neural source space. We show that findings by our model align
with those identified in previous studies.

### [323] [Pyk2 plays a critical role in synaptic dysfunction during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02824)
*Quentin Rodriguez,Floriane Payet,Karina Vargas-Baron,Eve Borel,Fabien Lanté,Sylvie Boisseau,Béatrice Blot,Jean-Antoine Girault,Alain Buisson*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study uncovers Pyk2's role in Alzheimer's disease, linking it to neuronal hyperactivity, synaptic loss, and Tau phosphorylation, suggesting it as a therapeutic target.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the unclear role of Pyk2, a tyrosine kinase linked to Alzheimer's disease, in early neurodegenerative processes like neuronal hyperactivity, synaptic loss, and Tau pathologies.

Method: Using Pyk2 knockout mice, cultured neurons, fluorescence assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and kinase assays to investigate Pyk2's involvement in key Alzheimer's markers like synaptic changes and Tau interactions.

Result: Pyk2 deletion prevented amyloid-$\beta$-induced neuronal hyperactivity and synaptic loss; Pyk2 phosphorylated Tau and affected its synaptic localization, linking it to disease pathology.

Conclusion: Pyk2 is a significant contributor to early changes in Alzheimer's disease, and targeting it might offer therapeutic interventions for mitigating disease progression.

Abstract: Background: The locus of the gene PTK2B encoding the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 has
been associated with the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the
predominant form of dementia. Pyk2 is primarily expressed in neurons where it
is involved in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic functions. Although
previous studies have implicated Pyk2 in amyloid-$\beta$ and Tau pathologies of
Alzheimer's disease, its exact role remains unresolved, with evidence showing
both detrimental and protective effects in mouse models. Here, we investigate
the role of Pyk2 in hippocampal hyperactivity, Tau phosphorylation and synaptic
loss associated with Alzheimer's disease-related alterations occurring in the
early stages of the disease. Methods: Pyk2's involvement in amyloid-$\beta$
oligomer-induced hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity was investigated using
whole cell patch-clamp in hippocampal slices from WT and Pyk2 KO mice. Various
Pyk2 mutants were overexpressed in cultured cortical neurons to study Pyk2's
role in synaptic loss. Pyk2 and Tau interaction was assessed with bimolecular
fluorescence complementation assays in cultured neurons and
co-immunoprecipitation in mouse cortex. Pyk2's ability to directly
phosphorylate Tau was determined using in vitro kinase assays. To evaluate the
impact of Pyk2 on Tau expression and phosphorylation in synapses, cellular
fractionation was performed on hippocampi from WT and Pyk2 KO mice. Results:
Genetic deletion of Pyk2 prevented amyloid-$\beta$ oligomer-induced hippocampal
neuronal hyperactivity and synaptic loss. Overexpression of Pyk2 in neurons
decreased dendritic spine density independently of its autophosphorylation or
kinase activity, but through its proline-rich motif 1. Furthermore, Pyk2
interacted with Tau in synapses and directly phosphorylated it at Tyr18 in
vitro, while Pyk2 deletion decreased Tau phosphorylation at Thr181 and its
synaptic localization in the hippocampus. Conclusions: Pyk2 contributes to
hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity and synaptic loss, two early events in
Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. It is also involved in Tau synaptic
localization and phosphorylation, processes known to be detrimental in
Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight Pyk2 as a critical player in
Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and suggest its potential as a promising
therapeutic target for early intervention.

*Maoshen Xu,Fei Song,Yuxiu Shao,Bailu Si,Shanshan Qin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces the Principle of Isomorphism (PIso), linking neural population activity to the underlying mathematical structures of tasks. Using grid cells, they show how task constraints direct neural topologies, uniting perspectives in Euclidean space and developing a minimal network to model these features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the principles that govern neural population activity is a critical challenge in neuroscience. The research seeks to identify core mathematical structures underlying this activity, thus bridging the gap between computational tasks and neural organization.

Method: The authors use theoretical and mathematical tools to characterize tasks (e.g., path integration or neural metrics) with geometric principles (flat Riemannian manifolds, Abelian Lie groups). They develop a minimal network architecture to explore how toroidal topology informs single-cell firing patterns, analyzing parameter relationships and hexagonal field formation.

Result: The study demonstrates that task-specific constraints lead to toroidal topologies in grid cells and that these constraints unify seamlessly in Euclidean space. They also find that conformal isometry alone cannot drive hexagonal patterns, which are tied to computational tasks.

Conclusion: The findings provide a general principle (PIso) connecting neural computation to mathematical structures, offering insights for neuroscience and task-informed machine learning architectures. This framework deepens understanding of grid cell organization and its relation to computational tasks.

Abstract: Identifying the principles that determine neural population activity is
paramount in the field of neuroscience. We propose the Principle of Isomorphism
(PIso): population activity preserves the essential mathematical structures of
the tasks it supports. Using grid cells as a model system, we show that the
neural metric task is characterized by a flat Riemannian manifold, while path
integration is characterized by an Abelian Lie group. We prove that each task
independently constrains population activity to a toroidal topology. We further
show that these perspectives are unified naturally in Euclidean space, where
commutativity and flatness are intrinsically compatible and can be extended to
related systems including head-direction cells and 3D grid cells. To examine
how toroidal topology maps onto single-cell firing patterns, we develop a
minimal network architecture that explicitly constrains population activity to
toroidal manifolds. Our model robustly generates hexagonal firing fields and
reveals systematic relationships between network parameters and grid spacings.
Crucially, we demonstrate that conformal isometry, a commonly proposed
hypothesis, alone is insufficient for hexagonal field formation. Our findings
establish a direct link between computational tasks and the hexagonal-toroidal
organization of grid cells, thereby providing a general framework for
understanding population activity in neural systems and designing task-informed
architectures in machine learning.

*Mahya Beheshti,Todd E Hudson,Rajvardhan Gadde,Glenn Alvarez Arias,Karis Huh,Robert L Sainburg,JR Rizzo*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates how stroke impacts eye-hand coordination, focusing on saccade timing and reach accuracy, and highlights potential rehabilitation directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how stroke affects temporal coupling between eye (saccade) and hand (reach) movements which are vital for coordinated, goal-directed actions.

Method: The study employed a comparative eye-tracking setup, using Kinereach with integrated motion and eye-tracking tools to study stroke patients and controls performing varied tasks.

Result: Stroke participants had impaired saccade timing and reach accuracy, but restored timing distributions in the task involving segmented cues. This suggests cue-sensitive motor coordination disruption.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that motor coordination impairments in stroke extend beyond movement strength and speed, advocating for rehabilitation approaches that also re-train natural temporal coupling of movements.

Abstract: Background: Coordinated control of eye and hand movements is critical for
nearly all goal-directed actions, underpinning tasks ranging from simple object
manipulation to complex tool use. This coordination relies on temporal coupling
between reach and saccade. Stroke disrupts this process at several levels.
Methods: We conducted a comparative eye-tracking study on patients with history
of stroke vs. control performing various tasks. We used the Kinereach
motion-tracking system with integrated eye-tracking functionality for data
collection. Results: Stroke participants showed a flat distribution of saccade
timing, with no clear peak or alignment to the onset of the reach. In terms of
spatial performance, reach gain, the primary index of functional accuracy,
revealed that stroke participants reaches were significantly hypometric
compared to those of controls. In the segmented look-then-reach condition,
stroke participants demonstrated a restoration of a unimodal saccade timing
distribution, time-locked to the saccade cue. Conclusion: Our findings
highlight a dissociation between motor execution and coordination in stroke,
emphasizing that intact movement components do not guarantee intact motor
integration. By identifying a reversible, cue-sensitive disruption in saccade
timing linked specifically to its coordination within a reaching movement, this
work points toward new opportunities for rehabilitation aimed not only at motor
strength and speed, but at training and re-establishing the natural temporal
structure of action.

*Stevens Johnson,Varun Puram,Johnson Thomas,Acsah Konuparamban,Ashwin Kannan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces a quantum-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire (QI-LIF) model that better predicts neuronal action potential (AP) onset timing compared to traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LIF models have high prediction errors for AP onset timing, particularly under dynamic or strong stimuli. This hampers understanding of neural coding in biological systems.

Method: The authors developed the QI-LIF model which treats AP onset as a probabilistic Gaussian wave packet in time and compared its performance against LIF models using synthetic neuronal data.

Result: The QI-LIF model significantly reduced prediction errors for AP onset timing, especially in high-intensity stimulus conditions, aligning better with biological data.

Conclusion: The QI-LIF model advances accuracy in neuronal modeling and demonstrates the potential of quantum-inspired techniques in brain-inspired computing.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of neuronal action potential (AP) onset timing is crucial
for understanding neural coding of danger signals. Traditional leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) models, while widely used, exhibit high relative error
in predicting AP onset latency, especially under strong or rapidly changing
stimuli. Inspired by recent experimental findings and quantum theory, we
present a quantum-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire (QI-LIF) model that treats
AP onset as a probabilistic event, represented by a Gaussian wave packet in
time. This approach captures the biological variability and uncertainty
inherent in neuronal firing. We systematically compare the relative error of AP
onset predictions between the classical LIF and QI-LIF models using synthetic
data from hippocampal and sensory neurons subjected to varying stimulus
amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the QI-LIF model significantly reduces
prediction error, particularly for high-intensity stimuli, aligning closely
with observed biological responses. This work highlights the potential of
quantum-inspired computational frameworks in advancing the accuracy of neural
modeling and has implications for quantum engineering approaches to
brain-inspired computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and investigate higher arity VC theory, its associated tools, and its role in characterizing higher arity PAC learning.

Method: The authors generalized Haussler's packing lemma and devised a slice-wise hypergraph regularity lemma. They also connected these to PAC learning in product spaces.

*Rina Foygel Barber,Ashwin Pananjady*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in time series forecasting, proposing a novel theoretical understanding under temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding regarding the performance of conformal prediction in dependent time series, especially given violations of exchangeability assumptions.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis to evaluate split conformal prediction's coverage probabilities. A new 'switch coefficient' quantifies the impact of temporal dependence on the method.

Result: The study presents bounds on coverage loss due to temporal dependence, applicable to stationary and β-mixing processes. It introduces general tools for analyzing predictive inference methods for dependent data.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction can provide valid prediction intervals under certain temporal dependencies, and the introduced framework advances theoretical understanding in predictive inference for time series.

Abstract: We consider the problem of uncertainty quantification for prediction in a
time series: if we use past data to forecast the next time point, can we
provide valid prediction intervals around our forecasts? To avoid placing
distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal
prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since
it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data
distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical
performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even
short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability
assumption. Using predictors with "memory" -- i.e., predictors that utilize
past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this
problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal
prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may
have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms
of a new "switch coefficient", measuring the extent to which temporal
dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our
characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of
stationary, $\beta$-mixing processes. Along the way, we introduce tools that
may prove useful in analyzing other predictive inference methods for dependent
data.

*Kulunu Dharmakeerthi,Yousef El-Laham,Henry H. Wong,Vamsi K. Potluru,Changhong He,Taosong He*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new tail-adaptive diffusion model to improve learning for conditional distributions, especially in low probability regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle to model conditional distributions in scenarios where the probability of conditioning variables is small, as there are few or no samples in these regions.

Method: The authors adapt data representation and the forward diffusion scheme, leveraging conditional extreme value theory and a non-linear drift term to effectively model tail events.

Result: The proposed approach significantly outperforms standard diffusion models in capturing extreme tail conditions, as validated on synthetic and real-world financial datasets.

Conclusion: Tail-adaptive enhancements enable diffusion models to better capture extreme conditional distributions, addressing a limitation of prior linear approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks with
widespread applications across machine learning and artificial intelligence
systems. While current research has predominantly focused on linear diffusions,
these approaches can face significant challenges when modeling a conditional
distribution, $P(Y|X=x)$, when $P(X=x)$ is small. In these regions, few
samples, if any, are available for training, thus modeling the corresponding
conditional density may be difficult. Recognizing this, we show it is possible
to adapt the data representation and forward scheme so that the sample
complexity of learning a score-based generative model is small in low
probability regions of the conditioning space. Drawing inspiration from
conditional extreme value theory we characterize this method precisely in the
special case in the tail regions of the conditioning variable, $X$. We show how
diffusion with a data-driven choice of nonlinear drift term is best suited to
model tail events under an appropriate representation of the data. Through
empirical validation on two synthetic datasets and a real-world financial
dataset, we demonstrate that our tail-adaptive approach significantly
outperforms standard diffusion models in accurately capturing response
distributions at the extreme tail conditions.

TL;DR: The paper explores the compositional structure in high-dimensional learning tasks, introduces Hyper-Kernel Ridge Regression (HKRR) blending neural networks and kernel methods, demonstrating adaptability in overcoming the curse of dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the success of deep neural networks in high-dimensional problems and address the lack of theoretical foundation by formalizing the role of compositional structure.

Method: The paper introduces HKRR, combining neural networks with kernel methods, and analyzes its sample complexity and optimization techniques like alternating minimization and gradient methods.

Result: HKRR adaptively learns a multi-index model, overcoming the curse of dimensionality, supported by theoretical and numerical results.

Conclusion: HKRR provides a promising approach blending neural network and kernel methods, demonstrating adaptability and overcoming dimensionality limitations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in high-dimensional problems, outperforming models
such as kernel methods, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However,
the theoretical foundations of this success remain poorly understood. We follow
the idea that the compositional structure of the learning task is the key
factor determining when deep networks outperform other approaches. Taking a
step towards formalizing this idea, we consider a simple compositional model,
namely the multi-index model (MIM). In this context, we introduce and study
hyper-kernel ridge regression (HKRR), an approach blending neural networks and
kernel methods. Our main contribution is a sample complexity result
demonstrating that HKRR can adaptively learn MIM, overcoming the curse of
dimensionality. Further, we exploit the kernel nature of the estimator to
develop ad hoc optimization approaches. Indeed, we contrast alternating
minimization and alternating gradient methods both theoretically and
numerically. These numerical results complement and reinforce our theoretical
findings.

*Robert A. Crowell,Florian Krach,Josef Teichmann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Jump ODEs (NJODEs) as generative models to approximate and sample from Itô processes. It ensures recovering true parameters under standard assumptions and handles irregular data well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a generative modeling approach for Itô processes, addressing challenges like irregularly sampled data, missing values, and adversarial training requirements in other models.

Method: The NJODE framework is utilized to approximate the drift and diffusion coefficients of an Itô process from sample observations. The model is trained as a predictive model without needing to generate samples during training.

Result: The NJODE framework successfully recovers true parameters under regularity assumptions and generates samples with the same law as the underlying process. It works optimally for path-dependent dynamics and irregular data.

Conclusion: NJODEs offer a novel approach for modeling Itô processes, providing advantages over traditional methods such as handling irregular data, avoiding adversarial training, and enabling conditional path generation in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we explore how Neural Jump ODEs (NJODEs) can be used as
generative models for It\^o processes. Given (discrete observations of) samples
of a fixed underlying It\^o process, the NJODE framework can be used to
approximate the drift and diffusion coefficients of the process. Under standard
regularity assumptions on the It\^o processes, we prove that, in the limit, we
recover the true parameters with our approximation. Hence, using these learned
coefficients to sample from the corresponding It\^o process generates, in the
limit, samples with the same law as the true underlying process. Compared to
other generative machine learning models, our approach has the advantage that
it does not need adversarial training and can be trained solely as a predictive
model on the observed samples without the need to generate any samples during
training to empirically approximate the distribution. Moreover, the NJODE
framework naturally deals with irregularly sampled data with missing values as
well as with path-dependent dynamics, allowing to apply this approach in
real-world settings. In particular, in the case of path-dependent coefficients
of the It\^o processes, the NJODE learns their optimal approximation given the
past observations and therefore allows generating new paths conditionally on
discrete, irregular, and incomplete past observations in an optimal way.

TL;DR: The paper introduces new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms leveraging the Alternating Sampling Framework for sampling uniform distributions on convex bodies using rejection sampling and projection or separation oracles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently sample uniform distributions on convex bodies with formal guarantees and practical feasibility inspired this research.

Method: Utilizing the Alternating Sampling Framework, the authors employ rejection sampling and projection or separation oracles to enable efficient implementation of the Restricted Gaussian Oracle (RGO).

Result: Non-asymptotic complexities and unbiased sampling with accuracy measured in R'enyi divergence and chi-squared divergence were established.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates efficient implementation of RGO for uniform sampling on convex bodies, presenting practical methods with quantifiable accuracy.

Abstract: We propose new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to sample a uniform
distribution on a convex body $K$. Our algorithms are based on the Alternating
Sampling Framework/proximal sampler, which uses Gibbs sampling on an augmented
distribution and assumes access to the so-called restricted Gaussian oracle
(RGO). The key contribution of this work is the efficient implementation of RGO
for uniform sampling on $K$ via rejection sampling and access to either a
projection oracle or a separation oracle on $K$. In both oracle cases, we
establish non-asymptotic complexities to obtain unbiased samples where the
accuracy is measured in R\'enyi divergence or $\chi^2$-divergence.

### [334] [Pareto-optimal Non-uniform Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02795)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm achieving Pareto-optimal non-uniform language generation, improving upon earlier models by ensuring trade-offs between generation times across different languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works achieved non-uniform language generation guarantees but suffered from sub-optimal generation times. This paper aims to achieve Pareto-optimality, ensuring balanced trade-offs in generation times across languages.

Method: The authors developed an algorithm with (almost) Pareto-optimal generation times while extending the framework to accommodate noisy and representative generation settings.

Result: The resulting algorithm achieves Pareto-optimal generation times for non-uniform language generation and adapts to practical noisy and representative generation scenarios.

Conclusion: Achieving Pareto-optimality sets a new standard in non-uniform language generation, offering a balanced and adaptable approach for practical applications.

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed an interesting model for
language generation in the limit: Given a countable collection of languages,
and an adversary enumerating the strings of some language $L$ from the
collection, the objective is to generate new strings from the target language,
such that all strings generated beyond some finite time are valid. Li, Raman
and Tewari (2024) and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform
generation guarantees in this model, giving algorithms that generate new valid
strings from $L$ after seeing a number of distinct input strings $t(L)$ that
depends only on $L$ (and the collection), but not the enumeration order.
However, for both these works, the language-wise generation times $t(L)$ of the
algorithm can be strictly sub-optimal.
  In this work, we study Pareto-optimality of non-uniform language generation
in the limit. We propose an algorithm, whose generation times $t^\star(L)$ are
(almost) Pareto-optimal: any other algorithm whose generation time for some
language $L$ is strictly smaller than $t^\star(L)$, must satisfy that its
generation time for some other language $L'$ is strictly worse than
$t^\star(L')$. Pareto-optimality is essentially the best that one can achieve
for non-uniform generation. Our algorithmic framework conveniently adapts to
further give Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation algorithms in the
practically motivated settings of noisy as well as representative generation.

### [335] [Even Faster Kernel Matrix Linear Algebra via Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02540)
*Rikhav Shah,Sandeep Silwal,Haike Xu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper explores using kernel density estimation (KDE) for efficient computations involving kernel matrices, achieving faster algorithms for tasks like matrix-vector products and spectral norm calculation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency and reduce runtime dependencies when working with kernel matrices through KDE queries.

Method: Developed algorithms that leverage KDE to compute matrix operations with low dependence on $n$ and reduced polynomial dependence on error, $\\varepsilon$, while providing theoretical upper and lower bounds.

Result: Improved algorithms outperform existing methods in runtime efficiency for various linear algebraic tasks and lower bounds highlight the conditional quadratic time hardness of related problems.

Conclusion: KDE-based approaches substantially improve algorithmic performance for kernel matrix computations but have limitations demonstrated via lower bounds.

Abstract: This paper studies the use of kernel density estimation (KDE) for linear
algebraic tasks involving the kernel matrix of a collection of $n$ data points
in $\mathbb R^d$. In particular, we improve upon existing algorithms for
computing the following up to $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error: matrix-vector
products, matrix-matrix products, the spectral norm, and sum of all entries.
The runtimes of our algorithms depend on the dimension $d$, the number of
points $n$, and the target error $\varepsilon$. Importantly, the dependence on
$n$ in each case is far lower when accessing the kernel matrix through KDE
queries as opposed to reading individual entries.
  Our improvements over existing best algorithms (particularly those of
Backurs, Indyk, Musco, and Wagner '21) for these tasks reduce the polynomial
dependence on $\varepsilon$, and additionally decreases the dependence on $n$
in the case of computing the sum of all entries of the kernel matrix.
  We complement our upper bounds with several lower bounds for related
problems, which provide (conditional) quadratic time hardness results and
additionally hint at the limits of KDE based approaches for the problems we
study.

*Omer Abid,Gholamreza Rafiee*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning classifier based on DNA methylation that accurately identifies eight medulloblastoma subtypes across both HM450 and EPIC platforms, aiding precision medicine efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for personalized treatment strategies in medulloblastoma due to the heterogeneity of its subtypes, especially within Groups 3 and 4.

Method: The study developed a machine learning classifier that leverages DNA methylation profiling to accurately delineate medulloblastoma subtypes across different assay platforms (HM450 and EPIC).

Result: The classifier achieved excellent metrics, with weighted F1 = 0.95 and balanced accuracy = 0.957, demonstrating high precision and consistency across different platforms.

Conclusion: The cross-platform classifier enhances accessibility to molecular subgroup identification, supports precision medicine initiatives, and has future applications in clinical trials and patient care when deployed via a web application.

Abstract: Medulloblastoma is a malignant pediatric brain cancer, and the discovery of
molecular subgroups is enabling personalized treatment strategies. In 2019, a
consensus identified eight novel subtypes within Groups 3 and 4, each
displaying heterogeneous characteristics. Classifiers are essential for
translating these findings into clinical practice by supporting clinical
trials, personalized therapy development and application, and patient
monitoring. This study presents a DNA methylation-based, cross-platform machine
learning classifier capable of distinguishing these subtypes on both HM450 and
EPIC methylation array samples. Across two independent test sets, the model
achieved weighted F1 = 0.95 and balanced accuracy = 0.957, consistent across
platforms. As the first cross-platform solution, it provides backward
compatibility while extending applicability to a newer platform, also enhancing
accessibility. It also has the potential to become the first publicly available
classifier for these subtypes once deployed through a web application, as
planned in the future. This work overall takes steps in the direction of
advancing precision medicine and improving clinical outcomes for patients
within the majority prevalence medulloblastoma subgroups, groups 3 and 4.

*Taehan Kim,Sangdae Nam*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAE-RNA, an interpretability framework for RNA language models (e.g., RiNALMo) to map their embeddings to known biological features without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand what RNA language models encode about mRNA or ncRNA families, which is currently unclear.

Method: The authors developed SAE-RNA, a framework for concept discovery in pretrained RNA embeddings that interprets RiNALMo representations by linking them to human-level biological insights.

Result: The method enables the probing of ncRNA family representations, facilitates comparisons between RNA groups, and supports hypothesis generation on previously unrecognized RNA relationships.

Conclusion: SAE-RNA establishes a novel way to interpret RNA language models and extends their application in generating new biological insights and comparisons between RNA types.

Abstract: Deep learning, particularly with the advancement of Large Language Models,
has transformed biomolecular modeling, with protein advances (e.g., ESM)
inspiring emerging RNA language models such as RiNALMo. Yet how and what these
RNA Language Models internally encode about messenger RNA (mRNA) or non-coding
RNA (ncRNA) families remains unclear. We present SAE- RNA, interpretability
model that analyzes RiNALMo representations and maps them to known human-level
biological features. Our work frames RNA interpretability as concept discovery
in pretrained embeddings, without end-to-end retraining, and provides practical
tools to probe what RNA LMs may encode about ncRNA families. The model can be
extended to close comparisons between RNA groups, and supporting hypothesis
generation about previously unrecognized relationships.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Flowr.root is a model for 3D ligand generation with affinity prediction, achieving top-notch results in molecule generation, ligand design, and binding affinity prediction, while enabling project-specific adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a model that integrates 3D ligand generation and binding affinity prediction to streamline and improve the process of structure-based drug design.

Method: A flow-matching model, Flowr.root, is introduced, which incorporates training on mixed-fidelity datasets and fine-tuning using curated co-crystal datasets. The model facilitates tasks like de novo generation, conditional sampling, fragment elaboration, and affinity prediction.

Result: Flowr.root shows state-of-the-art performance in molecule generation and ligand design. Its affinity prediction module is faster and more accurate on benchmarks like SPINDR and Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE.

Conclusion: Flowr.root is a versatile tool for drug design, integrating ligand generation, affinity estimation, and property-directed sampling. It performs robustly in both general and project-specific use cases.

Abstract: We present Flowr.root, an equivariant flow-matching model for pocket-aware 3D
ligand generation with joint binding affinity prediction and confidence
estimation. The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional
sampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50,
pKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with
mixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated
co-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific
adaptation. Flowr.root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional
3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing
geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity
prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and
outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with
substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, Flowr.root requires
finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen
structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental
data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling
through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity
compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2alpha ligand generation
against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and
quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ERalpha and TYK2 scaffold
elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating
structure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling,
Flowr.root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design
spanning hit identification through lead optimization.

### [339] [Hyperparameters are all you need: Using five-step inference for an original diffusion model to generate images comparable to the latest distillation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02390)
*Zilai Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a training-free algorithm that generates high-quality 512x512 and 1024x1024 images in just eight steps, with competitive FID scores compared to state-of-the-art models, all validated on COCO and LAION datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and quality of high-resolution image generation using diffusion models without requiring additional training.

Method: Derived from analysis of truncation errors in diffusion ODE and SDE, the algorithm uses a training-free approach to achieve high-quality image generation in significantly fewer steps.

Result: The algorithm produces 512x512 images with better FID scores than state-of-the-art solvers and generates 1024x1024 images in 8 steps, with performance comparable to distillation-based models, achieved without extra training. It also supports effective 5-step generation.

Conclusion: This training-free algorithm sets a benchmark for fast and high-quality image generation, showcasing competitiveness with or superiority over existing methods in various datasets and configurations.

Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an
image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation
process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation
or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation
error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free
algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight
steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our
algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8
steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation
model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also
generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than
the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We
validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO
2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and
17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further,
it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID
performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in
five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID
performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61,
respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED
Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the
state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We
also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps,
whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation
algorithm. The code is in repo:

*O Roustant,N Lüthen,D Heredia,B Sudret*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Poincaré basis for global sensitivity analysis (GSA), leveraging derivatives to improve accuracy and efficiency, demonstrated using a flood modeling case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and accurate computation of Sobol' indices in GSA, especially when derivatives are available and data is limited.

Method: Developing the Poincaré basis, rooted in weighted Poincaré inequalities and Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems, and integrating it into a framework combining sparse gradient-enhanced regression with derivative-based sensitivity analysis.

Result: The introduced method performs well in estimating Sobol' indices with limited data, as demonstrated through a flood modeling case study.

Conclusion: The proposed Poincaré basis and framework enhance the computational efficiency and accuracy of GSA by effectively utilizing derivative information.

Abstract: Chaos expansions are widely used in global sensitivity analysis (GSA), as
they leverage orthogonal bases of L2 spaces to efficiently compute Sobol'
indices, particularly in data-scarce settings. When derivatives are available,
we argue that a desirable property is for the derivatives of the basis
functions to also form an orthogonal basis. We demonstrate that the only basis
satisfying this property is the one associated with weighted Poincar{\'e}
inequalities and Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems, which we refer to as the
Poincar{\'e} basis. We then introduce a comprehensive framework for
gradient-enhanced GSA that integrates recent advances in sparse,
gradient-enhanced regression for surrogate modeling with the construction of
weighting schemes for derivative-based sensitivity analysis. The proposed
methodology is applicable to a broad class of probability measures and supports
various choices of weights. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach on
a challenging flood modeling case study, where Sobol' indices are accurately
estimated using limited data.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical advancements for Generalised Variational Inference (GVI), demonstrating robustness to prior misspecification and establishing convergence rates within a bounded divergence framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in GVI related to robustness under severe prior misspecification, operating under intractable posteriors, and to ensure convergence while restricting the space of GVI posterior measures.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework to analyze GVI with bounded divergences. They derive sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and concentration properties of GVI posteriors in arbitrary Polish spaces, while addressing challenges posed by prior misspecification.

Result: They establish that the GVI posterior measure concentrates on a neighborhood of loss minimizers, achieve convergence rates, and prove robustness irrespective of the prior measure.

Conclusion: The advancements make GVI and Federated GVI more robust and practical under severe prior misspecifications, providing theoretical guarantees for posterior existence, uniqueness, and convergence properties.

Abstract: We prove rates of convergence and robustness to prior misspecification within
a Generalised Variational Inference (GVI) framework with bounded divergences.
This addresses a significant open challenge for GVI and Federated GVI that
employ a different divergence to the Kullback--Leibler under prior
misspecification, operate within a subset of possible probability measures, and
result in intractable posteriors. Our theoretical contributions cover severe
prior misspecification while relying on our ability to restrict the space of
possible GVI posterior measures, and infer properties based on this space. In
particular, we are able to establish sufficient conditions for existence and
uniqueness of GVI posteriors on arbitrary Polish spaces, prove that the GVI
posterior measure concentrates on a neighbourhood of loss minimisers, and
extend this to rates of convergence regardless of the prior measure.

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a non-reversible sampling method for Bayesian finite mixture models, showing improved convergence and performance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo methods struggle with convergence when the number of observations is large or when mixture components overlap significantly.

Method: The authors propose a novel non-reversible sampling scheme and analyze its theoretical properties and practical implications for Bayesian finite mixture models.

Result: The new sampling scheme is theoretically proven to outperform or match classical methods, with reduced asymptotic variance and convergence time scaling from O$(n^2)$ to O$(n)$.

Conclusion: The non-reversible sampler is well-suited for mixture models and demonstrates significant improvements in sampling efficiency over traditional methods.

Abstract: Finite mixtures are a cornerstone of Bayesian modelling, and it is well-known
that sampling from the resulting posterior distribution can be a hard task. In
particular, popular reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes are often slow
to converge when the number of observations $n$ is large. In this paper we
introduce a novel and simple non-reversible sampling scheme for Bayesian finite
mixture models, which is shown to drastically outperform classical samplers in
many scenarios of interest, especially during convergence phase and when
components in the mixture have non-negligible overlap. At the theoretical
level, we show that the performance of the proposed non-reversible scheme
cannot be worse than the standard one, in terms of asymptotic variance, by more
than a factor of four; and we provide a scaling limit analysis suggesting that
the non-reversible sampler can reduce the convergence time from O$(n^2)$ to
O$(n)$. We also discuss why the statistical features of mixture models make
them an ideal case for the use of non-reversible discrete samplers.

*Pascal Helson,Etienne Tanré,Romain Veltz*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The study introduces a McKean-Vlasov mean-field (MKV-MF) approach to analyze spiking neural networks with synaptic plasticity, simplifying complex dynamics and reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address computational and theoretical challenges in analyzing spiking neural networks with synaptic plasticity, which are hindered by factors like $N^2$ complexity and intricate neuron-synapse coupling.

Method: The authors define a typical neuron X and study spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in a probabilistic network model. They derive a simplified representation using a McKean-Vlasov mean-field analysis, reducing complexity.

Result: The MKV-MF representation is mathematically exact, reduces computational demands, and provides dynamic insights into spiking neural networks with plasticity.

Conclusion: This work offers a novel, computationally tractable framework for studying spiking neural networks with synaptic plasticity, facilitating transient dynamics analysis and advancing theoretical understanding.

Abstract: Analysing biological spiking neural network models with synaptic plasticity
has proven to be challenging both theoretically and numerically. In a network
with N all-to-all connected neurons, the number of synaptic connections is on
the order of $N^2$, making these models computationally demanding. Furthermore,
the intricate coupling between neuron and synapse dynamics, along with the
heterogeneity generated by plasticity, hinder the use of classic theoretical
tools such as mean-field or slow-fast analyses. To address these challenges, we
introduce a new variable which we term a typical neuron X. Viewed as a
post-synaptic neuron, X is composed of the activity state V , the time since
its last spike S, and the empirical distribution $\xi$ of the triplet V , S and
W (incoming weight) associated to the pre-synaptic neurons. In particular, we
study a stochastic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) model of connection
in a probabilistic Wilson-Cowan spiking neural network model, which features
binary neural activity. Taking the large N limit, we obtain from the empirical
distribution of the typical neuron a simplified yet accurate representation of
the original spiking network. This mean-field limit is a piecewise
deterministic Markov process (PDMP) of McKean-Vlasov type, where the typical
neuron dynamics depends on its own distribution. We term this analysis
McKean-Vlasov mean-field (MKV-MF). Our approach not only reduces computational
complexity but also provides insights into the dynamics of this spiking neural
network with plasticity. The model obtained is mathematically exact and capable
of tracking transient changes. This analysis marks the first exploration of
MKV-MF dynamics in a network of spiking neurons interacting with STDP.

*Guy Ohayon,Pierre-Etienne H. Fiquet,Florentin Guth,Jona Ballé,Eero P. Simoncelli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel distance function based on denoising error vectors, proving its validity and applicability to complex distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics often struggle to appropriately capture perceptual differences across complex data distributions, motivating the need for a more adaptable solution.

Method: The method builds on a relationship between information and estimation theory, employing optimal denoisers and comparing error vectors across noise levels. It is computationally realized with a learned denoiser and a one-dimensional integral.

Result: For Gaussian distributions, the IEM aligns with Mahalanobis distance, but for complex distributions, it adjusts to their geometry. Experiments with ImageNet show competitive or superior performance compared to existing supervised image quality metrics.

Conclusion: The IEM provides a versatile and computationally feasible tool that adapts to underlying data distributions, proving effective for perceptual quality assessment tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of
distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density
over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship
between information theory and estimation theory, which links the
log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to
noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of
signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of
noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector
fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels.
We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form
expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian
metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the
Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both
locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM
can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion
models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our
framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this
IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image
quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-access UAV-based hyperspectral datasets for landmine and UXO detection, enabling advanced research in this field.

Method: Using a UAV-mounted Headwall Nano-Hyperspec sensor, hyperspectral data was collected, calibrated, orthorectified, and converted to reflectance via a two-point Empirical Line Method (ELM), with validation through spectral error metrics.

Result: The dataset showed high spectral accuracy with RMSE < 1.0 and SAM between 1-6 degrees, making it a reliable resource.

Conclusion: This project delivers a comprehensive, validated benchmark dataset that supports landmine detection research and complements existing drone-based EMI data from the same field.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset of Visible and Near-Infrared

platform for landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection research. The
dataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic
surrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and
fully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall
Nano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an
altitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands
spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and
mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point
Empirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC
spectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE
values below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm
range, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside
raw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support

*Se-Ho Lee,Keunsoo Ko,Seung-Wook Kim*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A new method using "pigment representation" enhances image quality by dynamically transforming RGB colors into a high-dimensional space for better adaptability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the limitation of conventional methods restricted to predefined color spaces, prompting the need for a more dynamic and adaptable approach to image enhancement.

Method: RGB colors are transformed into a high-dimensional feature space (pigments), reprojection and blending are done based on parameters estimated by a visual encoder, then pigments are reverted back into enhanced RGB images.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image enhancement techniques in tasks like image retouching and tone mapping, while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The pigment-based representation offers a significant breakthrough in image enhancement, providing superior results with lower complexity and smaller model size compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient image enhancement method based on
pigment representation. Unlike conventional methods where the color
transformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method
dynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a
high-dimensional feature space referred to as \textit{pigments}. The proposed
pigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving
superior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves
transforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then
reprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of
the colors in pigment spaces. Those pigments are then transformed back into RGB
colors to generate an enhanced output image. The transformation and
reprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively
estimates such parameters based on the content in the input image. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
method over state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks, including
image retouching and tone mapping, while maintaining relatively low
computational complexity and small model size.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GCVAMD, a novel model using a modified CausalVAE to extract latent causal factors from OCT images for AMD detection and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on pathologies and causal mechanisms in existing AI-based AMD detection systems, which limit their effectiveness for intervention analysis and reliability.

Method: A modified CausalVAE approach is used to create the GCVAMD model for extracting latent causal factors from raw OCT images, allowing for causal inference and treatment simulations.

Result: The GCVAMD model successfully identifies drusen and neovascularization statuses while providing latent causal features that enhance AMD detection and enable intervention analysis.

Conclusion: GCVAMD enables a deeper understanding of AMD's causal mechanisms and improves early diagnosis and treatment analysis, offering potential for more effective medical applications.

Abstract: Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes
of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as
anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the
degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision
loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD
or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to
reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches,
deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and
GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in
distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI
driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists
regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works
mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying
causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific
factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a
novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified
CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT
images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal
inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major
risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent
causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through
GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD
causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for
various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.

this work, we propose Wave-GMS, a lightweight and efficient multi-scale
generative model for medical image segmentation. Wave-GMS has a substantially
smaller number of trainable parameters, does not require loading
memory-intensive pretrained vision foundation models, and supports training
with large batch sizes on GPUs with limited memory. We conducted extensive
experiments on four publicly available datasets (BUS, BUSI, Kvasir-Instrument,
and HAM10000), demonstrating that Wave-GMS achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance with superior cross-domain generalizability, while
requiring only ~2.6M trainable parameters. Code is available at

### [349] [oRANS: Online optimisation of RANS machine learning models with embedded DNS data generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02982)
*Daniel Dehtyriov,Jonathan F. MacArt,Justin Sirignano*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper presents an online optimization framework for deep learning-based turbulence models to overcome limitations related to scarce high-fidelity datasets. The method dynamically integrates direct numerical simulations (DNS) into Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations, enabling adaptive training during simulation and improving generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional offline-trained turbulence closure models overfit and fail to generalize to new flow regimes due to reliance on scarce and costly precomputed high-fidelity training datasets.

Method: The proposed framework dynamically embeds a direct numerical simulation (DNS) subdomain within a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulation. The RANS domain supplies boundary conditions to the DNS, which in turn returns turbulence statistics for iterative updates of the deep learning-based closure model during the simulation.

Result: The method improves out-of-distribution generalization and outperforms both conventional offline-trained and existing calibrated turbulence closure models across various flow conditions, requiring only modest DNS subdomains. Performance deteriorates when boundary conditions become corrupted or subdomain lengths fail to capture essential low-wavenumber modes.

Conclusion: This framework represents a scalable approach for developing physics-informed machine learning closures, enabling adaptability to different flow regimes without relying on extensive precomputed datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for accelerating and enhancing
the accuracy of flow physics simulations, but progress is constrained by the
scarcity of high-fidelity training data, which is costly to generate and
inherently limited to a small set of flow conditions. Consequently, closures
trained in the conventional offline paradigm tend to overfit and fail to
generalise to new regimes. We introduce an online optimisation framework for
DL-based Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) closures which seeks to
address the challenge of limited high-fidelity datasets. Training data is
dynamically generated by embedding a direct numerical simulation (DNS) within a
subdomain of the RANS domain. The RANS solution supplies boundary conditions to
the DNS, while the DNS provides mean velocity and turbulence statistics that
are used to update a DL closure model during the simulation. This feedback loop
enables the closure to adapt to the embedded DNS target flow, avoiding reliance
on precomputed datasets and improving out-of-distribution performance. The
approach is demonstrated for the stochastically forced Burgers equation and for
turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=180$, $270$, $395$ and $590$ with varying
embedded domain lengths $1\leq L_0/L\leq 8$. Online-optimised RANS models
significantly outperform both offline-trained and literature-calibrated
closures, with accurate training achieved using modest DNS subdomains.
Performance degrades primarily when boundary-condition contamination dominates
or when domains are too short to capture low-wavenumber modes. This framework
provides a scalable route to physics-informed machine learning closures,
enabling data-adaptive reduced-order models that generalise across flow regimes
without requiring large precomputed training datasets.

*Jannik Graebner,Ryne Beeson*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based framework for refining optimal spacecraft trajectory solutions, leveraging conditional diffusion models and self-supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of generating good initial guesses for spacecraft trajectory optimization and completing Pareto fronts efficiently, especially in multibody environments.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion models to represent candidate trajectory distributions and incorporates an MCMC algorithm with self-supervised fine-tuning to propose new data and optimize solutions.

Result: The method successfully completed a partial Pareto front for a Jupiter-Europa transfer problem and generated a superior Pareto front for a Saturn-Titan transfer, avoiding the need for a separate data generation phase.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the quality of trajectory solutions in a flexible and efficient manner, highlighting its potential for broader applications in spacecraft trajectory optimization.

Abstract: Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft
trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution
space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate
variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that
reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible
manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related
trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion
models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions.
We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the
aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is
employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model
using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint
violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for
separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical
experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve
sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of
Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa
circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a
partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior
Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method
for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a
separate dedicated global search.

### [351] [The Equilibrium Response of Atmospheric Machine-Learning Models to Uniform Sea Surface Temperature Warming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02415)
*Bosong Zhang,Timothy M. Merlis*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well state-of-the-art machine learning models simulate climate responses beyond their training distributions using sea surface temperature warming as a benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the open question of whether ML models can reliably generalize to climate scenarios outside their training parameters, given their growing use in climate simulations.

Method: Key climate diagnostics such as temperature, precipitation, wind profiles, and radiation are compared between ML models (ACE2-ERA5, NeuralGCM, cBottle) and a physics-based model (GFDL's AM4).

Result: ML models can reproduce some important physical climate responses, like precipitation changes, but they show significant deviations in radiative dynamics and land warming.

Conclusion: Although ML models show promise for climate simulations, they currently lack robust generalization capabilities, calling for further model refinement.

Abstract: Machine learning models for the global atmosphere that are capable of
producing stable, multi-year simulations of Earth's climate have recently been
developed. However, the ability of these ML models to generalize beyond the
training distribution remains an open question. In this study, we evaluate the
climate response of several state-of-the-art ML models (ACE2-ERA5, NeuralGCM,
and cBottle) to a uniform sea surface temperature warming, a widely used
benchmark for evaluating climate change. We assess each ML model's performance
relative to a physics-based general circulation model (GFDL's AM4) across key
diagnostics, including surface air temperature, precipitation, temperature and
wind profiles, and top-of-the-atmosphere radiation. While the ML models
reproduce key aspects of the physical model response, particularly the response
of precipitation, some exhibit notable departures from robust physical
responses, including radiative responses and land region warming. Our results
highlight the promise and current limitations of ML models for climate change
applications and suggest that further improvements are needed for robust
out-of-sample generalization.

### [352] [Hybrid Schemes of NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standard Algorithms and Quantum Key Distribution for Key Exchange and Digital Signature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02379)
*Abel C. H. Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes hybrid cryptographic schemes combining quantum key distribution (QKD) with NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms to enhance security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the complementary strengths of QKD (based on quantum mechanics) and PQC (based on mathematical hardness) by creating dual-layered security schemes that offer robust protection against quantum threats.

Method: The authors design two hybrid schemes: (1) a QKD-PQC hybrid key exchange protocol combining Module-Lattice-based KEMs with BB84 and E91 protocols, and (2) a QKD-PQC hybrid digital signature scheme using Module-Lattice-based DSAs and Stateless Hash-based DSAs verified via QKD. They evaluate these schemes for shared key properties (entropy, IID), computation time, and communication overhead.

Result: The hybrid key exchange protocol is capable of producing secure shared keys with high entropy and IID properties. The evaluation also includes computation time and message length metrics, ensuring the protocols are practical for implementation.

Conclusion: By integrating QKD with NIST-standardized PQC, the study highlights the feasibility and benefits of hybrid cryptographic schemes, offering stronger security against quantum-enabled threats.

Abstract: Since the security of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms is based on
the hardness of mathematical problems, while the security of quantum key
distribution (QKD) relies on the fundamental principles of quantum physics,
each approach possesses distinct advantages and limitations that can complement
one another. Consequently, recent studies have proposed hybrid schemes that
combine QKD and PQC to establish a dual-layered security model. In response to
this trend, this study proposes hybrid schemes that integrate QKD with the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized PQC
algorithms. These hybrid schemes include two core components: a hybrid QKD-PQC
key exchange protocol and a hybrid QKD-PQC digital signature scheme. For the
hybrid key exchange protocol, this study combines Module-Lattice-based Key
Encapsulation Mechanisms (ML-KEM) with QKD protocols, specifically BB84 and
E91, to construct a secure key exchange protocol. In the design of the hybrid
digital signature scheme, this study utilizes Module-Lattice-based Digital
Signature Algorithms (ML-DSA) and Stateless Hash-based Digital Signature
Algorithms (SLH-DSA) to generate signature reconstruction values. These values
are verified using confirmation codes transmitted via the BB84 and E91
protocols. The proposed hybrid key exchange protocol is evaluated by examining
the shared secret key it produces, particularly with respect to entropy and
whether the output is independent and identically distributed (IID).
Furthermore, the computation time and message lengths of the proposed hybrid
schemes are evaluated.

### [353] [Rigorous Evaluation of Microarchitectural Side-Channels with Statistical Model Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02475)
*Weihang Li,Pete Crowley,Arya Tschand,Yu Wang,Miroslav Pajic,Daniel Sorin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Statistical Model Checking (SMC) for rigorously evaluating microarchitectural side channels, addressing challenges posed by the probabilistic behaviors and complexity of processors without requiring assumptions or simplifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating microarchitectural side channels is challenging due to natural noise, probabilistic attacks and defenses, and the complexity of real processors, which previous simplified models fail to accurately capture for security concerns.

Method: The paper employs Statistical Model Checking (SMC), a statistically sound technique that does not require simplifying assumptions, to analyze processors as opaque systems and evaluate their vulnerabilities and defenses.

Result: Through three case studies, SMC demonstrated its ability to rigorously assess security issues and provide actionable insights into noise injection for mitigating attacks, achieving results consistent with less rigorous previous methods.

Conclusion: SMC provides a statistically rigorous, assumption-free method to evaluate microarchitectural side channels, paving the way for more precise and actionable security assessments in complex processor scenarios.

Abstract: Rigorous quantitative evaluation of microarchitectural side channels is
challenging for two reasons. First, the processors, attacks, and defenses often
exhibit probabilistic behaviors. These probabilistic behaviors arise due to
natural noise in systems (e.g., from co-running processes), probabilistic side
channel attacks, and probabilistic obfuscation defenses. Second,
microprocessors are extremely complex. Previous evaluation methods have relied
on abstract or simplified models, which are necessarily less detailed than real
systems or cycle-by-cycle simulators, and these models may miss important
phenomena. Whereas a simple model may suffice for estimating performance,
security issues frequently manifest in the details.
  We address this challenge by introducing Statistical Model Checking (SMC) to
the quantitative evaluation of microarchitectural side channels. SMC is a
rigorous statistical technique that can process the results of probabilistic
experiments and provide statistical guarantees, and it has been used in
computing applications that depend heavily on statistical guarantees (e.g.,
medical implants, vehicular computing). With SMC, we can treat processors as
opaque boxes, and we do not have to abstract or simplify them. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of SMC through three case studies, in which we experimentally
show that SMC can evaluate existing security vulnerabilities and defenses and
provide qualitatively similar conclusions with greater statistical rigor, while
making no simplifying assumptions or abstractions. We also show that SMC can
enable a defender to quantify the amount of noise necessary to have a desired
level of confidence that she has reduced an attacker's probability of success
to less than a desired threshold, thus providing the defender with an
actionable plan for obfuscation via noise injection.

### [354] [Federated Spatiotemporal Graph Learning for Passive Attack Detection in Smart Grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02371)
*Bochra Al Agha,Razane Tajeddine*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study introduces an innovative detector for detecting stealthy passive attacks in smart grids by combining spatial and temporal context using a graph-centric approach and federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart grids are vulnerable to passive eavesdropping attacks, which can expose sensitive information like consumption patterns and grid topology. There's a need for effective detection methods for these silent threats, as traditional approaches struggle to identify faint and transient signals.

Method: The researchers propose a graph-centric, multimodal system leveraging graph convolution and bidirectional GRU layers to fuse spatial and temporal indicators. Their method operates within a federated learning framework using FedProx to enhance decentralized training.

Result: The proposed model achieves impressive detection capabilities, with testing accuracy reaching 98.32% per-timestep and 93.35% per-sequence. It maintains a low false-positive rate of 0.15%, demonstrating robustness in heterogeneous smart-grid communication scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach effectively detects stealthy reconnaissance attacks in smart grids while ensuring robustness, decentralized data privacy, and low false positives, making it well-suited for real-world deployments in non-IID distributed environments.

Abstract: Smart grids are exposed to passive eavesdropping, where attackers listen
silently to communication links. Although no data is actively altered, such
reconnaissance can reveal grid topology, consumption patterns, and operational
behavior, creating a gateway to more severe targeted attacks. Detecting this
threat is difficult because the signals it produces are faint, short-lived, and
often disappear when traffic is examined by a single node or along a single
timeline. This paper introduces a graph-centric, multimodal detector that fuses
physical-layer and behavioral indicators over ego-centric star subgraphs and
short temporal windows to detect passive attacks. To capture stealthy
perturbations, a two-stage encoder is introduced: graph convolution aggregates
spatial context across ego-centric star subgraphs, while a bidirectional GRU
models short-term temporal dependencies. The encoder transforms heterogeneous
features into a unified spatio-temporal representation suitable for
classification. Training occurs in a federated learning setup under FedProx,
improving robustness to heterogeneous local raw data and contributing to the
trustworthiness of decentralized training; raw measurements remain on client
devices. A synthetic, standards-informed dataset is generated to emulate
heterogeneous HAN/NAN/WAN communications with wireless-only passive
perturbations, event co-occurrence, and leak-safe splits. The model achieves a
testing accuracy of 98.32% per-timestep (F1_{attack}=0.972) and 93.35%
per-sequence at 0.15% FPR using a simple decision rule with run-length m=2 and
threshold $\tau=0.55$. The results demonstrate that combining spatial and
temporal context enables reliable detection of stealthy reconnaissance while
maintaining low false-positive rates, making the approach suitable for non-IID
federated smart-grid deployments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolyLink, a blockchain-based decentralized AI platform aimed at addressing issues like centralization, trust, and cost in LLM services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized deployment of LLMs creates trust issues and high costs for users and developers, motivating a shift towards decentralization.

Method: PolyLink employs a blockchain-based decentralized crowdsourcing approach, supports deployment across heterogeneous edge devices, utilizes the TIQE protocol for inference integrity, and includes token-based incentives for participants.

Result: Real-world evaluation shows PolyLink's deployment across geo-distributed heterogeneous devices delivers practical latency, security against model degradation attacks, and validator corruption.

Conclusion: PolyLink provides a decentralized, secure, and cost-effective solution to LLM deployment while ensuring reliable inference integrity and incentivizing participant engagement.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has
revolutionized the AI landscape. However, the deployment model and usage of LLM
services remain highly centralized, creating significant trust issues and costs
for end users and developers. To address these issues, we propose PolyLink, a
blockchain-based decentralized AI platform that decentralizes LLM development
and inference. Specifically, PolyLink introduces a decentralized crowdsourcing
architecture that supports single-device and cross-device model deployment and
inference across heterogeneous devices at the edge. Moreover, to ensure the
inference integrity, we design the TIQE protocol, which combines a lightweight
cross-encoder model and an LLM-as-a-Judge for a high-accuracy inference
evaluation. Lastly, we integrate a comprehensive token-based incentive model
with dynamic pricing and reward mechanisms for all participants. We have
deployed PolyLink and conducted an extensive real-world evaluation through
geo-distributed deployment across heterogeneous devices. Results indicate that
the inference and verification latency is practical. Our security analysis
demonstrates that the system is resistant to model degradation attacks and
validator corruptions. PolyLink is now available at

*Lekkala Sai Teja,Annepaka Yadagiri,Sangam Sai Anish,Siva Gopala Krishna Nuthakki,Partha Pakray*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel detection framework (PIFE) for AI-generated text, which significantly improves resilience against adversarial attacks like paraphrasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of advanced LLMs creates a dual-use problem, necessitating dependable text detection systems that can withstand adversarial attacks, especially paraphrasing.

Method: The proposed method, Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering (PIFE), standardizes text using a normalization pipeline and quantifies transformations with metrics like Levenshtein distance and semantic similarity for better classification.

Result: Conventional training performs poorly (48.8% TPR at 1% FPR) under semantic attacks, but the PIFE model achieves a 82.6% TPR, demonstrating significant robustness.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of perturbation artifacts enhances adversarial robustness, making the PIFE framework a promising solution in combating sophisticated semantic attacks.

Abstract: The growth of highly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) constitutes a huge
dual-use problem, making it necessary to create dependable AI-generated text
detection systems. Modern detectors are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, with paraphrasing standing out as an effective evasion technique that
foils statistical detection. This paper presents a comparative study of
adversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard
adversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more
resilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering
(PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text
into a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then
quantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein
distance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the
classifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our
PIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and
sentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional
adversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against
semantic attacks, an effect we term "semantic evasion threshold", where its
True Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In
stark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the
discrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation.
It maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively
neutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance
demonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than
merely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine
robustness in the adversarial arms race.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentic-AI Healthcare, a privacy-aware, multilingual,

integrates a dedicated Privacy and Compliance Layer that applies role-based
access control (RBAC), AES-GCM field-level encryption, and tamper-evident audit
logging, aligning with major healthcare data protection standards such as HIPAA

multilingual patient-doctor interaction (English, French, Arabic) and
transparent diagnostic reasoning powered by large language models. As an

agentic orchestration, multilingual accessibility, and compliance-aware
architecture in healthcare applications. This platform is presented as a

### [358] [CATMark: A Context-Aware Thresholding Framework for Robust Cross-Task Watermarking in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02342)
*Yu Zhang,Shuliang Liu,Xu Yang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a watermarking method for Large Language Models (LLMs) named Context-Aware Threshold watermarking (CAT), improving text quality and detection efficiency without predefined thresholds or task tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods degrade text quality in low-entropy scenarios and require computationally demanding entropy thresholds with limited adaptability to unknown tasks.

Method: The proposed CAT algorithm dynamically adjusts watermarking intensity using real-time semantic context by partitioning text generation into semantic states via logits clustering.

Result: CAT improved text quality in cross-task scenarios without compromising watermark detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The method is an efficient, context-aware approach for watermarking LLM outputs, balancing text quality and robust watermark embedding with adaptability.

Abstract: Watermarking algorithms for Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively identify
machine-generated content by embedding and detecting hidden statistical
features in text. However, such embedding leads to a decline in text quality,
especially in low-entropy scenarios where performance needs improvement.
Existing methods that rely on entropy thresholds often require significant
computational resources for tuning and demonstrate poor adaptability to unknown
or cross-task generation scenarios. We propose \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{T}hreshold watermarking ($\myalgo$), a novel framework that dynamically
adjusts watermarking intensity based on real-time semantic context. $\myalgo$
partitions text generation into semantic states using logits clustering,
establishing context-aware entropy thresholds that preserve fidelity in
structured content while embedding robust watermarks. Crucially, it requires no
pre-defined thresholds or task-specific tuning. Experiments show $\myalgo$
improves text quality in cross-tasks without sacrificing detection accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates five non-contrastive self-supervised learning methods with three encoder architectures and six augmentation strategies for network intrusion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised learning methods are limited to detecting known anomalies, prompting exploration of self-supervised learning for broader detection capabilities.

Method: Conducts ninety systematic experiments comparing non-contrastive methods across different encoder architectures and augmentation strategies on two datasets, UNSW-NB15 and 5G-NIDD.

Result: Reports the optimal combinations of encoder and augmentation strategies for precision, recall, F1-score, and AUCROC, and demonstrates competitiveness against two unsupervised baselines.

Conclusion: Non-contrastive self-supervised methods show promise for effective network intrusion detection, expanding the arsenal of cybersecurity defenses.

Abstract: Network intrusion detection, a well-explored cybersecurity field, has
predominantly relied on supervised learning algorithms in the past two decades.
However, their limitations in detecting only known anomalies prompt the
exploration of alternative approaches. Motivated by the success of
self-supervised learning in computer vision, there is a rising interest in
adapting this paradigm for network intrusion detection. While prior research
mainly delved into contrastive self-supervised methods, the efficacy of
non-contrastive methods, in conjunction with encoder architectures serving as
the representation learning backbone and augmentation strategies that determine
what is learned, remains unclear for effective attack detection. This paper
compares the performance of five non-contrastive self-supervised learning
methods using three encoder architectures and six augmentation strategies.
Ninety experiments are systematically conducted on two network intrusion
detection datasets, UNSW-NB15 and 5G-NIDD. For each self-supervised model, the
combination of encoder architecture and augmentation method yielding the
highest average precision, recall, F1-score, and AUCROC is reported.
Furthermore, by comparing the best-performing models to two unsupervised
baselines, DeepSVDD, and an Autoencoder, we showcase the competitiveness of the
non-contrastive methods for attack detection. Code at:

*Xinjie Shen,Mufei Li,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EAPrivacy is a benchmark for evaluating privacy awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) agents deployed in physical environments, highlighting deficits like prioritizing task completion over privacy in 86% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation methods for physical-world privacy awareness in LLM-powered agents.

Method: EAPrivacy uses procedurally generated scenarios across four tiers to assess privacy handling, environment adaptation, privacy-task balance, and societal norm conflicts.

Result: Top-performing models like Gemini 2.5 Pro showed only 59% accuracy in changing physical environments, and up to 86% prioritized tasks over privacy constraints.

Conclusion: Findings demonstrate misalignments in LLMs' physical privacy awareness and advocate for more robust alignment mechanisms.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embodied agents creates an
urgent need to measure their privacy awareness in the physical world. Existing
evaluation methods, however, are confined to natural language based scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we introduce EAPrivacy, a comprehensive evaluation
benchmark designed to quantify the physical-world privacy awareness of
LLM-powered agents. EAPrivacy utilizes procedurally generated scenarios across
four tiers to test an agent's ability to handle sensitive objects, adapt to
changing environments, balance task execution with privacy constraints, and
resolve conflicts with social norms. Our measurements reveal a critical deficit
in current models. The top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieved only 59\%
accuracy in scenarios involving changing physical environments. Furthermore,
when a task was accompanied by a privacy request, models prioritized completion
over the constraint in up to 86\% of cases. In high-stakes situations pitting
privacy against critical social norms, leading models like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-haiku disregarded the social norm over 15\% of the time. These
findings, demonstrated by our benchmark, underscore a fundamental misalignment
in LLMs regarding physically grounded privacy and establish the need for more
robust, physically-aware alignment.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacies of traditional privacy frameworks in handling AI systems' unique characteristics like autonomous learning and black-box decision-making.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic review of 45 studies to synthesize and categorize AI privacy risks, resulting in a taxonomy of 19 risks divided into four categories.

Result: The taxonomy identifies a balanced distribution of risks across the four categories, with human error accounting for 9.45% of identified risks.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need to integrate technical and human factors for a holistic approach to AI privacy and contributes to advancing trustworthy AI development and research.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems introduce unprecedented privacy
challenges as they process increasingly sensitive data. Traditional privacy
frameworks prove inadequate for AI technologies due to unique characteristics
such as autonomous learning and black-box decision-making. This paper presents
a taxonomy classifying AI privacy risks, synthesised from 45 studies identified
through systematic review. We identify 19 key risks grouped under four
categories: Dataset-Level, Model-Level, Infrastructure-Level, and Insider
Threat Risks. Findings reveal a balanced distribution across these dimensions,
with human error (9.45%) emerging as the most significant factor. This taxonomy
challenges conventional security approaches that typically prioritise technical
controls over human factors, highlighting gaps in holistic understanding. By
bridging technical and behavioural dimensions of AI privacy, this paper
contributes to advancing trustworthy AI development and provides a foundation

### [363] [A Statistical Method for Attack-Agnostic Adversarial Attack Detection with Compressive Sensing Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02707)
*Chinthana Wimalasuriya,Spyros Tragoudas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a statistical approach to detect adversarial attacks with near-perfect accuracy and reduced false positives by comparing compressed and uncompressed neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks pose a severe threat to machine learning systems, and existing detection methods fail to reliably detect unseen or diverse attack types.

Method: The proposed method establishes a detection baseline before deployment using statistical metrics derived from comparing the behavior of compressed and uncompressed neural networks.

Result: The approach achieves near-perfect detection accuracy across various attack types and demonstrates a significant reduction in false positives.

Conclusion: The method is highly reliable, practical for real-world applications, and outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial detection techniques.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a significant threat to modern machine learning
systems. Yet, existing detection methods often lack the ability to detect
unseen attacks or detect different attack types with a high level of accuracy.
In this work, we propose a statistical approach that establishes a detection
baseline before a neural network's deployment, enabling effective real-time
adversarial detection. We generate a metric of adversarial presence by
comparing the behavior of a compressed/uncompressed neural network pair. Our
method has been tested against state-of-the-art techniques, and it achieves
near-perfect detection across a wide range of attack types. Moreover, it
significantly reduces false positives, making it both reliable and practical
for real-world applications.

### [364] [A-MemGuard: A Proactive Defense Framework for LLM-Based Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02373)
*Qianshan Wei,Tengchao Yang,Yaochen Wang,Xinfeng Li,Lijun Li,Zhenfei Yin,Yi Zhan,Thorsten Holz,Zhiqiang Lin,XiaoFeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces A-MemGuard, a framework to guard against memory-based adversarial attacks in Large Language Model (LLM) agents, achieving over 95% reduction in attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents rely heavily on memory for autonomous tasks, which makes them susceptible to adversarial manipulation of memory. The impact worsens due to undetectable malicious records and self-reinforcing error cycles.

Method: The proposed A-MemGuard integrates (1) consensus-based validation to identify anomalies and (2) a dual-memory structure to store learned lessons separately and prevent error cycles.

Result: A-MemGuard reduces attack success rates by over 95% with minimal utility trade-off, as confirmed by comprehensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work marks a shift toward proactive defenses in LLM memory security, emphasizing experience-driven models that improve over time. The code is openly available for the community.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents use memory to learn from past interactions,
enabling autonomous planning and decision-making in complex environments.
However, this reliance on memory introduces a critical security risk: an
adversary can inject seemingly harmless records into an agent's memory to
manipulate its future behavior. This vulnerability is characterized by two core
aspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated
within a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory
entries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can
initiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as
precedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively
lowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these
challenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive
defense framework for LLM agent memory. The core idea of our work is the
insight that memory itself must become both self-checking and self-correcting.
Without modifying the agent's core architecture, A-MemGuard combines two
mechanisms: (1) consensus-based validation, which detects anomalies by
comparing reasoning paths derived from multiple related memories and (2) a
dual-memory structure, where detected failures are distilled into ``lessons''
stored separately and consulted before future actions, breaking error cycles
and enabling adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show
that A-MemGuard effectively cuts attack success rates by over 95% while
incurring a minimal utility cost. This work shifts LLM memory security from
static filtering to a proactive, experience-driven model where defenses
strengthen over time. Our code is available in

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid CAPTCHA system that combines cognitive challenges with behavioral biometrics to enhance security against AI bots while maintaining usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHA systems face limitations, particularly the trade-off between usability for humans and robustness against advanced bots.

Method: The hybrid CAPTCHA system integrates dynamic cognitive questions using LLMs and keystroke dynamics analysis to identify human and bot users.

Result: The proposed system achieves high bot detection accuracy, effectively countering paste and script-based attacks, and receiving positive usability evaluations from human participants.

Conclusion: Combining cognitive and behavioral tests creates a new paradigm for CAPTCHA systems that enhances both security and user experience.

Abstract: Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart
(CAPTCHAs) are a foundational component of web security, yet traditional
implementations suffer from a trade-off between usability and resilience
against AI-powered bots. This paper introduces a novel hybrid CAPTCHA system
that synergizes the cognitive challenges posed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
with the behavioral biometric analysis of keystroke dynamics. Our approach
generates dynamic, unpredictable questions that are trivial for humans but
non-trivial for automated agents, while simultaneously analyzing the user's
typing rhythm to distinguish human patterns from robotic input. We present the
system's architecture, formalize the feature extraction methodology for
keystroke analysis, and report on an experimental evaluation. The results
indicate that our dual-layered approach achieves a high degree of accuracy in
bot detection, successfully thwarting both paste-based and script-based
simulation attacks, while maintaining a high usability score among human
participants. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cognitive and
behavioral tests to create a new generation of more secure and user-friendly
CAPTCHAs.

### [367] [On The Fragility of Benchmark Contamination Detection in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02386)
*Han Wang,Haoyu Li,Brian Ko,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Contamination of benchmarks during training inflates model performance rankings. It’s alarmingly easy to evade detection methods, threatening leaderboard integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of inflated model rankings caused by benchmark contamination, which harms fairness and evaluation credibility.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments were conducted on scenarios of benchmark contamination, exploring vulnerabilities during specific fine-tuning and reinforcement learning processes.

Result: Benchmark contamination signals can be concealed during reinforcement learning, and detection methods perform poorly in the final-stage contamination scenarios.

Conclusion: Existing evaluation methods for LRMs are vulnerable to tampering that undermines fairness and integrity. Advanced protocols and detection techniques are urgently needed.

Abstract: Leaderboards for LRMs have turned evaluation into a competition,
incentivizing developers to optimize directly on benchmark suites. A shortcut
to achieving higher rankings is to incorporate evaluation benchmarks into the
training data, thereby yielding inflated performance, known as benchmark
contamination. Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination
detections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where
contamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM
via SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally
identified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training
can markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.
Further empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style
importance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this
detection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may
inherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination
with CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination
detection methods perform near random guesses. Without exposure to non-members,
contaminated LRMs would still have more confidence when responding to those
unseen samples that share similar distributions to the training set, and thus,
evade existing memorization-based detection methods. Together, our findings
reveal the unique vulnerability of LRMs evaluations: Model developers could
easily contaminate LRMs to achieve inflated leaderboards performance while
leaving minimal traces of contamination, thereby strongly undermining the
fairness of evaluation and threatening the integrity of public leaderboards.
This underscores the urgent need for advanced contamination detection methods
and trustworthy evaluation protocols tailored to LRMs.

### [368] [Dynamic Target Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02422)
*Kedong Xiu,Churui Zeng,Tianhang Zheng,Xinzhe Huang,Xiaojun Jia,Di Wang,Puning Zhao,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Dynamic Target Attack (DTA) leverages a dynamic approach to optimize adversarial prompts by using harmful responses from the model itself as temporary targets, achieving higher attack success rates efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks struggle with inducing fixed affirmative responses due to the low-density region of target outputs in a safety-aligned LLM's distribution.

Method: The proposed DTA framework iteratively samples harmful candidate responses directly from the model's output distribution, optimizing adversarial prompts towards selected responses in each round to reduce the target-output discrepancy.

Result: DTA achieved over 87% attack success rates in white-box settings and 85% in black-box settings, outperforming existing methods by 15-25% while being significantly more time-efficient.

Conclusion: DTA substantially improves the effectiveness and efficiency of jailbreak attacks on safety-aligned LLMs, reducing optimization iterations and leveraging dynamic sampling for better outcomes.

Abstract: Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks typically optimize an adversarial
suffix to induce a fixed affirmative response. However, this fixed target
usually resides in an extremely low-density region of a safety-aligned LLM's
output distribution conditioned on diverse harmful inputs. Due to the
substantial discrepancy between the target and the original output, existing
attacks require numerous iterations to optimize the adversarial prompt, which
might still fail to induce the low-probability target response from the target
LLM. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Target Attack (DTA), a new jailbreaking
framework relying on the target LLM's own responses as targets to optimize the
adversarial prompts. In each optimization round, DTA iteratively samples
multiple candidate responses directly from the output distribution conditioned
on the current prompt, and selects the most harmful response as a temporary
target for prompt optimization. In contrast to existing attacks, DTA
significantly reduces the discrepancy between the target and the output
distribution, substantially easing the optimization process to search for an
effective adversarial prompt.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency
of DTA: under the white-box setting, DTA only needs 200 optimization iterations
to achieve an average attack success rate (ASR) of over 87\% on recent
safety-aligned LLMs, exceeding the state-of-the-art baselines by over 15\%. The
time cost of DTA is 2-26 times less than existing baselines. Under the
black-box setting, DTA uses Llama-3-8B-Instruct as a surrogate model for target
sampling and achieves an ASR of 85\% against the black-box target model
Llama-3-70B-Instruct, exceeding its counterparts by over 25\%.

### [369] [ToolTweak: An Attack on Tool Selection in LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02554)
*Jonathan Sneh,Ruomei Yan,Jialin Yu,Philip Torr,Yarin Gal,Sunando Sengupta,Eric Sommerlade,Alasdair Paren,Adel Bibi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents "ToolTweak," an attack on LLM tool selection by manipulating names/descriptions to unfairly skew choices, demonstrates its effectiveness, and evaluates defense methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore vulnerabilities in LLM-driven tool ecosystems and highlight potential fairness, competition, and security threats caused by biased tool selection.

Method: The authors develop "ToolTweak," an automated attack strategy that modifies tool names and descriptions to influence LLMs' selection behavior.

Result: ToolTweak increased tool selection rates from ~20% to 81%. The attack shows strong cross-model transferability and shifts tool usage distributions.

Conclusion: Emerging tool marketplaces are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, and defenses like paraphrasing and perplexity filtering can alleviate bias, improving fairness and security.

Abstract: As LLMs increasingly power agents that interact with external tools, tool use
has become an essential mechanism for extending their capabilities. These
agents typically select tools from growing databases or marketplaces to solve
user tasks, creating implicit competition among tool providers and developers
for visibility and usage. In this paper, we show that this selection process
harbors a critical vulnerability: by iteratively manipulating tool names and
descriptions, adversaries can systematically bias agents toward selecting
specific tools, gaining unfair advantage over equally capable alternatives. We
present ToolTweak, a lightweight automatic attack that increases selection
rates from a baseline of around 20% to as high as 81%, with strong
transferability between open-source and closed-source models. Beyond individual
tools, we show that such attacks cause distributional shifts in tool usage,
revealing risks to fairness, competition, and security in emerging tool
ecosystems. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate two defenses: paraphrasing and
perplexity filtering, which reduce bias and lead agents to select functionally
similar tools more equally. All code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

*Nik Rollinson,Nikolaos Polatidis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study explores the use of fine-tuned GPT-4.1-mini to generate synthetic Android malware data for detection tasks and evaluates its effectiveness alongside real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in Android malware detection due to data scarcity and limitations of signature-based and machine learning defense mechanisms, exploring synthetic data generation via large language models as a potential solution.

Method: Fine-tuning GPT-4.1-mini to generate structured malware records for three families using prompt engineering and post-processing, followed by evaluation of various classifiers with different training data configurations.

Result: Near perfect detection was achieved with real-only data. Real-plus-synthetic data retained high performance with minor degradation, while synthetic-only training had mixed results, varying by malware family and tuning strategies.

Conclusion: LLM-generated malware data can enhance datasets for detection tasks but is insufficient alone as a standalone training source.

Abstract: Android malware continues to evolve through obfuscation and polymorphism,
posing challenges for both signature-based defenses and machine learning models
trained on limited and imbalanced datasets. Synthetic data has been proposed as
a remedy for scarcity, yet the role of large language models (LLMs) in
generating effective malware data for detection tasks remains underexplored. In
this study, we fine-tune GPT-4.1-mini to produce structured records for three
malware families: BankBot, Locker/SLocker, and Airpush/StopSMS, using the
KronoDroid dataset. After addressing generation inconsistencies with prompt
engineering and post-processing, we evaluate multiple classifiers under three
settings: training with real data only, real-plus-synthetic data, and synthetic
data alone. Results show that real-only training achieves near perfect
detection, while augmentation with synthetic data preserves high performance
with only minor degradations. In contrast, synthetic-only training produces
mixed outcomes, with effectiveness varying across malware families and
fine-tuning strategies. These findings suggest that LLM-generated malware can
enhance scarce datasets without compromising detection accuracy, but remains
insufficient as a standalone training source.

Result: CADL achieves 99.88% detection rate, 0.13% false positive rate, 89% accuracy in classifying attacker profiles, and outperforms traditional systems like Snort (71.2%) and Suricata (68.5%).

Conclusion: CADL provides an accessible, high-performing alternative to expensive commercial platforms for network security needs, with open-source implementation and reliable metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents CADL (Cognitive-Adaptive Deception Layer), an adaptive
deception framework achieving 99.88% detection rate with 0.13% false positive
rate on the CICIDS2017 dataset. The framework employs ensemble machine learning
(Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) combined with behavioral profiling to

enabling collective decision-making. The system profiles attackers based on
temporal patterns and deploys customized deception strategies across five
escalation levels. Evaluation on 50,000 CICIDS2017 test samples demonstrates
that CADL significantly outperforms traditional intrusion detection systems
(Snort: 71.2%, Suricata: 68.5%) while maintaining production-ready false
positive rates. The framework's behavioral analysis achieves 89% accuracy in
classifying attacker profiles. We provide open-source implementation and

### [372] [Untargeted Jailbreak Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02999)
*Xinzhe Huang,Wenjing Hu,Tianhang Zheng,Kedong Xiu,Xiaojun Jia,Di Wang,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA) on LLMs, aiming to elicit unsafe responses without following predefined patterns, outperforming existing methods by over 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks are limited by their focus on inducing predefined target responses, which restricts the adversarial search space and results in inefficiency.

Method: The study formulates an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability of the LLM response. It employs a judge model for evaluation and uses theoretical decomposition into differentiable sub-objectives for optimization.

Result: Extensive evaluations reveal that UJA achieves over 80% attack success rates against safety-aligned LLMs with just 100 optimization iterations, outperforming state-of-the-art attacks.

Conclusion: UJA expands the attack search space and demonstrates higher efficiency and flexibility in exploiting LLM vulnerabilities, marking a significant improvement over targeted approaches.

Abstract: Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs),
such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and COLD-Attack, typically optimize
adversarial suffixes to align the LLM output with a predefined target response.
However, by restricting the optimization objective as inducing a predefined
target, these methods inherently constrain the adversarial search space, which
limit their overall attack efficacy. Furthermore, existing methods typically
require a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap
between the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low
attack efficiency.
  To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the
first gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an
unsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we
formulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability
of the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the
objective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two
differentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and
the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate
the decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's
unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more
flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that \textsc{UJA} can achieve over 80\% attack success rates
against recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations,
outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and
COLD-Attack by over 20\%.

*Tianyi Li,Tianyu Liu,Yicheng Yang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This study analyzes the cyber-resilience of ACC systems in electric (EV) and ICE vehicles, identifying attack vectors, simulating scenarios, and exploring risk mitigation strategies. It finds EVs exhibit more stability than ICE vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates how ACC-equipped EVs and ICE vehicles differ in their resilience to cyberattacks due to differing powertrain responses, aiming to quantify vulnerabilities.

Method: Six novel attack vectors are formalized and implemented in a ring-road simulation, testing varying ACC market penetration rates and spatial patterns of compromised vehicles.

Result: EV platoons showed lower velocity standard deviation, reduced spacing oscillations, and faster recovery post-attack compared to ICE vehicle platoons.

Conclusion: The analysis highlights that EVs inherently offer better stability against attacks due to controller-to-powertrain coupling, providing insights for improving defense strategies in mixed automated traffic.

Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is rapidly proliferating across electric
vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, enhancing traffic
flow while simultaneously expanding the attack surface for communication-based
cyberattacks. Because the two powertrains translate control inputs into motion
differently, their cyber-resilience remains unquantified. Therefore, we
formalize six novel message-level attack vectors and implement them in a
ring-road simulation that systematically varies the ACC market penetration
rates (MPRs) and the spatial pattern of compromised vehicles. A three-tier risk
taxonomy converts disturbance metrics into actionable defense priorities for
practitioners. Across all simulation scenarios, EV platoons exhibit lower
velocity standard deviation, reduced spacing oscillations, and faster
post-attack recovery compared to ICE counterparts, revealing an inherent
stability advantage. These findings clarify how controller-to-powertrain
coupling influences vulnerability and offer quantitative guidance for the
detection and mitigation of attacks in mixed automated traffic.

### [374] [Periodic Event-Triggered Prescribed Time Control of Euler-Lagrange Systems under State and Input Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02769)
*Chidre Shravista Kashyap,Karnan A,Pushpak Jagtap,Jishnu Keshavan*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a periodic event-triggered adaptive control for Euler-Lagrangian systems with constraints, ensuring efficient trajectory tracking while rejecting disturbances without continuous monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Euler-Lagrangian systems require continuous real-time monitoring and control, which can be computationally intensive and impractical. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by designing an efficient, event-triggered periodic control scheme.

Method: The authors design an approximation-free adaptive barrier control that uses periodic evaluation of a triggering condition along with a time-varying threshold function. They also develop an upper bound for the monitoring period and ensure rejection of disturbances and convergence within a prescribed time without continuous updates.

Result: The proposed method ensures prescribed-time convergence of tracking errors to a desired bound, avoids Zeno behavior, and significantly reduces control update frequency during transient phases. Simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness of the method.

Conclusion: This periodic event-triggered strategy reduces computational overhead compared to traditional continuous control methods while maintaining robust and efficient trajectory tracking under constraints.

Abstract: This article proposes a periodic event-triggered adaptive barrier control
policy for the trajectory tracking problem of perturbed Euler-Lagrangian
systems with state, input, and temporal (SIT) constraints. In particular, an
approximation-free adaptive-barrier control architecture is designed to ensure
prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed bound while
rejecting exogenous disturbances. In contrast to existing approaches that
necessitate continuous real-time control action, the proposed controller
generates event-based updates through periodic evaluation of the triggering
condition. Additionally, we derive an upper bound on the monitoring period by
analysing the performance degradation of the filtered tracking error to
facilitate periodic evaluation of the event-triggered strategy. To this end, a
time-varying threshold function is considered in the triggering mechanism to
reduce the number of triggers during the transient phase of system behaviour.
Notably, the proposed design avoids Zeno behaviour and precludes the need for
continuous monitoring of the triggering condition. A simulation and
experimental study is undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
control scheme.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L) method to address quadrotor instability caused by dynamic disturbances and model uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based methods struggle with underfitting in high-dimensional feature spaces, limiting their identification capabilities.

Method: The high-dimensional mapping is decomposed into low-dimensional submappings ('slices') handled by shallow neural networks and adaptive laws that update online without pre-training or persistent excitation requirements.

Result: The approach achieves closed-loop exponential stability for the quadrotor system under dynamic disturbances and uncertainties, proven mathematically.

Conclusion: The Dimension-Decomposed Learning framework offers a novel solution for quadrotor stabilization, effectively addressing high-dimensional challenges without pre-training.

Abstract: Quadrotor stability under complex dynamic disturbances and model
uncertainties poses significant challenges. One of them remains the
underfitting problem in high-dimensional features, which limits the
identification capability of current learning-based methods. To address this,
we introduce a new perspective: Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L), from
which we develop the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM) approach for
geometric control. Specifically, the high-dimensional mapping for
identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings
(``slices"). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed
into a set of simple low-dimensional tasks addressed by shallow neural networks
and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online
via Lyapunov-based adaptation without any pre-training or persistent excitation
(PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we
prove that the full-state closed-loop system exhibits arbitrarily close to
exponential stability despite multi-dimensional time-varying disturbances and
model uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential
convergence without requiring pre-training for unknown disturbances and
specific knowledge of the model.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper presents an end-to-end deep learning framework for optimizing downlink beamforming in large-scale sparse MIMO channels using an Encoder-Decoder Network (EDN) structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address beamforming challenges in large-scale sparse MIMO channels, the authors sought to design an efficient deep learning-based method for accurate channel representation, beamformer generation, and reconstruction.

Method: The method uses an EDN with three components: encoder NN at user ends for channel compression, beamformer decoder NN at the BS for generating beamforming, and a channel decoder NN to reconstruct channels and refine beamformers. Training includes semi-amortized learning and a transition from supervised to unsupervised learning via knowledge distillation.

Result: The framework was validated through extensive simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse network configurations and channel conditions, including both far-field and near-field scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed EDN framework successfully optimizes downlink beamforming, providing a scalable and efficient solution for sparse MIMO systems with promising adaptability and performance.

Abstract: We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in
large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with
three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses
estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent
vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a
beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to
beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs
downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the
beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a)
semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical
gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge
distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an
unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers,
over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using
the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to
both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive
simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel
conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide robust RL-based tools for entropy-regularized LQC problems, demonstrating theoretical and empirical convergence even without prior system knowledge.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for
sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system
parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for
entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative
noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy
Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that
despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under
conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on
zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm:
Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without
knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees
of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate
convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent
in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automatic approach to create digital twins for testing and validating software in autonomous telecommunication networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift towards autonomous network operation has created a heightened need for effective testing and validation of software.

Method: The paper introduces automatic generation methods for digital twins, demonstrating alignment with ITU-T's experimentation framework.

Result: Experimental results validate the feasibility of creating efficient and accurate digital twins automatically.

Conclusion: Automatic digital twins can streamline validation pipelines in autonomous networks, reducing time and human effort.

Abstract: The increased use of software in the operation and management of
telecommunication networks has moved the industry one step closer to realizing
autonomous network operation. One consequence of this shift is the
significantly increased need for testing and validation before such software
can be deployed. Complementing existing simulation or hardware-based
approaches, digital twins present an environment to achieve this testing;
however, they require significant time and human effort to configure and
execute. This paper explores the automatic generation of digital twins to
provide efficient and accurate validation tools, aligned to the ITU-T
autonomous network architecture's experimentation subsystem. We present
experimental results for an initial use case, demonstrating that the approach
is feasible in automatically creating efficient digital twins with sufficient
accuracy to be included as part of existing validation pipelines.

*Conrado Catarcione Pinto,Amanda Camacho Novaes de Oliveira,Rodrigo Sapienza Luna,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper presents a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based method to identify asymptomatic individuals in epidemics using a Susceptible-Infected network model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge addressed is the difficulty in identifying asymptomatic individuals who contribute to epidemic spread and hinder effective public health interventions.

Method: A supervised learning approach with GNN is utilized, leveraging node features derived from a network with observed infected nodes.

Result: The methodology is shown to be robust across various network models, sizes, and proportions of observed infections, accurately detecting asymptomatic nodes.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based framework effectively classifies asymptomatic nodes, offering a generalizable solution for identifying hidden epidemic carriers in diverse network scenarios.

Abstract: Infected individuals in some epidemics can remain asymptomatic while still
carrying and transmitting the infection. These individuals contribute to the
spread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health
policies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and
controlling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy
individuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying
asymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected)
network epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed
as infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In
order to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node
features are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach
is evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of
observed infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust
across different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while
also generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed
infections.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: NeuroDNAAI proposes a framework for improving DNA digital information storage using quantum concepts and deep learning to address biological errors and constraints, achieving better accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA is considered a highly dense and durable medium for information storage, but practical deployment is hindered by synthesis costs, sequencing errors, and biological issues like GC-content imbalance and homopolymers.

Method: The framework utilizes quantum parallelism to enhance encoding diversity and integrates deep learning techniques that account for biological constraints, allowing robust encoding and decoding of DNA sequences in noisy channels.

Result: NeuroDNAAI demonstrates superior accuracy and lower bit error rates compared to traditional methods when reconstructing text and image data in biological noisy channels.

Conclusion: By combining theory, workflow, and simulations, NeuroDNAAI enables scalable and biologically valid workflows for archival DNA data storage, addressing both noise and biological constraints effectively.

Abstract: DNA is a promising medium for digital information storage for its exceptional
density and durability. While prior studies advanced coding theory, workflow
design, and simulation tools, challenges such as synthesis costs, sequencing
errors, and biological constraints (GC-content imbalance, homopolymers) limit
practical deployment. To address this, our framework draws from quantum
parallelism concepts to enhance encoding diversity and resilience, integrating
biologically informed constraints with deep learning to enhance error
mitigation in DNA storage. NeuroDNAAI encodes binary data streams into symbolic
DNA sequences, transmits them through a noisy channel with substitutions,
insertions, and deletions, and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Our
results show that traditional prompting or rule-based schemes fail to adapt
effectively to realistic noise, whereas NeuroDNAAI achieves superior accuracy.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate low bit error rates for both text
and images. By unifying theory, workflow, and simulation into one pipeline,
NeuroDNAAI enables scalable, biologically valid archival DNA storage

*Yuhao Zhou,Huangyan Shen,Qingliang Song,Qingshu Dong,Jianfeng Li,Weihua Li*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes improving the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) for sub-7nm technology nodes using a Gaussian template descriptor and Bayesian optimization (BO) combined with AB/AB binary blends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in fabricating circular holes with controlled size and positions using self-assembly of block copolymers, including difficulties in template design and ensuring manufacturability.

Method: A Gaussian descriptor with two parameters is proposed for template shape characterization, combined with AB/AB binary blends and Bayesian optimization for co-optimization of templates and blends.

Result: The method efficiently generates optimal templates for multi-hole patterns with highly matched morphologies while ensuring manufacturable designs. It also provides wide tunability of blend parameters under high precision requirements.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the potential of DSA technology and provides insights for advancing its practical applications in the semiconductor field.

Abstract: The directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) offers a highly
promising approach for the fabrication of contact holes or vertical
interconnect access at sub-7nm technology nodes. To fabricate circular holes
with precisely controlled size and positions, the self-assembly of block
copolymers requires guidance from a properly designed template. Effectively
parameterizing the template shape to enable efficient optimization remains a
critical yet challenging problem. Moreover, the optimized template must possess
excellent manufacturability for practical applications. In this work, we
propose a Gaussian descriptor for characterizing the template shape with only
two parameters. We further propose to use AB/AB binary blends instead of pure
diblock copolymer to improve the adaptability of the block copolymer system to
the template shape. The Bayesian optimization (BO) is applied to co-optimize
the binary blend and the template shape. Our results demonstrate that BO based
on the Gaussian descriptor can efficiently yield the optimal templates for
diverse multi-hole patterns, all leading to highly matched self-assembled
morphologies. Moreover, by imposing constraints on the variation of curvature
of the template during optimization, superior manufacturability is ensured for
each optimized template. It is noteworthy that each key parameter of the blend
exhibits a relatively wide tunable window under the requirement of rather high
precision. Our work provides valuable insights for advancing DSA technology,
and thus potentially propels its practical applications forward.

TL;DR: The paper explores Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) as an improved decoding method for real-world communication systems, surpassing traditional 5G polar decoders in reliability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance decoding in real-world communication systems by utilizing the advanced capabilities of Neural Polar Decoders, extending their application beyond synthetic channels.

Method: The study adapts NPDs for OFDM and single-carrier systems, introducing support for any code length, higher-order modulations, and diverse channel conditions. NPDs directly operate on channels with memory, leveraging their structure for better performance.

Result: Experimental results reveal that NPDs outperform standard 5G polar decoders in BER, BLER, and throughput, especially for low-rate and short-block configurations in 5G environments. They also achieve comparable performance to OFDM in single-carrier systems with advantages in PAPR.

Conclusion: NPDs are presented as a robust, high-performance decoding solution that eliminates the need for pilots and cyclic prefixes, making them suitable for 5G systems with enhanced reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we adapt and analyze Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) for
end-to-end communication systems. While prior work demonstrated the
effectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to
real-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and
single-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements,
the NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order
modulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates
directly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher
data rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails
higher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural
network architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics,
resulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental
results over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the
5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are
particularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are
prevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier
systems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling
effective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position
the NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution.

*Jian'an Zhang*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: FR-LUX is a reinforcement learning framework designed for friction-aware and regime-conditioned trading, achieving high performance across varying market conditions and execution costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paper portfolios often fail in live settings due to transaction costs and sudden regime shifts. The aim is to create a robust trading framework that addresses these issues.

Method: FR-LUX comprises a reinforcement learning framework with three elements: an execution cost model in the reward; a trust-region strategy limiting inventory flows for stability; and explicit conditioning for regime adaptation.

Result: FR-LUX outperforms benchmarks on Sharpe ratios, risk-return efficiency, and turnover management, providing statistically significant scenario-wise improvements.

Conclusion: The framework is practical, robust in various cost scenarios, and supported by formal guarantees, making it effective for live trading environments.

Abstract: Transaction costs and regime shifts are major reasons why paper portfolios
fail in live trading. We introduce FR-LUX (Friction-aware, Regime-conditioned
Learning under eXecution costs), a reinforcement learning framework that learns
after-cost trading policies and remains robust across volatility-liquidity
regimes. FR-LUX integrates three ingredients: (i) a microstructure-consistent
execution model combining proportional and impact costs, directly embedded in
the reward; (ii) a trade-space trust region that constrains changes in
inventory flow rather than logits, yielding stable low-turnover updates; and
(iii) explicit regime conditioning so the policy specializes to LL/LH/HL/HH
states without fragmenting the data. On a 4 x 5 grid of regimes and cost levels
with multiple random seeds, FR-LUX achieves the top average Sharpe ratio with
narrow bootstrap confidence intervals, maintains a flatter cost-performance
slope than strong baselines, and attains superior risk-return efficiency for a
given turnover budget. Pairwise scenario-level improvements are strictly
positive and remain statistically significant after multiple-testing
corrections. We provide formal guarantees on optimality under convex frictions,
monotonic improvement under a KL trust region, long-run turnover bounds and
induced inaction bands due to proportional costs, positive value advantage for
regime-conditioned policies, and robustness to cost misspecification. The
methodology is implementable: costs are calibrated from standard liquidity
proxies, scenario-level inference avoids pseudo-replication, and all figures
and tables are reproducible from released artifacts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisitHGNN, a graph neural network model designed to estimate probabilities of urban neighborhood visits to specific points of interest, using mobility data from Fulton County, Georgia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding urban travel patterns is essential for improving transportation planning, mobility management, and public health.

Method: The method involves using VisitHGNN, a graph neural network incorporating spatial, temporal, and functional relations among places. It leverages POI and CBG attributes connected through specialized edges to predict visit probabilities.

Result: VisitHGNN demonstrates strong predictive performance with metrics such as KL divergence (0.287), MAE (0.008), and Top-1 accuracy (0.853), outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: The model accurately mirrors observed urban travel patterns, offering significant potential for decision-making in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility systems, and public health.

Abstract: Understanding how urban residents travel between neighborhoods and
destinations is critical for transportation planning, mobility management, and
public health. By mining historical origin-to-destination flow patterns with
spatial, temporal, and functional relations among urban places, we estimate
probabilities of visits from neighborhoods to specific destinations. These
probabilities capture neighborhood-level contributions to citywide vehicular
and foot traffic, supporting demand estimation, accessibility assessment, and
multimodal planning. Particularly, we introduce VisitHGNN, a heterogeneous,
relation-specific graph neural network designed to predict visit probabilities
at individual Points of interest (POIs). POIs are characterized using
numerical, JSON-derived, and textual attributes, augmented with fixed summaries
of POI--POI spatial proximity, temporal co-activity, and brand affinity, while
census block groups (CBGs) are described with 72 socio-demographic variables.
CBGs are connected via spatial adjacency, and POIs and CBGs are linked through
distance-annotated cross-type edges. Inference is constrained to a
distance-based candidate set of plausible origin CBGs, and training minimizes a
masked Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to yield probability distribution
across the candidate set. Using weekly mobility data from Fulton County,
Georgia, USA, VisitHGNN achieves strong predictive performance with mean KL
divergence of 0.287, MAE of 0.008, Top-1 accuracy of 0.853, and R-square of
0.892, substantially outperforming pairwise MLP and distance-only baselines,
and aligning closely with empirical visitation patterns (NDCG@50 = 0.966);
Recall@5 = 0.611). The resulting distributions closely mirror observed travel
behavior with high fidelity, highlighting the model's potential for decision
support in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility system design, and
public health.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) representation to model stiffened panels, showing superior predictive performance and accuracy in stress and displacement fields compared to homogeneous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of modeling structural analysis and optimization for stiffened panels that display geometrical variability, diverse loads, and non-uniform boundary conditions.

Method: A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) approach is proposed, where the structure is divided into structural units represented by nodes and edges. Heterogeneity in nodes and edges is incorporated in a graph transformer network for predicting displacement and von Mises stress fields.

Result: The heterogeneous graph model outperformed homogeneous counterparts and effectively captured structural behavior patterns and extreme values. Numerical experiments demonstrated strong predictive accuracy across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for predicting structural responses, with graph heterogeneity playing a crucial role in model performance.

Abstract: Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We
propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts
for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse
loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The
structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and
the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node
types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced
by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting
nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees
of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are
implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises
stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and
degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach,
we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams
composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The
heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart,
demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was
performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The
results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises
stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.

TL;DR: This paper explores efficient audio waveform generation using linear RNNs, culminating in the proposed HarmonicRNN model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for generating raw audio waveforms face challenges due to sequence length and multiscale structure, so efficient and scalable solutions are needed.

Method: The authors refine linear RNN architectures and introduce context-parallelism to support training on long sequences, enabling better audio modeling.

Result: The HarmonicRNN model achieves enhanced log-likelihoods and perceptual metrics, surpassing previous methods on small-scale audio datasets.

Conclusion: HarmonicRNN demonstrates the potential of linear RNNs for autoregressive audio generation, particularly their capability to handle long sequences effectively.

Abstract: Directly learning to generate audio waveforms in an autoregressive manner is
a challenging task, due to the length of the raw sequences and the existence of
important structure on many different timescales. Traditional approaches based
on recurrent neural networks, as well as causal convolutions and
self-attention, have only had limited success on this task. However, recent
work has shown that deep state space models, also referred to as linear RNNs,
can be highly efficient in this context. In this work, we push the boundaries
of linear RNNs applied to raw audio modeling, investigating the effects of
different architectural choices and using context-parallelism to enable
training on sequences up to one minute (1M tokens) in length. We present a
model, HarmonicRNN, which attains state of the art log-likelihoods and
perceptual metrics on small-scale datasets.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flamed-TTS, a zero-shot TTS framework that focuses on low latency, computational efficiency, and high-quality speech with temporal diversity, surpassing state-of-the-art models in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address shortcomings in zero-shot TTS models, such as unreliable synthesis, slow inference, high computational overhead, and limited exploration of temporal diversity.

Method: Flamed-TTS reformulates the flow matching training paradigm and combines discrete and continuous speech representations to achieve efficient and natural synthesis.

Result: Flamed-TTS outperforms existing models in intelligibility, naturalness, speaker similarity, and acoustic characteristic preservation, achieving a WER of 4% and maintaining high fidelity and low latency.

Conclusion: Flamed-TTS presents a significant advancement in zero-shot TTS by addressing key challenges and offering state-of-the-art performance, with code and audio samples publicly available.

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) has recently advanced significantly, enabling
models to synthesize speech from text using short, limited-context prompts.
These prompts serve as voice exemplars, allowing the model to mimic speaker
identity, prosody, and other traits without extensive speaker-specific data.
Although recent approaches incorporating language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have proven their effectiveness in zero-shot TTS, they still encounter
challenges such as unreliable synthesis caused by token repetition or
unexpected content transfer, along with slow inference and substantial
computational overhead. Moreover, temporal diversity-crucial for enhancing the
naturalness of synthesized speech-remains largely underexplored. To address
these challenges, we propose Flamed-TTS, a novel zero-shot TTS framework that
emphasizes low computational cost, low latency, and high speech fidelity
alongside rich temporal diversity. To achieve this, we reformulate the flow
matching training paradigm and incorporate both discrete and continuous
representations corresponding to different attributes of speech. Experimental
results demonstrate that Flamed-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art models in terms
of intelligibility, naturalness, speaker similarity, acoustic characteristics
preservation, and dynamic pace. Notably, Flamed-TTS achieves the best WER of 4%
compared to the leading zero-shot TTS baselines, while maintaining low latency
in inference and high fidelity in generated speech. Code and audio samples are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of previous audio hiding methods, which result in poor quality of recovered secret audio due to inadequate modeling of time-frequency relationships.

Method: Developed a flow-based invertible neural network linking stego, cover, and secret audio, combined with a time-frequency loss to enhance quality and reversibility during embedding and extraction. Integrated encryption for additional security.

Result: Experimental results on VCTK and LibriSpeech datasets show that the new method achieves superior performance in audio recovery quality (subjective and objective metrics) and robustness against noise.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a significant improvement in secure audio data hiding, with practical applications due to enhanced quality, reversibility, and robustness.

Abstract: Data hiding is essential for secure communication across digital media, and
recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide enhanced methods for
embedding secret information effectively. However, previous audio hiding
methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio,
due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency
relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new
DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish
a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the
reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues
from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during
recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This
approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also
enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical
applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data
from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms
of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of
noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.

Method: Introduces a masked diffusion objective for audio-conditioned generation and uses a shortcut loss for efficient audio sample generation in as few as eight steps.

Result: SALSA-V outperforms state-of-the-art methods in audiovisual alignment, synchronization, and audio quality in both quantitative and human evaluations.

Conclusion: SALSA-V is effective for applications like Foley generation and sound design, offering versatile and high-quality video-to-audio synthesis.

Abstract: We propose SALSA-V, a multimodal video-to-audio generation model capable of
synthesizing highly synchronized, high-fidelity long-form audio from silent

audio-conditioned generation and the seamless synthesis of audio sequences of
unconstrained length. Additionally, by integrating a shortcut loss into our
training process, we achieve rapid generation of high-quality audio samples in
as few as eight sampling steps, paving the way for near-real-time applications
without requiring dedicated fine-tuning or retraining. We demonstrate that
SALSA-V significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
audiovisual alignment and synchronization with video content in quantitative
evaluation and a human listening study. Furthermore, our use of random masking
during training enables our model to match spectral characteristics of
reference audio samples, broadening its applicability to professional audio
synthesis tasks such as Foley generation and sound design.

Method: Stakeholders were consulted, and their perceptions on climate and land use changes were analyzed using machine learning to quantify their influence.

Result: Predominant climate feature was temperature, and dominant land use feature was deforestation. Stakeholders prioritized water-related problems and highlighted energy-related deficiencies as significant issues.

Conclusion: Stakeholders perceive negative impacts of climate and land use changes on ecosystem services, emphasizing biodiversity loss, water scarcity, and renewable energy concerns as major areas requiring management measures.

Abstract: To promote climate adaptation and mitigation, it is crucial to understand
stakeholder perspectives and knowledge gaps on land use and climate changes.
Stakeholders across 21 European islands were consulted on climate and land use
change issues affecting ecosystem services. Climate change perceptions included
temperature, precipitation, humidity, extremes, and wind. Land use change
perceptions included deforestation, coastal degradation, habitat protection,
renewable energy facilities, wetlands, and others. Additional concerns such as
invasive species, water or energy scarcity, infrastructure problems, and
austerity were also considered. Climate and land use change impact perceptions
were analysed with machine learning to quantify their influence. The
predominant climatic characteristic is temperature, and the predominant land
use characteristic is deforestation. Water-related problems are top priorities
for stakeholders. Energy-related problems, including energy deficiency and
issues with wind and solar facilities, rank high as combined climate and land
use risks. Stakeholders generally perceive climate change impacts on ecosystem
services as negative, with natural habitat destruction and biodiversity loss
identified as top issues. Land use change impacts are also negative but more
complex, with more explanatory variables. Stakeholders share common perceptions
on biodiversity impacts despite geographic disparity, but they differentiate
between climate and land use impacts. Water, energy, and renewable energy

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: This paper explores the complexity of stable instances of k-means and k-median clustering, introducing a generalized stability definition. While some special cases are solvable in polynomial time, the paper also establishes super-polynomial hardness results under the ETH.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to generalize and extend the understanding of stability in clustering problems (k-means and k-median), particularly in metrics with small doubling dimensions, and to address open questions about complexity and solvability of stable instances.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis, extending prior concepts of stability to an 'almost stable' notion and introducing penalties in clustering. They investigate solvable special cases and establish lower bounds under the ETH.

Result: Certain 'almost stable' k-means/k-median clustering problems (including penalty versions) are polynomially solvable, while others exhibit super-polynomial hardness under ETH.

Conclusion: The research offers new insights into the tractability and limits of stable clustering problem instances, advancing the understanding of their complexity in low-dimensional metrics.

Abstract: We investigate the complexity of stable (or perturbation-resilient) instances
of $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$ and $\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ clustering
problems in metrics with small doubling dimension. While these problems have
been extensively studied under multiplicative perturbation resilience in
low-dimensional Euclidean spaces (e.g., (Friggstad et al., 2019; Cohen-Addad
and Schwiegelshohn, 2017)), we adopt a more general notion of stability, termed
``almost stable'', which is closer to the notion of $(\alpha,
\varepsilon)$-perturbation resilience introduced by Balcan and Liang (2016).
Additionally, we extend our results to
$\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ with penalties, where
each data point is either assigned to a cluster centre or incurs a penalty.
  We show that certain special cases of almost stable
$\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties) are
solvable in polynomial time. To complement this, we also examine the hardness
of almost stable instances and $(1 + \frac{1}{poly(n)})$-stable instances of
$\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties),
proving super-polynomial lower bounds on the runtime of any exact algorithm
under the widely believed Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).

### [392] [NetCAS: Dynamic Cache and Backend Device Management in Networked Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02323)
*Joon Yong Hwang,Chanseo Park,Ikjun Yeom,Younghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: NetCAS is a dynamic I/O split framework that improves storage system performance under network contention by splitting I/O workloads between cache and backend storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance bottlenecks in storage systems that rely on caching, especially in remote storage environments with unpredictable network contention.

Method: NetCAS uses real-time network feedback and a precomputed Performance Profile to dynamically split I/O workloads between cache and backend storage. It employs a low-overhead batched round-robin scheduler to avoid per-request overheads.

Result: NetCAS achieves up to 174% higher performance than traditional caching methods and outperforms adaptive schemes like Orthus by up to 3.5X in fluctuating network conditions.

Conclusion: Dynamic I/O splitting, as implemented by NetCAS, offers significant performance improvements in storage systems by addressing both workload and network variability effectively.

Abstract: Modern storage systems often combine fast cache with slower backend devices
to accelerate I/O. As performance gaps narrow, concurrently accessing both
devices, rather than relying solely on cache hits, can improve throughput.
However, in data centers, remote backend storage accessed over networks suffers
from unpredictable contention, complicating this split. We present NetCAS, a
framework that dynamically splits I/O between cache and backend devices based
on real-time network feedback and a precomputed Perf Profile. Unlike
traditional hit-rate-based policies, NetCAS adapts split ratios to workload
configuration and networking performance. NetCAS employs a low-overhead batched
round-robin scheduler to enforce splits, avoiding per-request costs. It
achieves up to 174% higher performance than traditional caching in remote
storage environments and outperforms converging schemes like Orthus by up to
3.5X under fluctuating network conditions.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces WEE-Therapy, a multi-task Audio Language Model (AudioLLM) designed for advanced computational psychology, incorporating domain-specific expertise through a novel Weak Encoder Ensemble (WEE) mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing AudioLLMs, which struggle to understand domain-specific counseling features like complex emotions and professional techniques.

Method: The paper proposes the Weak Encoder Ensemble (WEE) mechanism that integrates a robust base encoder with lightweight specialized encoders and uses a dual-routing strategy for knowledge combination.

Result: WEE-Therapy outperforms existing models in tasks like emotion recognition, technique classification, risk detection, and summarization with minor parameter complexity.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates notable improvements in AI-assisted clinical analysis for computational psychology, validating the efficacy of its multi-task and ensemble approach.

Abstract: The advancement of computational psychology requires AI tools capable of
deeply understanding counseling dialogues. Existing audio language models
(AudioLLMs) often rely on single speech encoders pre-trained on general data,
struggling to capture domain-specific features like complex emotions and
professional techniques. To address this, we propose WEE-Therapy, a multi-task
AudioLLM incorporating a Weak Encoder Ensemble (WEE) mechanism. This
supplements a powerful base encoder with a pool of lightweight, specialized
encoders. A novel dual-routing strategy combines stable, data-independent
domain knowledge with dynamic, data-dependent expert selection. Evaluated on
emotion recognition, technique classification, risk detection, and
summarization, WEE-Therapy achieves significant performance gains across all
tasks with minimal parameter overhead, demonstrating strong potential for
AI-assisted clinical analysis.

*Lukas Buess,Jan Geier,David Bani-Harouni,Chantal Pellegrini,Matthias Keicher,Paula Andrea Perez-Toro,Nassir Navab,Andreas Maier,Tomas Arias-Vergara*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to create AI models using spoken radiology reports, bridging the gap between speech and visual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the dominance of spoken communication in clinical workflows, especially in radiology, while current AI relies almost solely on written text.

Method: A new dataset (Speech-RATE) was synthesized, and a model called SpeechCT-CLIP was trained to align speech with 3D CT images using contrastive learning, supported by knowledge distillation from a pretrained text-based CLIP model.

Result: The proposed approach recovered 88% of the performance gap between speech- and text-trained models, improving zero-shot classification F1 score from 0.623 to 0.705, and achieved strong retrieval performance without requiring textual input during inference.

Conclusion: Speech can serve as a viable alternative to text in medical AI, enabling the development of voice-driven diagnostic tools for clinical use.

Abstract: Spoken communication plays a central role in clinical workflows. In
radiology, for example, most reports are created through dictation. Yet, nearly
all medical AI systems rely exclusively on written text. In this work, we
address this gap by exploring the feasibility of learning visual-language
representations directly from spoken radiology reports. Specifically, we
synthesize a large-scale dataset (Speech-RATE) of spoken radiology reports and
train SpeechCT-CLIP, a contrastive model that aligns speech and 3D CT volumes
in a shared representation space. While naive speech-based models underperform
compared to text-trained counterparts, we show that knowledge distillation from
a pretrained text-image CLIP model effectively transfers semantic alignment
capabilities from text to speech, substantially narrowing this gap. Experiments
demonstrate improved zero-shot classification F1 from 0.623 to 0.705,
recovering 88% of the performance difference, and strong retrieval results
without requiring text at inference. These findings highlight speech as a
practical alternative to text in multimodal pretraining and open the door to
voice-driven diagnostic support tools in clinical practice.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This study fine-tuned a multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) to analyze OCT scans, providing high-accuracy image quality assessment, glaucoma detection, and sectoral descriptions of retinal nerve fiber layer thinning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for explainable AI tools in ophthalmology that can assess imaging quality, diagnose glaucoma, and objectively evaluate RNFL thinning through structured clinical reporting.

Method: The MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was fine-tuned using paired OCT images and generated clinical reports, including labeled poor-quality scans and automated clinical descriptions for training. Performance was tested on quality triage, glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy (0.90 for quality triage and 0.86 for glaucoma detection), strong sensitivity and specificity, and high alignment with human-written reports as evaluated by BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore metrics.

Conclusion: The MM-LLM demonstrated robust capabilities in identifying optic nerve head OCT scan quality, diagnosing glaucoma, and generating structured descriptions of RNFL thinning, offering potential advantages for clinical applications.

Abstract: Objective: To develop an explainable multimodal large language model (MM-LLM)
that (1) screens optic nerve head (ONH) OCT circle scans for quality and (2)
generates structured clinical reports that include glaucoma diagnosis and
sector-wise retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning assessments. Design:
Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH
OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and
ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was
fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data
included paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical
reports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans
were labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model
was evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment,
glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical
sectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using
standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and
0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86
(sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction
accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and
temporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference
reports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1:
0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical
descriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in
identifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also
provided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT
evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using the Orthogonal Procrustes problem as a lightweight method to ensure synthetic data preserves Pearson correlation relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of maintaining statistical relationships, specifically Pearson correlation, when generating synthetic data.

Method: They leverage the Orthogonal Procrustes problem as a post-processing step to adjust synthetic data for accurate Pearson correlation preservation.

Result: Empirical evaluations on a real-world energy consumption dataset show that the methodology effectively enforces desired statistical relationships.

Conclusion: The approach enhances synthetic data generation by complementing existing generative models without replacing them, enabling improved statistical fidelity of synthetic data.

Abstract: This work introduces the application of the Orthogonal Procrustes problem to
the generation of synthetic data. The proposed methodology ensures that the
resulting synthetic data preserves important statistical relationships among
features, specifically the Pearson correlation. An empirical illustration using
a large, real-world, tabular dataset of energy consumption demonstrates the
effectiveness of the approach and highlights its potential for application in
practical synthetic data generation. Our approach is not meant to replace
existing generative models, but rather as a lightweight post-processing step
that enforces exact Pearson correlation to an already generated synthetic
dataset.

*Shuangshuang Xu,Marco A. R. Ferreira,Allison N. Tegge*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper compares variable selection methods, focusing on correct variable identification, recall, and false discovery rates, to improve replicability in research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding underlying mechanisms in data is crucial in scientific research, with variable selection being a key step for identifying associated regression variables.

Method: Simulation studies were performed involving different evaluation criteria (BIC, AIC) and search approaches (e.g., exhaustive, greedy, LASSO) across varied sample sizes and model complexities.

Result: Exhaustive search using BIC and stochastic search via BIC outperformed other methods in accuracy and reducing false discoveries across small and large model spaces.

Conclusion: Selecting the right variable selection method, especially BIC-based exhaustive and stochastic searches, enhances correct identification and reduces errors, aiding research replicability efforts.

Abstract: For many scientific questions, understanding the underlying mechanism is the
goal. To help investigators better understand the underlying mechanism,
variable selection is a crucial step that permits the identification of the
most associated regression variables of interest. A variable selection method
consists of model evaluation using an information criterion and a search of the
model space. Here, we provide a comprehensive comparison of variable selection
methods using performance measures of correct identification rate (CIR),
recall, and false discovery rate (FDR). We consider the BIC and AIC for
evaluating models, and exhaustive, greedy, LASSO path, and stochastic search
approaches for searching the model space; we also consider LASSO using cross
validation. We perform simulation studies for linear and generalized linear
models that parametrically explore a wide range of realistic sample sizes,
effect sizes, and correlations among regression variables. We consider model
spaces with a small and larger number of potential regressors. The results show
that the exhaustive search BIC and stochastic search BIC outperform the other
methods when considering the performance measures on small and large model
spaces, respectively. These approaches result in the highest CIR and lowest
FDR, which collectively may support long-term efforts towards increasing
replicability in research.

### [398] [Total Robustness in Bayesian Nonlinear Regression for Measurement Error Problems under Model Misspecification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03131)
*Mengqi Chen,Charita Dellaporta,Thomas B. Berrett,Theodoros Damoulas*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel Bayesian nonparametric framework addressing covariate measurement error, regression model misspecification, and measurement error distribution misspecification in nonlinear regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a robust regression framework that simultaneously addresses multiple sources of error and misspecification, which are common challenges in regression analyses with imperfect data.

Method: The framework employs a Dirichlet process prior on the latent covariate-response distribution, updated using posterior pseudo-samples, facilitating observation-informed latent inputs and leveraging a gradient-based algorithm for computational efficiency.

Result: The approach demonstrates enhanced robustness, lower estimation error, and reduced sensitivity to misspecification in both simulated and real-world data compared to alternative Bayesian and frequentist methods.

Conclusion: This framework offers a reliable and interpretable approach for regression analysis, ensuring robustness and consistency even when dealing with imperfect data and models.

Abstract: Modern regression analyses are often undermined by covariate measurement
error, misspecification of the regression model, and misspecification of the
measurement error distribution. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the
first Bayesian nonparametric framework targeting total robustness that tackles
all three challenges in general nonlinear regression. The framework assigns a
Dirichlet process prior to the latent covariate-response distribution and
updates it with posterior pseudo-samples of the latent covariates, thereby
providing the Dirichlet process posterior with observation-informed latent
inputs and yielding estimators that minimise the discrepancy between Dirichlet
process realisations and the model-induced joint law. This design allows
practitioners to (i) encode prior beliefs, (ii) choose between pseudo-sampling
latent covariates or working directly with error-prone observations, and (iii)
tune the influence of prior and data. We establish generalisation bounds that
tighten whenever the prior or pseudo-sample generator aligns with the
underlying data generating process, ensuring robustness without sacrificing
consistency. A gradient-based algorithm enables efficient computations;
simulations and two real-world studies show lower estimation error and reduced
estimation sensitivity to misspecification compared to Bayesian and frequentist
competitors. The framework, therefore, offers a practical and interpretable
paradigm for trustworthy regression when data and models are jointly imperfect.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper highlights that AI's Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities are misconstrued as genuine cognition, suggesting that assessments should focus on human-AI interaction instead of isolated AI capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misinterpretation of AI systems achieving human-level Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities based on behavioral mimicry and flawed cognitive test paradigms.

Method: The paper critiques current assessment paradigms and proposes a shift to mutual ToM frameworks that factor in the interplay between human cognition and AI algorithms.

Result: Findings reveal that LLMs mimic ToM abilities without genuine mental states, and current paradigms fail to capture interaction dynamics.

Conclusion: AI cognitive testing should pivot towards mutual ToM frameworks and emphasize assessing interaction dynamics instead of isolated behavioral mimicry.

Abstract: When researchers claim AI systems possess ToM or mental models, they are
fundamentally discussing behavioral predictions and bias corrections rather
than genuine mental states. This position paper argues that the current
discourse conflates sophisticated pattern matching with authentic cognition,
missing a crucial distinction between simulation and experience. While recent
studies show LLMs achieving human-level performance on ToM laboratory tasks,
these results are based only on behavioral mimicry. More importantly, the
entire testing paradigm may be flawed in applying individual human cognitive
tests to AI systems, but assessing human cognition directly in the moment of
human-AI interaction. I suggest shifting focus toward mutual ToM frameworks
that acknowledge the simultaneous contributions of human cognition and AI
algorithms, emphasizing the interaction dynamics, instead of testing AI in
isolation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents a metaphor-driven system that enables users to imagine and prototype alternative social media environments using LLM-driven simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media designs focus heavily on engagement and scalability, limiting exploration of alternative social spaces.

Method: The system uses user-provided metaphors to generate platform features and create interactive simulations with LLM-powered agents. Users interact with simulated environments in studies.

Result: Findings revealed that metaphors helped express social expectations and that simulation authenticity depended on factors like intimacy, participation, and temporal engagement.

Conclusion: Metaphor-driven simulation is a promising design tool for prototyping innovative social media architectures and broadening the design scope for future platforms.

Abstract: Social media platforms are central to communication, yet their designs remain
narrowly focused on engagement and scale. While researchers have proposed
alternative visions for online spaces, these ideas are difficult to prototype
within platform constraints. In this paper, we introduce a metaphor-driven
system to help users imagine and explore new social media environments. The
system translates users' metaphors into structured sets of platform features
and generates interactive simulations populated with LLM-driven agents. To
evaluate this approach, we conducted a study where participants created and
interacted with simulated social media spaces. Our findings show that metaphors
allow users to express distinct social expectations, and that perceived
authenticity of the simulation depended on how well it captured dynamics like
intimacy, participation, and temporal engagement. We conclude by discussing how
metaphor-driven simulation can be a powerful design tool for prototyping
alternative social architectures and expanding the design space for future
social platforms.

### [401] [Quantitative Convergence Analysis of Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent for Non-Convex Losses via the Goldstein Subdifferential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02735)
*Yuping Zheng,Andrew Lamperski*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes projected SGD (stochastic gradient descent) for non-convex losses, providing new convergence metrics and bounds without requiring variance reduction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing convergence analyses of projected SGD, such as reliance on variance-reduction methods or alternative gradient constructions (e.g., Moreau envelopes) that are not directly comparable to unconstrained SGD.

Method: The paper introduces a new convergence criterion based on the Goldstein subdifferential (associated with constraints) and proves convergence for both asymptotic and non-asymptotic conditions, considering IID, $L$-mixing, and sub-Gaussian data distributions.

Result: Results include asymptotic convergence and $O(N^{-1/3})$ non-asymptotic bounds (expectation), and for sub-Gaussian data, stronger results including almost-sure convergence and high-probability $O(N^{-1/5})$ non-asymptotic bounds.

Conclusion: The work provides a significant contribution by offering the first high-probability non-asymptotic bounds for projected SGD with non-convex losses, applicable without variance reduction, thereby bridging a gap in theoretical understanding.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the main algorithm behind a large body
of work in machine learning. In many cases, constraints are enforced via
projections, leading to projected stochastic gradient algorithms. In recent
years, a large body of work has examined the convergence properties of
projected SGD for non-convex losses in asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings.
Strong quantitative guarantees are available for convergence measured via
Moreau envelopes. However, these results cannot be compared directly with work
on unconstrained SGD, since the Moreau envelope construction changes the
gradient. Other common measures based on gradient mappings have the limitation
that convergence can only be guaranteed if variance reduction methods, such as
mini-batching, are employed. This paper presents an analysis of projected SGD
for non-convex losses over compact convex sets. Convergence is measured via the
distance of the gradient to the Goldstein subdifferential generated by the
constraints. Our proposed convergence criterion directly reduces to commonly
used criteria in the unconstrained case, and we obtain convergence without
requiring variance reduction. We obtain results for data that are independent,
identically distributed (IID) or satisfy mixing conditions ($L$-mixing). In
these cases, we derive asymptotic convergence and $O(N^{-1/3})$ non-asymptotic
bounds in expectation, where $N$ is the number of steps. In the case of IID
sub-Gaussian data, we obtain almost-sure asymptotic convergence and
high-probability non-asymptotic $O(N^{-1/5})$ bounds. In particular, these are
the first non-asymptotic high-probability bounds for projected SGD with
non-convex losses.

*Francisco Patitucci,Ruichen Jiang,Aryan Mokhtari*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper improves upon existing nonconvex optimization techniques by presenting a unified algorithm based on an online optimistic gradient method, achieving efficient complexities for both deterministic and stochastic cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing online-to-nonconvex conversion frameworks which involve complexity, strong assumptions, and different algorithms for deterministic and stochastic settings.

Method: Introduced a doubly optimistic hint function using gradients at extrapolated points, assuming constant differences between the hint and target gradient, and slow changes in update directions.

Result: Developed a unified method that eliminates double-loop schemes and achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1.75} + \sigma^2 \varepsilon^{-3.5})$ under standard variance assumptions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach unifies deterministic and stochastic methods under a single algorithm and achieves state-of-the-art complexities without requiring overly strong assumptions or extra logarithmic factors.

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in nonconvex optimization is the online-to-nonconvex
conversion framework of \cite{cutkosky2023optimal}, which reformulates the task
of finding an $\varepsilon$-first-order stationary point as an online learning
problem. When both the gradient and the Hessian are Lipschitz continuous,
instantiating this framework with two different online learners achieves a
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1.75}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ in the
deterministic case and a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3.5})$ in the
stochastic case. However, this approach suffers from several limitations: (i)
the deterministic method relies on a complex double-loop scheme that solves a
fixed-point equation to construct hint vectors for an optimistic online
learner, introducing an extra logarithmic factor; (ii) the stochastic method
assumes a bounded second-order moment of the stochastic gradient, which is
stronger than standard variance bounds; and (iii) different online learning
algorithms are used in the two settings. In this paper, we address these issues
by introducing an online optimistic gradient method based on a novel
\textit{doubly optimistic hint function}. Specifically, we use the gradient at
an extrapolated point as the hint, motivated by two optimistic assumptions:
that the difference between the hint and the target gradient remains near
constant, and that consecutive update directions change slowly due to
smoothness. Our method eliminates the need for a double loop and removes the
logarithmic factor. Furthermore, by simply replacing full gradients with
stochastic gradients and under the standard assumption that their variance is
bounded by $\sigma^2$, we obtain a unified algorithm with complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1.75} + \sigma^2 \varepsilon^{-3.5})$, smoothly
interpolating between the best-known deterministic rate and the optimal
stochastic rate.

*Abhinav Arun,Reetu Raj Harsh,Bhaskarjit Sarmah,Stefano Pasquali*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces FinReflectKG - MultiHop, a benchmark for efficient multi-hop reasoning over financial data using a knowledge graph-guided approach to improve accuracy and reduce token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address inefficiencies in multi-hop reasoning for financial QA, where relevant information is dispersed across various documents and noisy contexts make reasoning models less effective. Knowledge graphs offer a potentially more efficient solution.

Method: The authors created a benchmark using FinReflectKG, a financial knowledge graph, linked to contextual data from S&P 100 filings. They crafted QA pairs based on mined subgraph patterns and evaluated retrieving scenarios like KG-linked paths, page windows, and randomized text spans.

Result: KG-guided retrieval improved answer correctness by 24% and significantly cut token usage by 84.5% compared to traditional page window retrieval methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of knowledge graph-guided approaches for financial question answering.

Conclusion: Knowledge graphs are critical for enabling efficient multi-hop reasoning in financial QA tasks. They enhance retrieval accuracy and reduce resource usage, making them a valuable tool for the domain. A subset of the benchmark is released for further research.

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning over financial disclosures is often a retrieval problem
before it becomes a reasoning or generation problem: relevant facts are
dispersed across sections, filings, companies, and years, and LLMs often expend
excessive tokens navigating noisy context. Without precise Knowledge Graph
(KG)-guided selection of relevant context, even strong reasoning models either
fail to answer or consume excessive tokens, whereas KG-linked evidence enables
models to focus their reasoning on composing already retrieved facts. We
present FinReflectKG - MultiHop, a benchmark built on FinReflectKG, a
temporally indexed financial KG that links audited triples to source chunks
from S&P 100 filings (2022-2024). Mining frequent 2-3 hop subgraph patterns
across sectors (via GICS taxonomy), we generate financial analyst style
questions with exact supporting evidence from the KG. A two-phase pipeline
first creates QA pairs via pattern-specific prompts, followed by a
multi-criteria quality control evaluation to ensure QA validity. We then
evaluate three controlled retrieval scenarios: (S1) precise KG-linked paths;
(S2) text-only page windows centered on relevant text spans; and (S3) relevant
page windows with randomizations and distractors. Across both reasoning and
non-reasoning models, KG-guided precise retrieval yields substantial gains on
the FinReflectKG - MultiHop QA benchmark dataset, boosting correctness scores
by approximately 24 percent while reducing token utilization by approximately
84.5 percent compared to the page window setting, which reflects the
traditional vector retrieval paradigm. Spanning intra-document, inter-year, and
cross-company scopes, our work underscores the pivotal role of knowledge graphs
in efficiently connecting evidence for multi-hop financial QA. We also release
a curated subset of the benchmark (555 QA Pairs) to catalyze further research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel strategy for optimizing battery energy storage systems' profits in electricity markets, integrating the primary reserve and intraday markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in battery energy storage systems' participation in electricity markets, particularly due to limited integration of primary reserve and intraday markets.

Method: Developed a joint bidding strategy using mixed integer linear programming for intraday market operations and a learned classifier strategy for capacity allocation between markets.

Result: Backed by historical market data, the approach improves profits by over 4% against static strategies and narrows the gap to perfect foresight benchmarks by 4%.

Conclusion: Dynamic and learning-based strategies significantly enhance battery storage system profitability in multi-market settings.

Abstract: As renewable energy integration increases supply variability, battery energy
storage systems (BESS) present a viable solution for balancing supply and
demand. This paper proposes a novel approach for optimizing battery BESS
participation in multiple electricity markets. We develop a joint bidding
strategy that combines participation in the primary frequency reserve market
with continuous trading in the intraday market, addressing a gap in the extant
literature which typically considers these markets in isolation or simplifies
the continuous nature of intraday trading. Our approach utilizes a mixed
integer linear programming implementation of the rolling intrinsic algorithm
for intraday decisions and state of charge recovery, alongside a learned
classifier strategy (LCS) that determines optimal capacity allocation between
markets. A comprehensive out-of-sample backtest over more than one year of
historical German market data validates our approach: The LCS increases overall
profits by over 4% compared to the best-performing static strategy and by more
than 3% over a naive dynamic benchmark. Crucially, our method closes the gap to
a theoretical perfect foresight strategy to just 4%, demonstrating the
effectiveness of dynamic, learning-based allocation in a complex, multi-market
environment.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting and characterizing faint and overlapping astronomical objects in petabytes of high-resolution images generated by upcoming surveys.

Method: The paper proposes an amortized variational inference procedure with spatially autoregressive variational distributions, organized in a K-color checkerboard pattern, and optimized using neural posterior estimation (NPE).

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and demonstrates improved posterior calibration.

Conclusion: The proposed spatially autoregressive structure effectively enhances object detection and posterior calibration in small-object astronomical detection.

Abstract: Upcoming astronomical surveys will produce petabytes of high-resolution
images of the night sky, providing information about billions of stars and
galaxies. Detecting and characterizing the astronomical objects in these images
is a fundamental task in astronomy -- and a challenging one, as most of these
objects are faint and many visually overlap with other objects. We propose an
amortized variational inference procedure to solve this instance of
small-object detection. Our key innovation is a family of spatially
autoregressive variational distributions that partition and order the latent
space according to a $K$-color checkerboard pattern. By construction, the
conditional independencies of this variational family mirror those of the
posterior distribution. We fit the variational distribution, which is
parameterized by a convolutional neural network, using neural posterior
estimation (NPE) to minimize an expectation of the forward KL divergence. Using
images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. We further demonstrate that the proposed autoregressive structure
greatly improves posterior calibration.

### [406] [Less LLM, More Documents: Searching for Improved RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02657)
*Jingjie Ning,Yibo Kong,Yunfan Long,Jamie Callan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Expands retriever's corpus within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to achieve comparable accuracy to larger LLMs while managing costs and scalability limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in cost and deployability of scaling large language models (LLMs) for RAG by focusing on corpus enlargement.

Method: Scale the retrieval corpus to examine its impact on RAG performance, comparing small- to mid-sized generators with larger LLMs.

Result: Corpus scaling yields significant gains in RAG performance, rivaling larger LLM-based models, although benefits diminish at extreme corpus sizes.

Conclusion: Investing in larger retrieval corpora constitutes a viable path to enhance RAG systems, often as effective as increasing LLM size.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples document retrieval with large
language models (LLMs). While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also
raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging
the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results
show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a
substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger
scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival
much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the
most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that
improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing
passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These
findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger
corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging
the LLM itself.

### [407] [AgenticRAG: Tool-Augmented Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Explainable Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02668)
*Bo Ma,Hang Li,ZeHua Hu,XiaoFan Gui,LuYao Liu,Simon Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A framework called AgenticRAG leverages foundation models combined with retrieval-augmented generation to provide explainable and effective recommendation systems without task-specific training, yielding improved performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are not widely applied in recommendation systems due to issues with reasoning transparency and inherent knowledge limitations, motivating the need for a novel framework.

Method: AgenticRAG integrates tool usage, external knowledge retrieval, and chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling zero-shot explainable recommendations without the need for task-specific training.

Result: AgenticRAG outperforms existing baselines on three real-world datasets, showing NDCG@10 improvements of up to 1.6% while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: AgenticRAG is an effective, explainable, and computationally efficient framework for recommendations, showcasing the potential of foundation models in recommender systems.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their
application in recommender systems remains limited by reasoning opacity and
knowledge constraints. This paper introduces AgenticRAG, a novel framework that
combines tool-augmented foundation models with retrieval-augmented generation
for zero-shot explainable recommendations. Our approach integrates external
tool invocation, knowledge retrieval, and chain-of-thought reasoning to create
autonomous recommendation agents capable of transparent decision-making without
task-specific training. Experimental results on three real-world datasets
demonstrate that AgenticRAG achieves consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with NDCG@10 improvements of 0.4\% on Amazon
Electronics, 0.8\% on MovieLens-1M, and 1.6\% on Yelp datasets. The framework
exhibits superior explainability while maintaining computational efficiency
comparable to traditional methods.

### [408] [Scalable Quantum Optimisation using HADOF: Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02926)
*Namasi G Sankar,Georgios Miliotis,Simon Caton*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework (HADOF), which partitions large QUBO problems into smaller subproblems suitable for NISQ systems, and demonstrates its scalability and potential on both classical and quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restricted qubit counts in current NISQ systems prevent practical execution of quantum optimisation algorithms on large QUBO problems. There is a need for scalable frameworks to extend their applicability.

Method: HADOF decomposes large QUBO Hamiltonians into smaller sub-Hamiltonians, which are individually optimized using techniques like QAOA, QA, or SA, and then recombined into a global solution.

Result: HADOF demonstrates scalability to problem sizes beyond the qubit capacity of current NISQ systems while maintaining competitive accuracy and runtime compared to classical solvers. The validity of HADOF is showcased on an IBM quantum computer using a toy problem.

Conclusion: HADOF offers a promising approach to extend quantum optimisation to larger problem sizes, bridging the gap between current quantum hardware limitations and practical applications.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) and QAOA are promising quantum optimisation algorithms
used for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial problems on near-term
NISQ systems. Many NP-hard problems can be reformulated as Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO), which maps naturally onto quantum
Hamiltonians. However, the limited qubit counts of current NISQ devices
restrict practical deployment of such algorithms. In this study, we present the
Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework (HADOF), which leverages
an iterative strategy to automatically divide the Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimisation (QUBO) Hamiltonian into sub-Hamiltonians which can be
optimised separately using Hamiltonian based optimisers such as QAOA, QA or
Simulated Annealing (SA) and aggregated into a global solution. We compare
HADOF with Simulated Annealing (SA) and the CPLEX exact solver, showing
scalability to problem sizes far exceeding available qubits while maintaining
competitive accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we realise HADOF for a toy
problem on an IBM quantum computer, showing promise for practical applications
of quantum optimisation.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper discusses how sensor data platforms improve vineyard management by offering actionable insights for tasks such as irrigation, pest control, and harvest timing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance decision-making in viticulture by leveraging sensor data for precision and efficiency.

Method: The study summarizes the functions and practical use cases of sensor data platforms in viticulture.

Result: Sensor platforms provide anticipatory guidance, efficient resource usage, and align with precision viticulture principles.

Conclusion: Sensor data platforms improve operational decision-making in viticulture, benefiting both practitioners and researchers.

Abstract: Use of sensor and related analytical predictions can be a powerful tool in
providing data-informed input to viticulturalists' decision process,
complementing their vineyard observations and intuition. Their up-to-date
measurements, predictions, and alerts offer actionable insights and suggestions
for managing key vineyard operations, such as irrigation, disease and pest
control, canopy management, and harvest timing. In many cases, anticipatory
interventions can mitigate risks before problems become apparent. By offering
guidance on the targeting, timing, and dosage of vineyard practices, sensor
data platforms can enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency while
conserving labor and resources when they are not required. They also enable
implementation of the principles of precision viticulture - doing the right
thing, at the right time, in the right place. This paper provides a succinct
summary of the functions, benefits, and practical considerations of sensor data
platforms in viticulture. It may be of interest to viticulturalists as well as
agricultural and IoT researchers.

### [410] [Representing Beauty: Towards a Participatory but Objective Latent Aesthetics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02869)
*Alexander Michael Rusnak*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper examines how neural networks model beauty and aesthetic judgment, suggesting that beautiful images have a realist structure that transcends social constructs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the nature of beauty and whether deep learning systems can genuinely recognize aesthetic judgment across diverse objects.

Method: Analyzed the alignment of representations between neural networks trained on distinct datasets and modalities, focusing on the convergence of representations for aesthetic versus unaesthetic content.

Result: Aesthetic images led to more aligned representations between models, suggesting a realist basis for beauty grounded in both physical and cultural substance.

Conclusion: Human perceptual and creative acts largely shape deep learning systems' representations, but these systems are capable of novel creativity, making human-machine co-creation deeply interconnected and foundational to understanding aesthetics.

Abstract: What does it mean for a machine to recognize beauty? While beauty remains a
culturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept,
deep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic
judgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to
represent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the
term applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational
convergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned
representations between models which have been trained on distinct data and
modalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned
representations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful
images has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially
constructed values. Furthermore, we propose that these realist representations
exist because of a joint grounding of aesthetic form in physical and cultural
substance. We argue that human perceptual and creative acts play a central role
in shaping these the latent spaces of deep learning systems, but that a realist
basis for aesthetics shows that machines are not mere creative parrots but can
produce novel creative insights from the unique vantage point of scale. Our
findings suggest that human-machine co-creation is not merely possible, but
foundational - with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in both cultural
production and machine perception.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces PHORECAST, a new multimodal dataset for predicting individual and community responses to health messages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personalized and socially aware machine learning by exploring how individuals and communities respond to persuasive public health messaging.

Method: The authors developed PHORECAST, a multimodal dataset designed to enable fine-grained predictions of behavioral and engagement responses to health campaigns.

Result: PHORECAST enables tasks like multimodal understanding, response prediction, personalization, and social forecasting in public health communication.

Conclusion: The dataset aims to advance AI models in their ability to interpret and emulate heterogeneous public sentiment and behavior, fostering adaptive and inclusive health communication.

Abstract: Understanding how diverse individuals and communities respond to persuasive
messaging holds significant potential for advancing personalized and socially
aware machine learning. While Large Vision and Language Models (VLMs) offer
promise, their ability to emulate nuanced, heterogeneous human responses,
particularly in high stakes domains like public health, remains underexplored
due in part to the lack of comprehensive, multimodal dataset. We introduce
PHORECAST (Public Health Outreach REceptivity and CAmpaign Signal Tracking), a
multimodal dataset curated to enable fine-grained prediction of both
individuallevel behavioral responses and community-wide engagement patterns to
health messaging. This dataset supports tasks in multimodal understanding,
response prediction, personalization, and social forecasting, allowing rigorous
evaluation of how well modern AI systems can emulate, interpret, and anticipate
heterogeneous public sentiment and behavior. By providing a new dataset to
enable AI advances for public health, PHORECAST aims to catalyze the
development of models that are not only more socially aware but also aligned
with the goals of adaptive and inclusive health communication

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper presents an IoT-based system and machine learning framework to accurately forecast corrosion of steel structures in heritage sites using minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To proactively preserve culturally significant heritage sites like the San Sebastian Basilica by enabling accurate and cost-effective corrosion monitoring.

Method: Developed an IoT system with LoRa communications to monitor steel corrosion and built a machine learning framework that predicts corrosion rates using temperature and humidity data over three years.

Result: The framework successfully provides real-time corrosion predictions through a Streamlit dashboard with public access and offers preservation recommendations.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable, cost-effective, and proactive preservation of cultural heritage sites globally, without requiring comprehensive sensor networks.

Abstract: Proactive preservation of steel structures at culturally significant heritage
sites like the San Sebastian Basilica in the Philippines requires accurate
corrosion forecasting. This study developed an Internet of Things hardware
system connected with LoRa wireless communications to monitor heritage
buildings with steel structures. From a three year dataset generated by the IoT
system, we built a machine learning framework for predicting atmospheric
corrosion rates using only temperature and relative humidity data. Deployed via
a Streamlit dashboard with ngrok tunneling for public access, the framework
provides real-time corrosion monitoring and actionable preservation
recommendations. This minimal-data approach is scalable and cost effective for
heritage sites with limited monitoring resources, showing that advanced
regression can extract accurate corrosion predictions from basic meteorological
data enabling proactive preservation of culturally significant structures
worldwide without requiring extensive sensor networks

### [413] [AI Generated Child Sexual Abuse Material -- What's the Harm?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02978)
*Caoilte Ó Ciardha,John Buckley,Rebecca S. Portnoff*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper highlights the risks associated with synthetic child sexual abuse material produced by generative AI, arguing that it poses significant threats despite perceived lack of direct victimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the emerging challenges AI-generated CSAM brings to child protection, law enforcement, and societal responses to exploitation.

Method: The paper critically examines AI technologies, evaluates associated harms, and counters claims that AI CSAM might serve as harm reduction.

Result: It identifies risks like revictimization, grooming, normalization of exploitation, and the creation of pathways for offending.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the urgency to address real harms posed by AI CSAM and cautions against views that minimize its risks.

Abstract: The development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of
producing wholly or partially synthetic child sexual abuse material (AI CSAM)
presents profound challenges for child protection, law enforcement, and
societal responses to child exploitation. While some argue that the harmfulness
of AI CSAM differs fundamentally from other CSAM due to a perceived absence of
direct victimization, this perspective fails to account for the range of risks
associated with its production and consumption. AI has been implicated in the
creation of synthetic CSAM of children who have not previously been abused, the
revictimization of known survivors of abuse, the facilitation of grooming,
coercion and sexual extortion, and the normalization of child sexual
exploitation. Additionally, AI CSAM may serve as a new or enhanced pathway into
offending by lowering barriers to engagement, desensitizing users to
progressively extreme content, and undermining protective factors for
individuals with a sexual interest in children. This paper provides a primer on
some key technologies, critically examines the harms associated with AI CSAM,
and cautions against claims that it may function as a harm reduction tool,
emphasizing how some appeals to harmlessness obscure its real risks and may
contribute to inertia in ecosystem responses.
