Abstract: This paper develops an autonomous agentic framework called V-Math that aims
to assist Vietnamese high school students in preparing for the National High
School Graduation Mathematics Exams (NHSGMEs). The salient framework integrates
three specialized AI agents: a specification-matrix-conditioned question
generator, a solver/explainer for detailed step-by-step reasoning, and a
personalized tutor that adapts to student performance. Beyond enabling
self-paced student practice, V-Math supports teachers by generating innovative,
compliant exam questions and building diverse, high-quality question banks.
This reduces manual workload and enriches instructional resources. We describe
the system architecture, focusing on practice modes for learners and
teacher-oriented features for question generation. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate that V-Math produces matrix-aligned exams with high solution
accuracy, delivers coherent explanations, and enhances the variety of practice
materials. These results highlight its potential to support scalable, equitable
mathematics preparation aligned with national standards while also empowering
teachers through AI-assisted exam creation.

### [2] [DISPLIB: a library of train dispatching problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12254)
*Oddvar Kloster,Bj√∏rnar Luteberget,Carlo Mannino,Giorgio Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DISPLIB, a shared framework with industrial data and a common problem definition for train re-routing and re-scheduling, aiming to improve reproducibility and comparisons in research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization-based decision support systems for railways have great potential to reduce delays. However, current research is fragmented, with limited code and data sharing, making reproducibility and comparative assessments difficult.

Method: The authors created DISPLIB, a standardized problem definition and file format, aggregating real-world rail scheduling instances sourced from different use cases. A reference solver implementation is also provided.

Result: DISPLIB provides a shared resource and a unified framework for researchers and developers to improve and evaluate dispatching algorithms, independent of industry-specific applications.

Conclusion: DISPLIB fosters collaboration and empirical comparison in the study of train re-routing and re-scheduling algorithms, enhancing innovation and reproducibility in the field.

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

### [3] [InPhyRe Discovers: Large Multimodal Models Struggle in Inductive Physical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12263)
*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle with inductive physical reasoning when faced with unseen physical environments that violate universal laws, as demonstrated by the novel InPhyRe benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in evaluating inductive physical reasoning in large multimodal models (LMMs) to ensure their reliability, especially in safety-critical contexts.

Method: The authors propose InPhyRe, a visual question-answering benchmark based on synthetic collision videos to evaluate LMMs' ability to adapt their reasoning to environments violating universal physical laws.

Result: Testing 13 LMMs reveals key limitations: difficulties in applying parametric knowledge, poor adaptation to unseen physical laws, and biases favoring language inputs over visual data.

Conclusion: Inductive physical reasoning is currently a weakness for LMMs, highlighting the need for further refinement to improve their ability to adapt to novel physical scenarios and reduce biases.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

### [4] [LLMAP: LLM-Assisted Multi-Objective Route Planning with User Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12273)
*Liangqi Yuan,Dong-Jun Han,Christopher G. Brinton,Sabine Brunswicker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents LLM-Assisted Route Planning (LLMAP), combining natural language understanding by large language models with graph-based algorithms for efficient route planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of direct LLM-based or graph-based route planning approaches by creating a system that can handle complex user objectives and heterogeneous spatio-temporal constraints.

Method: The LLMAP system utilizes an LLM-as-Parser for natural language task parsing and a Multi-Step Graph Search (MSGS) algorithm for solving optimal routes, balancing competing objectives like POI quality and route efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse global locations demonstrate the proposed system's superior performance in meeting multiple constraints related to time, task dependencies, and POI attributes.

Conclusion: The LLMAP system effectively combines the strengths of LLMs and graph-based algorithms, offering a robust solution for constraint-oriented and user-preference-based route planning.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

### [5] [Developing an aeroponic smart experimental greenhouse for controlling irrigation and plant disease detection using deep learning and IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12274)
*Mohammadreza Narimani,Ali Hajiahmad,Ali Moghimi,Reza Alimardani,Shahin Rafiee,Amir Hossein Mirzabe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses a study on developing a smart aeroponic greenhouse integrating IoT and AI to monitor environmental conditions and plant health, achieving promising results in disease detection and environment control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize crop production by enabling efficient environmental control and disease monitoring through integration of advanced technologies like IoT and AI in greenhouses.

Method: An IoT platform was created to monitor environmental conditions, while AI models (VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3) were implemented to detect plant diseases using image analysis. The outcomes were validated against expert evaluations.

Result: The IoT system successfully monitored and adjusted greenhouse conditions in real-time. Among the AI algorithms, the VGG-19 demonstrated the highest accuracy (92%) in detecting plant diseases, specifically drought stress and rust leaves.

Conclusion: The study concludes that combining IoT for environmental monitoring and advanced AI algorithms for disease detection effectively aids greenhouse management and improves decision-making processes for optimized plant growth.

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

### [6] [AIssistant: An Agentic Approach for Human--AI Collaborative Scientific Work on Reviews and Perspectives in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12282)
*Sasi Kiran Gaddipati,Farhana Keya,Gollam Rabby,S√∂ren Auer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIssistant, an open-source Human-AI collaborative framework, simplifies scientific workflows but requires human oversight for accuracy and ethical compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmented, non-human-centred workflows in AI-assisted research processes.

Method: Developed an open-source system integrating modular tools for literature synthesis, citation management, experimentation, and LaTeX paper generation.

Result: AIssistant improves efficiency and thematic consistency in paper drafting. Human collaboration ensures factual accuracy and ethical standards.

Conclusion: AIssistant holds promise but has limitations such as hallucinated citations and challenges with dynamic structures and multimodal content.

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

### [7] [Small Models, Big Results: Achieving Superior Intent Extraction through Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12423)
*Danielle Cohen,Yoni Halpern,Noam Kahlon,Joel Oren,Omri Berkovitch,Sapir Caduri,Ido Dagan,Anatoly Efros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The authors present a novel two-step approach to enhance user intent recognition in resource-constrained models, achieving performance that surpasses large multi-modal language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of accurate user intent recognition in smaller models that run on device, addressing privacy, cost, and latency concerns.

Method: The authors propose a two-step method: structured interaction summarization that captures user actions, followed by intent extraction using a fine-tuned model on aggregated summaries.

Result: Their approach improves user intent understanding in smaller models, even surpassing baseline performance of large MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed technique demonstrates how resource-constrained models can achieve high-quality intent recognition without relying on massive datacenter-based MLLMs.

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

### [8] [Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434)
*Jiahao Yu,Zelei Cheng,Xian Wu,Xinyu Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents \sys, a framework enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex multi-turn software engineering tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on SWE-bench benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with software engineering tasks, requiring multi-turn reasoning and high diversity in outputs, which traditional preference optimization methods fail to fully address.

Method: The authors developed \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework adapting preference optimization algorithms for multi-turn and tool-assisted interactions while preserving policy entropy.

Result: \sys achieved new state-of-the-art results in SWE-bench among open-weight models, with a 30B parameter model outperforming much larger models on certain benchmarks.

Conclusion: \sys enhances performance in complex software engineering LLM tasks by balancing preference alignment and output diversity, showing promise for scaling models in this domain.

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

### [9] [Enhancing Physical Consistency in Lightweight World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12437)
*Dingrui Wang,Zhexiao Sun,Zhouheng Li,Cheng Wang,Youlun Peng,Hongyuan Ye,Baha Zarrouki,Wei Li,Mattia Piccinini,Lei Xie,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents PIWM, a compact model that efficiently captures physical interactions in bird's-eye-view representations, outperforming larger models while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing the trade-off between model size and performance in world models for practical deployment on edge devices.

Method: The authors developed PIWM, incorporating Soft Mask during training and Warm Start for inference to improve dynamic object modeling and prediction.

Result: PIWM (400M) surpasses the baseline by 60.6%, while PIWM (130M Soft Mask) outperforms larger models by 7.4% with 28% faster inference.

Conclusion: Physics-informed modeling techniques can create compact yet highly accurate and efficient world models, enabling practical deployment.

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

### [10] [Reasoning Models Can be Accurately Pruned Via Chain-of-Thought Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12464)
*Ryan Lucas,Kayhan Behdin,Zhipeng Wang,Qingquan Song,Shao Tang,Rahul Mazumder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Reasoning-Aware Compression" (RAC), a method to improve neural network pruning for reasoning language models, addressing problems in current approaches that degrade model performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the computational cost of deploying reasoning language models at scale, as current models generate extensive chain-of-thought traces during inference that are expensive and inefficient.

Method: The proposed RAC method reconstructs activations both from standard input and model-generated chain-of-thought traces during pruning, enhancing reasoning performance. It is a straightforward adaptation to existing pruning techniques like SparseGPT.

Result: The RAC method significantly improves the performance of pruned reasoning language models and seamlessly integrates into established workflows.

Conclusion: Reasoning-Aware Compression offers a practical solution to optimize reasoning language models for more efficient and effective deployment.

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the
paper can be found at: https://github.com/RyanLucas3/RAC

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PowerGPT, an AI system that simplifies clinical trial design tasks like test selection and sample size estimation, showing improved accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trial design often requires detailed statistical knowledge, posing barriers for many researchers. The paper aims to simplify and automate these processes with AI integration.

Method: PowerGPT combines large language models with statistical engines to automate statistical test selection and sample size estimation, tested through a randomized trial for its effectiveness.

Result: PowerGPT demonstrated higher task completion and accuracy rates compared to traditional methods, while significantly reducing the time required for trial design processes.

Conclusion: PowerGPT provides a scalable, user-friendly AI solution that addresses expertise gaps and enhances accessibility, reliability, and efficiency in clinical research trial design.

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

TL;DR: The paper connects computational complexity concepts from the Soma Cube puzzle to cognitive problem-solving strategies, identifying mechanisms that reduce task difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand and explain the mechanisms of intelligence by mapping computational complexity concepts to human cognitive strategies.

Method: Analyzed the Soma Cube puzzle's complexity and systematically refined a trial-and-error search by introducing cognitive strategies like chunking, sorting, scaffolding, and inference.

Result: Showed how these strategies reduce task complexity, leveraging physical constraints to improve problem-solving efficiency.

Conclusion: Proposes a model of intelligence as a combination of algorithms that use both cognitive processes and physical tools to reduce task difficulty.

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

### [13] [A Dimensionality-Reduced XAI Framework for Roundabout Crash Severity Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12524)
*Rohit Chakraborty,Subasish Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates crash patterns in Ohio roundabouts to understand severe crash drivers, utilizing an explainable AI workflow that blends Cluster Correspondence Analysis and SHAP-based severity modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Roundabouts improve safety, but crash risk and severity vary under different conditions, prompting a need for targeted insights for improved countermeasure design and reporting.

Method: The study uses a two-step workflow: Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to find factor associations and tree-based severity modeling interpreted with SHAP to quantify impact on injury severity.

Result: Findings highlight that crashes involving darkness, wet surfaces, and high speeds lead to higher severity, while specific mechanisms at entries, circulation lanes, and slow-down zones contribute to pattern-specific crash types.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a robust process connecting roundabout crash pattern discovery to case-specific explanations, offering actionable insights for public safety analytics and countermeasure development.

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

Abstract: We introduce a novel training methodology named zELO, which optimizes
retrieval performance via the analysis that ranking tasks are statically
equivalent to a Thurstone model. Based on the zELO method, we use unsupervised
data in order train a suite of state-of-the-art open-weight reranker models:
zerank-1 and zerank-1-small. These models achieve the highest retrieval scores
in multiple domains, including finance, legal, code, and STEM, outperforming
closed-source proprietary rerankers on both NDCG@10 and Recall. These models
also demonstrate great versatility, maintaining their 0-shot performance on
out-of-domain and private customer datasets. The training data included 112,000
queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from
unannotated queries and documents in less than 10,000 H100-hours.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic AI, which enhances customer support by enabling proactive support and dynamic context adaptation using an AI co-pilot, Minerva CQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI tools in customer service do not adequately address key challenges such as high average handling time, poor customer satisfaction, and low first-call resolution due to limited contextual reasoning and reactive approaches.

Method: The proposed Agentic AI uses technologies such as real-time transcription, intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval, and dynamic customer profiling. It proactively triggers modular workflows while maintaining dynamic conversational contexts.

Result: The implementation of Minerva CQ, utilizing Agentic AI, has shown significant improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience during live deployments.

Conclusion: Agentic AI helps overcome inefficiencies in customer service by proactively supporting agents and enhancing the customer experience using advanced contextual and modular workflows.

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple
deployments.

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes DaSAThco, a framework leveraging Large Language Models to improve SAT solver performance by generalizing heuristic selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The heterogeneity of SAT problems makes it impossible to develop a universally optimal solver configuration, and existing dataset-specific approaches lack generalizability.

Method: DaSAThco uses a Large Language Model informed by Problem Archetypes to generate heuristic ensembles. It learns an adaptive selection mechanism to map features to heuristics.

Result: Experiments show DaSAThco outperforms current methods and generalizes effectively to new, out-of-domain problem types.

Conclusion: DaSAThco enables a scalable and practical method for automated algorithm design, offering robust generalization across varied SAT problem types.

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

*Anmol Singhal Navya Singhal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AD-FCoT, a prompting framework for financial news sentiment analysis that enhances reliability and interpretability by combining analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of interpreting financial news sentiments, existing methods struggle with capturing economic context and lack reasoning transparency, making their reliability questionable.

Method: AD-FCoT is a prompting framework that uses analogical reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to draw comparisons between new financial events and historical scenarios, guiding LLMs to produce structured and interpretable reasoning.

Result: AD-FCoT outperforms strong baseline methods in sentiment classification accuracy and shows stronger correlation with market returns. It also provides domain-aligned, interpretable explanations for practical financial analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances model reliability, interpretability, and performance in financial sentiment analysis by leveraging the LLM's internal knowledge without requiring additional fine-tuning or data.

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

TL;DR: GBV-SQL introduces a framework using SQL-to-text back-translation for semantic validation in Text2SQL tasks, revealing flaws in existing benchmarks and improving accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic misalignment in Text2SQL tasks and highlight systematic issues with benchmark quality.

Method: Propose a multi-agent framework, GBV-SQL, utilizing SQL-to-text back-translation to verify query alignment and analyze flaws in ground-truth benchmarks.

Result: GBV-SQL achieves notable execution accuracy improvements on the BIRD and Spider benchmarks, especially after addressing flawed examples.

Conclusion: The framework enhances semantic validation in Text2SQL and stresses the importance of refining benchmark datasets for more accurate model evaluation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a Random Forest (RF) model to forecast monthly weight gain of herd-based cattle, outperforming SVR and LSTM models with an R¬≤ of 0.973.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictions of cattle weight gain to aid farmers in refining feeding strategies, making breeding choices, and mitigating risks due to climate variability and market fluctuations.

Method: This study employs a Random Forest (RF) model and compares it to SVR and LSTM using datasets of 756 cattle samples, integrating weather and age data.

Result: The RF model achieved the highest performance with R¬≤ = 0.973, RMSE = 0.040, and MAE = 0.033, demonstrating superior accuracy over SVR and LSTM, particularly when considering weather and age factors.

Conclusion: The RF model is a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight gain, and the study provides a publicly available automated pre-processing tool for dataset preparation in future research.

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe introduces a new universal encoding method for ECG signals compatible with LLMs, enhancing interpretability, transferability, and addressing time-scale challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in employing LLMs for ECG analysis include poor transferability across LLMs, difficulty in capturing time-scale information, and lack of interpretability, limiting clinical adoption.

Method: The authors developed ECG-aBcDe, an encoding method that turns ECG signals into a universal language for LLMs. It involves constructing a hybrid dataset, enabling direct fine-tuning of LLMs and extracting attention heatmaps for interpretability.

Result: ECG-aBcDe demonstrated competitive results on metrics like ROUGE-L and METEOR, while achieving remarkable improvements in BLEU-4 with scores of 42.58 and 30.76 in in-dataset and cross-dataset scenarios.

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe offers a paradigm shift in integrating ECG analysis with LLMs, enhancing performance and clinical feasibility through better interpretability and transferability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

*Beidan Liu,Zhengqiu Zhu,Chen Gao,Yong Zhao,Wei Qi,Quanjun Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoCO, an automated solution for nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems (NCOPs), combining structured reasoning by LLMs with advanced heuristic methods to tackle constraint interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for solving NCOPs rely on iterative human-driven processes and lack scalable automation. Recent LLM-based methods are limited in handling sophisticated constraint interactions.

Method: AutoCO leverages structured reasoning using LLMs for strategy generation, pairing computational principles like Evolutionary Algorithms and Monte Carlo Tree Search to balance local refinement and global exploration.

Result: Experiments demonstrate AutoCO's effectiveness and superior performance in comparison to baseline methods on three NCOP benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoCO offers a transformative, scalable, and automated approach to solving complex NCOPs, outperforming existing methods through its innovative coevolution mechanism.

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

TL;DR: The study examines reasoning advances in large language models (LLMs) over 18 months, highlighting improvements from hidden Chain of Thought prompting and neuro-symbolic architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLM reasoning improvements and reducing computational costs in problem-solving.

Method: Longitudinal study on reasoning accuracy over 18 months, neuro-symbolic architecture combining LLM translation of problems and SMT solver for efficient computation.

Result: Performance improved significantly from 2023 through 2025 using advanced reasoning techniques; neuro-symbolic methods achieved high accuracy at reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: Integrating reasoning strategies and neuro-symbolic methods boosts LLM efficiency and accuracy, promising for scalable, cost-effective solutions.

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

TL;DR: GRRAF is a training-free methodology that uses large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for graph reasoning, achieving high accuracy and scalability while avoiding finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph reasoning methods require substantial finetuning or rely on predetermined algorithms, highlighting the need for a flexible, scalable approach that leverages modern LLM capabilities.

Method: GRRAF integrates LLMs with a graph database to execute code queries, allows retrieval-augmented generation, and uses an error feedback loop with a time-out to ensure accurate and efficient reasoning.

Result: Experimental results showed GRRAF achieving 100% accuracy in tasks like cycle detection and shortest path computation, while maintaining low token cost and scaling effectively with graph sizes.

Conclusion: GRRAF demonstrates a robust, scalable alternative to traditional graph reasoning methods, offering both high accuracy and operational efficiency across varied graph tasks.

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

*Shicheng Ye,Chao Yu,Kaiqiang Ke,Chengdong Xu,Yinqi Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical memory architecture for language model-based agents, enabling finer knowledge transfer and improved task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task approaches inefficently transfer knowledge by treating prior experiences as monolithic, which limits adaptability.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical memory structure with high-level planning and low-level execution memories, refined using a mechanism called Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H$^2$R).

Result: Hierarchical memory architecture enhances task-relevant knowledge retrieval, outperforming baselines like Expel in decision-making and generalization.

Conclusion: Hierarchical decoupling of memories refines knowledge transfer efficiency, suggesting a promising approach for LLM-based multi-task systems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LTA-Thinker, a framework to improve reasoning in large language models by enhancing the variance and optimization of latent thought distributions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in efficiently generating and utilizing high-quality Latent Thought in language models to enhance complex reasoning and mitigate overthinking.

Method: The authors propose LTA-Thinker, which combines (1) a learnable prior-based architecture to enhance the variance of Latent Thought distributions and (2) a distribution-based directional optimization paradigm with novel Semantic Alignment Loss and Reasoning Focus Loss.

Result: LTA-Thinker demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, better scaling effects, and a higher performance ceiling in reasoning tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves reasoning performance and computational efficiency by optimizing Latent Thought distributions through new architectural and training innovations.

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and replicable AI-driven solution for municipalities to optimize resource management and urban governance in rapidly urbanizing areas, overcoming the drawbacks of conventional census-based methods.

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven
geospatial analytics in enhancing data-driven urban governance.

*Xingxing Hong,Yungong Wang,Dexin Jin,Ye Yuan,Ximing Huang,Zijian Wu,Wenxin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introducing HLSMAC, a benchmark aimed at evaluating high-level strategic intelligence in MARL using StarCraft II scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL benchmarks mainly assess micromanagement, lacking tools to evaluate high-level strategic intelligence.

Method: Developed 12 StarCraft II scenarios inspired by classical stratagems, alongside new metrics for measuring diverse strategic elements.

Result: Experiments show that HLSMAC effectively evaluates advanced strategic decision-making in MARL algorithms and agents.

Conclusion: HLSMAC is a robust platform, enabling advancements in high-level strategic intelligence assessment for MARL algorithms.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

### [31] [The Anatomy of Alignment: Decomposing Preference Optimization by Steering Sparse Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12934)
*Jeremias Ferrao,Matthijs van der Lende,Ilija Lichkovski,Clement Neo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature Steering with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a framework for transparent model alignment that trains an adapter to use interpretable features, providing effective preference optimization and mechanistic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment approaches like RLHF create opaque changes in model parameters, making it hard to understand what the model has learned.

Method: FSRL uses a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract interpretable features, and trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating these features during reinforcement learning.

Result: FSRL achieved comparable effectiveness to RLHF in preference optimization and revealed through analysis that stylistic features are often prioritized over explicit alignment concepts.

Conclusion: FSRL offers a method for interpretable model control and facilitates deeper understanding of alignment processes in language models.

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

*Shilian Chen,Jie Zhou,Tianyu Huai,Yujiang Lu,Junsong Li,Bihao Zhan,Qianjun Pan,Yutao Yang,Xin Li,Qin Chen,Hang Yan,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces Evo-Merging, a method for merging large language models using inference-time queries rather than model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of merging massive large language models without accessing their parameters, especially relevant for API-only black-box services such as GPT-4.

Method: A derivative-free optimization framework based on evolutionary algorithms is utilized, incorporating sparsity-based denoising to filter redundant information and sign-aware scaling to compute optimized combinations of models.

Result: The proposed Evo-Merging method achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and outperformed existing baselines in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: Evo-Merging is an effective framework for black-box model merging, providing a practical solution for integrating large language models solely accessible via API interfaces.

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

### [33] [Forget What's Sensitive, Remember What Matters: Token-Level Differential Privacy in Memory Sculpting for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12958)
*Bihao Zhan,Jie Zhou,Junsong Li,Yutao Yang,Shilian Chen,Qianjun Pan,Xin Li,Wen Wu,Xingjiao Wu,Qin Chen,Hang Yan,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Continual Learning models encounter privacy challenges in sequential knowledge acquisition, and traditional methods sacrificing model utility. This paper presents PeCL, a framework with dynamic Differential Privacy allocation and privacy-guided memory sculpting for better privacy and utility balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in Continual Learning without significantly degrading model utility, especially in applications involving sensitive data.

Method: PeCL introduces a dynamic Differential Privacy mechanism for token-level sensitivity-based budget allocation and a memory sculpting module to intelligently forget sensitive info while preserving critical knowledge.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PeCL minimizes catastrophic forgetting while offering robust privacy protections, outperforming baseline models in accuracy and privacy balance.

Conclusion: PeCL is effective for privacy-enhanced continual learning, striking a balance between protecting sensitive data and retaining task-relevant knowledge with high accuracy.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

*Yarin Benyamin,Argaman Mordoch,Shahaf S. Shperberg,Roni Stern*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Planning Copilot, a chatbot integrating planning tools with LLMs via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), improving their long-horizon planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-horizon planning, which limits their ability to efficiently operate as autonomous agents.

Method: The paper proposes the Planning Copilot, which connects LLMs with external planning tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and facilitates natural language-based tool interaction.

Result: Empirical tests show the Planning Copilot outperformed using native LLMs for planning and surpassed GPT-5 in performance despite relying on smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating dedicated planning tools via protocols like MCP enhances LLM performance in complex planning tasks without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

*Shinichi Honna,Taichi Murayama,Akira Matsui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Anna Karenina Principle (AKP), reverse AKP, and other structural patterns across mediums, revealing varied dependencies of success and failure on structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from understanding how success and failure are structurally influenced in different mediums (novels, research papers, movies, etc.), using the AKP as a framework.

Method: Functional blocks represent texts, assessed for structural convergence in transition order and position across various mediums.

Result: Structural principles differ by medium: Novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia exhibits both AKP and ordered patterns, academic papers align with reverse AKP but display noise, and movies show genre-based divergence.

Conclusion: Success is contingent on medium-specific structural constraints, while failure manifests diversely across domains.

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

TL;DR: MiniAgentPro is a visualization platform that facilitates the simulation of agent societies and tests their performance in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for simulating agent societies lack systematic evaluations and physically grounded visual environments.

Method: Developed MiniAgentPro, featuring a map editor and simulation player, and introduced a test set with eight event scenarios to evaluate agent abilities.

Result: GPT-4o performs well in basic scenarios but faces challenges in harder, more complex event variants.

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro provides a valuable tool for evaluating and advancing the capabilities of language-model-based agents in realistic settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic
evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with
physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces
and interact with items realistically. We develop MiniAgentPro, a visualization
platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a
simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a
comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and
hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate
strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in
hard variants.

*Marylou Fauchard,Florian Carichon,Margarida Carvalho,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a benchmark to test large language models (LLMs) on the College Admission Problem, revealing challenges in achieving consistent performance across feasibility, stability, and optimality criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to explore how LLMs handle matching problems involving preferences and constraints since their abilities in other complex reasoning tasks have been tested but not adequately for these problems.

Method: The authors introduced a benchmark of 369 College Admission Problem instances and evaluated several LLMs using techniques like Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning, while incorporating diverse prompting strategies.

Result: LLMs demonstrated inconsistent performance across benchmarks, with reasoning-oriented models like QwQ and GPT-oss outperforming traditional LLMs. Different prompting strategies varied in success, and iterative feedback did not guarantee monotonic improvements.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential in combinatorial optimization with preferential constraints but require improvements in reasoning stability and prompting strategies for consistent outcomes.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

TL;DR: The paper discusses an AI system tailored for financial crime compliance (FCC) in fintech, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and alignment with regulatory expectations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising cost and complexity of FCC, coupled with ineffective solutions, motivate the need for transparent, efficient AI applications in compliance systems.

Method: The researchers employed an Action Design Research (ADR) process to build an agentic AI system in collaboration with a fintech firm and regulatory stakeholders. The system focuses on artifact-centric modeling to allocate roles to autonomous agents and ensure compliance through audit logging.

Result: The study provides a developed reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and insights showcasing how AI can enhance FCC workflows while adhering to regulatory requirements.

Conclusion: Agentic AI systems can effectively support FCC by combining automation with governance structures, fostering transparency and trust in highly regulated domains.

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

### [39] [G-CSEA: A Graph-Based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm for Identifying Infeasibility in Pseudo-Boolean Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13203)
*Kanishk Garg,Saranya D.,Sanal Kumar,Saurabh Singh,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses workforce scheduling issues by proposing a new method, G-CSEA, to extract conflict sets for resolving scheduling infeasibilities using a graph-based approach inspired by SAT solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workforce scheduling often faces challenges due to conflicting rule-based constraints that render scheduling models infeasible. Identifying the source of these conflicts is essential for restoring feasibility and resolving scheduling issues.

Method: The proposed method, G-CSEA, uses a graph-based approach inspired by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. It constructs an implication graph during constraint propagation and traces contributing constraints upon detecting conflicts to extract a conflict set.

Result: The algorithm successfully identifies conflict sets in pseudo-Boolean constraint models, which can be minimized using QuickXplain for further refinement.

Conclusion: The proposed G-CSEA algorithm offers an efficient and novel technique for diagnosing infeasibilities in rule-based scheduling models, outperforming traditional methods reliant on excessive feasibility checks.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

*Nadim Barakat,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection and their effectiveness in simulating clinical AI assistance with varying output formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy, a major cause of blindness, requires effective screening tools. Current AI systems offer minimal binary outputs that may reduce clinical trust. The study aims to explore better output formats to improve clinician-AI collaboration.

Method: The study evaluated two models, MedGemma and GPT-4o, across three setups: baseline performance evaluation, simulated AI assistance using synthetic predictions, and actual AI collaboration where GPT-4o integrated MedGemma outputs for DR detection.

Result: MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline with higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o had high specificity but low sensitivity. When using simulated inputs, GPT-4o struggled with incorrect data whereas MedGemma was stable. Guided by MedGemma's outputs in collaboration, GPT-4o reached AUROC up to 0.96.

Conclusion: MLLMs show potential in enhancing DR screening pipelines and simulating clinical AI workflows. MedGemma's lightweight and open-source nature provides accessibility in low-resource settings, while descriptive outputs improve clinician trust and workflow explainability.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like limited adaptability and multimodal integration in current AI memory architectures, which hinder the progress toward AGI.

Method: The authors use a scenario-driven methodology to derive functional requirements and formulate design principles, leading to the development of COLMA‚Äîa cognitive layered memory architecture.

Result: COLMA integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms, offering a framework for AI systems that can learn continuously and reason like humans.

Conclusion: COLMA provides a structured pathway for reinforcing AI systems with human-like memory capabilities, advancing the practical development of AGI.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

### [42] [RepIt: Representing Isolated Targets to Steer Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13281)
*Vincent Siu,Nathan W. Henry,Nicholas Crispino,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RepIt, a framework for isolating concept-specific representations in large language models (LLMs) to enable targeted interventions without broader effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of broader effects in activation steering in LLMs and equip models with a method for isolating pure concept vectors for targeted interventions.

Method: RepIt is developed to isolate concept-specific representations using a data-efficient approach, capable of extracting robust concept vectors from a small number of examples and localizing interventions to specific neurons.

Result: RepIt demonstrates precise interventions across five LLMs, suppressing refusal for targeted concepts while preserving refusal behavior on non-targeted concepts. The corrective signal is localized to 100-200 neurons.

Conclusion: RepIt enables granular control of LLM behaviors, overcoming overgeneralization issues while enabling efficient interventions that can be scaled to underrepresented topics, but raises concerns about potential misuse in evading benchmarks.

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

TL;DR: "Shapes of cognition" framework simplifies cognitive modeling for Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs) by mimicking human strategies like pattern recognition and reasoning by analogy while addressing atypical situations with recovery methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a computational framework enabling agents to navigate complex real-life scenarios using human-like cognitive strategies to reduce cognitive load, enhance adaptability, and provide actionable insights.

Method: Utilizes "shapes"‚Äîintegrating sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and procedural knowledge‚Äîwithin a specific cognitive architecture to simulate typical behaviors and manage atypical situations in practical applications.

Result: Shapes-based modeling demonstrates the feasibility of building explainable, extensible agent systems that are adaptable and trustworthy across diverse domains, while revitalizing knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

Conclusion: The "shapes" paradigm for computational modeling in LEIAs provides both theoretical and practical advancements in creating effective and trustworthy intelligent systems applicable beyond the initial domain.

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

TL;DR: The paper presents Taurus, a hardware accelerator for privacy-preserving computations using multi-bit TFHE, achieving significant performance improvements and demonstrating its capability with models like GPT-2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure processing of encrypted data in cloud environments is limited by the computational complexity of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes, particularly in achieving efficient and versatile computation.

Method: The authors developed Taurus, a hardware accelerator that leverages novel FFT units, key reuse strategies, and a compiler with operation deduplication to enhance multi-bit TFHE computations.

Result: Taurus supports up to 10-bit ciphertexts and achieves up to 2600x speedup over CPUs, 1200x speedup over GPUs, and up to 7x faster performance compared to existing accelerators. It facilitates privacy-preserving inference with large models like GPT-2.

Conclusion: Taurus represents a significant step in addressing numeric representation constraints in multi-bit TFHE, enabling practical applications of privacy-preserving computation in the cloud.

Abstract: In the era of cloud computing, privacy-preserving computation offloading is
crucial for safeguarding sensitive data. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
enables secure processing of encrypted data, but the inherent computational
complexity of FHE operations introduces significant computational overhead on
the server side. FHE schemes often face a tradeoff between efficiency and
versatility. While the CKKS scheme is highly efficient for polynomial
operations, it lacks the flexibility of the binary TFHE (Torus-FHE) scheme,
which offers greater versatility but at the cost of efficiency. The recent
multi-bit TFHE extension offers greater flexibility and performance by
supporting native non-polynomial operations and efficient integer processing.
However, current implementations of multi-bit TFHE are constrained by its
narrower numeric representation, which prevents its adoption in applications
requiring wider numeric representations.
  To address this challenge, we introduce Taurus, a hardware accelerator
designed to enhance the efficiency of multi-bit TFHE computations. Taurus
supports ciphertexts up to 10 bits by leveraging novel FFT units and optimizing
memory bandwidth through key reuse strategies. We also propose a compiler with
operation deduplication to improve memory utilization. Our experiment results
demonstrate that Taurus achieves up to 2600x speedup over a CPU, 1200x speedup
over a GPU, and up to 7x faster compared to the previous state-of-the-art TFHE
accelerator. Moreover, Taurus is the first accelerator to demonstrate
privacy-preserving inference with large language models such as GPT-2. These
advancements enable more practical and scalable applications of
privacy-preserving computation in cloud environments.

*Cenlin Duan,Jianlei Yang,Rubing Yang,Yikun Wang,Yiou Wang,Lingkun Long,Yingjie Qi,Xiaolin He,Ao Zhou,Xueyan Wang,Weisheng Zhao*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: HPIM, a memory-centric heterogeneous Processing-In-Memory accelerator, overcomes limitations of traditional GPUs in large language model inference by strategically combining SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems, offering up to 22.8x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies in memory-bound workloads during LLM inference, where GPUs face resource underutilization and bandwidth bottlenecks.

Method: HPIM integrates SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems using a co-designed architecture that intelligently assigns tasks based on workload characteristics and parallelization.

Result: Achieved up to 22.8x speedup compared to NVIDIA A100 GPU and outperformed other PIM-based accelerators in evaluations.

Conclusion: HPIM demonstrates high scalability and practicality as a solution to accelerate LLM inference, making it optimal for memory-intensive tasks.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) presents significant
challenges due to their enormous memory footprints, low arithmetic intensity,
and stringent latency requirements, particularly during the autoregressive
decoding stage. Traditional compute-centric accelerators, such as GPUs, suffer
from severe resource underutilization and memory bandwidth bottlenecks in these
memory-bound workloads. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose
HPIM, the first memory-centric heterogeneous Processing-In-Memory (PIM)
accelerator that integrates SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems designed
specifically for LLM inference. HPIM employs a software-hardware co-design
approach that combines a specialized compiler framework with a heterogeneous
hardware architecture. It intelligently partitions workloads based on their
characteristics: latency-critical attention operations are mapped to the
SRAM-PIM subsystem to exploit its ultra-low latency and high computational
flexibility, while weight-intensive GEMV computations are assigned to the
HBM-PIM subsystem to leverage its high internal bandwidth and large storage
capacity. Furthermore, HPIM introduces a tightly coupled pipeline strategy
across SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems to maximize intra-token parallelism,
thereby significantly mitigating serial dependency of the autoregressive
decoding stage. Comprehensive evaluations using a cycle-accurate simulator
demonstrate that HPIM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art accelerators,
achieving a peak speedup of up to 22.8x compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU.
Moreover, HPIM exhibits superior performance over contemporary PIM-based
accelerators, highlighting its potential as a highly practical and scalable
solution for accelerating large-scale LLM inference.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Orthrus, an automated dual-loop framework for system-technology co-optimization (STCO) to bridge system requirements and technology innovations, achieving significant improvement in delay and power efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient system-technology co-optimization methodologies to tackle the information gap across design hierarchies and effectively explore the cross-layer design space.

Method: A dual-loop automated framework called Orthrus is introduced, using system-level insights to prioritize standard cells and Pareto-efficient Bayesian optimization, combined with a neural network-assisted differential evolution algorithm for technology parameters.

Result: Experiments on 7nm technology reveal that Orthrus achieves 12.5% delay reduction at iso-power and 61.4% power savings at iso-delay over baseline methods.

Conclusion: Orthrus successfully bridges system and technology optimizations, significantly advancing efficiency and establishing new Pareto frontiers in the VLSI industry.

Abstract: With the diminishing return from Moore's Law, system-technology
co-optimization (STCO) has emerged as a promising approach to sustain the
scaling trends in the VLSI industry. By bridging the gap between system
requirements and technology innovations, STCO enables customized optimizations
for application-driven system architectures. However, existing research lacks
sufficient discussion on efficient STCO methodologies, particularly in
addressing the information gap across design hierarchies and navigating the
expansive cross-layer design space. To address these challenges, this paper
presents Orthrus, a dual-loop automated framework that synergizes system-level
and technology-level optimizations. At the system level, Orthrus employs a
novel mechanism to prioritize the optimization of critical standard cells using
system-level statistics. It also guides technology-level optimization via the
normal directions of the Pareto frontier efficiently explored by Bayesian
optimization. At the technology level, Orthrus leverages system-aware insights
to optimize standard cell libraries. It employs a neural network-assisted
enhanced differential evolution algorithm to efficiently optimize technology
parameters. Experimental results on 7nm technology demonstrate that Orthrus
achieves 12.5% delay reduction at iso-power and 61.4% power savings at
iso-delay over the baseline approaches, establishing new Pareto frontiers in
STCO.

*Nikolay Banar,Ehsan Lotfi,Jens Van Nooten,Cristina Arhiliuc,Marija Kliocaite,Walter Daelemans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the underrepresentation of the Dutch language in embedding resources by introducing new evaluation and generation tools specifically for Dutch embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dutch remains underrepresented in multilingual embedding resources; the authors aim to address this gap.

Method: They created the MTEB-NL benchmark with diverse Dutch datasets, developed a training dataset (using both existing and synthetic data), and released E5-NL embedding models.

Result: The E5-NL models showed strong performance across various tasks, and the resources are publicly available.

Conclusion: The work significantly enriches resources for Dutch embedding development, encouraging broader adoption and advancement.

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

### [48] [MORABLES: A Benchmark for Assessing Abstract Moral Reasoning in LLMs with Fables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12371)
*Matteo Marcuzzo,Alessandro Zangari,Andrea Albarelli,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORABLES introduces a benchmark to test LLMs on moral reasoning using fables and adversarial cases, revealing their dependence on patterns over true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to transition from evaluating LLMs on standard comprehension to complex moral reasoning, leveraging literature to evaluate deeper comprehension skills.

Method: They developed a benchmark (MORABLES) with multiple-choice questions focused on moral inference, including adversarial tests targeting vulnerabilities and shortcuts in LLMs.

Result: Findings reveal that larger LLMs perform better than smaller ones but remain susceptible to adversarial strategies, relying on patterns rather than genuine moral reasoning; reasoning-enhanced models show no real improvement.

Conclusion: LLMs' performance in moral reasoning tasks is driven more by their scale than by their reasoning capabilities, exhibiting brittleness through contradictions and limitations in true moral comprehension.

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

*Anu Pradhan,Alexandra Ortan,Apurv Verma,Madhavan Seshadri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in legal contexts, emphasizing robust metrics for reliability and statistically sound comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics fail to capture the nuanced quality dimensions of recommendation systems, particularly in specialized, high-stakes areas like legal research, creating a need for a more reliable and scalable evaluation approach.

Method: The study investigates inter-rater reliability metrics for alignment between LLM and human evaluations, testing various metrics like Krippendorff's alpha, Gwet's AC2, and rank correlation coefficients, and employs the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections for statistical comparison.

Result: The research identifies limitations in traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha and highlights Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation coefficients as robust alternatives. Statistical comparisons are improved using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with adjustments for multiple comparisons.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables scalable and cost-effective evaluation of RAG systems, maintaining the precision required in legal applications and alleviating the human-intensive evaluation bottleneck.

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

*Mitchell Plyler,Yilun Zhang,Alexander Tuzhilin,Saoud Khalifah,Sen Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SENTRA, a Transformer-based method for detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs), particularly in out-of-domain settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing capabilities and applications of LLMs, the possibility of their misuse grows. Detecting text generated by LLMs that is not labeled as such is a crucial task to address this issue.

Method: The authors propose SENTRA, a Transformer-based encoder model. It uses selected-next-token probability sequences and employs contrastive pre-training on large datasets without labels.

Result: SENTRA was tested on three public datasets across 24 text domains and outperformed baselines, particularly when applied to out-of-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: SENTRA is an effective, general-purpose tool for detecting LLM-generated text, offering superior performance over existing methods in the detection of out-of-domain content.

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

*Wen-wai Yim,Asma Ben Abacha,Zixuan Yu,Robert Doerning,Fei Xia,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MORQA, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain and highlights the performance of LLM-based evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automatic evaluation metrics inadequately assess NLG systems' performance in the medical domain, particularly for open-ended, multilingual question answering tasks.

Method: The authors developed the MORQA benchmark featuring English and Chinese medical QA datasets with multiple gold-standard answers and expert human ratings. Then, they compared traditional metrics with LLM-based evaluators, like GPT-4 and Gemini.

Result: LLM-based evaluation approaches significantly outperformed traditional metrics in aligning with expert judgments, showing sensitivity to semantic details and robustness to reference variability.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for human-aligned methods for NLG evaluation in critical domains like medicine and publicly releases datasets to promote further research.

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedFact is a benchmark for Chinese medical fact-checking, assessing the capabilities of 20 leading LLMs in verifying and locating errors in medical texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for rigorous evaluation of LLMs in healthcare to ensure factual reliability due to the complexity of real-world medical information.

Method: MedFact consists of 2,116 expert-annotated instances from diverse medical texts, constructed using a hybrid AI-human framework with iterative expert feedback.

Result: LLMs can identify errors but struggle with precise error localization. Advanced reasoning techniques often lead to misidentifying correct information as erroneous.

Conclusion: MedFact emphasizes the challenges faced by LLMs in medical applications and aims to steer development towards models with better factual reliability and medical awareness.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopicK, a method to enhance in-context learning by selecting demonstration examples that comprehensively cover relevant knowledge topics for a given input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for in-context learning often fail to select optimal demonstrations due to reliance on embedding similarity or generation probability, which can lead to irrelevant or redundant examples.

Method: The proposed TopicK framework identifies and covers fine-grained topic-level knowledge needed for inputs by estimating required topics and assessing the model's topical knowledge. It iteratively selects demonstrations to address gaps in topical knowledge.

Result: Experiments using various datasets and both open- and closed-source large language models (LLMs) validate the effectiveness of TopicK.

Conclusion: TopicK is an effective methodology for improving in-context learning through a more targeted and comprehensive selection of relevant demonstrations.

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models (LMs) struggle with aspects like tense, negation, voice, and modality. This study evaluated SOTA models using a dataset (LUCID) and metrics like HCE accuracy, finding Compound-Beta to be the most balanced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure modern language models can effectively align with human linguistic interpretation, especially in the context of educational technologies and SDG 4.

Method: The study introduced the LUCID dataset consisting of sentence pairs in English and Bengali and assessed SOTA models using metrics including Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Mean Absolute Error, and HCE accuracy.

Result: Compound-Beta achieved the highest Pearson correlation in English and exhibited robust performance on mixed-language data, demonstrating superior alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: The study underscores the linguistic challenges in language models and identifies Compound-Beta as the most balanced model, emphasizing its potential for applications requiring precise human-like linguistic comprehension.

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to refine and align reasoning traces from LLMs to train task-specific reasoning models, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training small task-specific reasoning models is difficult when high-quality labels or human supervision are limited, while LLMs can provide abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can be leveraged for supervision.

Method: The proposed R2tA method involves generating reasoning traces with an open-source base model, refining them to eliminate inconsistencies, and performing two-stage alignment‚Äîsupervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization‚Äîto train reasoning models.

Result: R2tA demonstrates effectiveness in evaluating extended entity relationship diagrams (EERDs) for database system design, with a curated dataset of 600 variants showing increased accuracy while addressing hallucinations and errors.

Conclusion: R2tA is a practical and cost-effective technique for adapting LLMs to structurally complex and data-scarce tasks, offering scalable solutions for education and other domains.

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

Conclusion: FunAudio-ASR demonstrates its practical robustness and effectiveness by balancing cutting-edge performance with real-world optimization, making it suitable for deployment in complex ASR applications.

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines three approaches to train transformer-based models for French-to-Bambara translation in low-resource settings, finding that simpler architectures perform better overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of translating French to Bambara, a low-resource African language, using neural networks.

Method: The paper explores three pipelines: a simple transformer model, fine-tuned LLaMA3 instructor models, and language distillation using a LaBSE-based dual neural network.

Result: The simple transformer pipeline outperformed more complex approaches, achieving 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF accuracy on custom datasets like Yiri.

Conclusion: Simpler transformer architectures are more effective in low-resource language translation, highlighting challenges with dataset-specific patterns in advanced models.

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

*Vijay Govindarajan,Pratik Patel,Sahil Tripathi,Md Azizul Hoque,Gautam Siddharth Kashyap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-shot Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) system using pre-trained models to improve caption quality without extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AAC systems face data limitations compared to image captioning, necessitating novel methods to improve caption quality.

Method: The system employs pre-trained audio CLIP models for feature extraction and a large language model (LLM) guided by structured prompts. MAGIC search refines audio-caption alignment.

Result: The approach achieved a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) and showed significant reliance on robust audio-text matching and keyword selection.

Conclusion: Zero-shot AAC with pre-trained models and optimized keyword prompts offers a promising direction for overcoming AAC data challenges, though performance relies heavily on matching quality and prompt design.

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

### [59] [EconProver: Towards More Economical Test-Time Scaling for Automated Theorem Proving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12603)
*Mukai Li,Linfeng Song,Zhenwen Liang,Jiahao Xu,Shansan Gong,Qi Liu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the efficiency of test-time scaling strategies in Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) using Large Language Models. It introduces the EconRL pipeline to significantly reduce computational costs without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and high computational overhead of state-of-the-art test-time scaling strategies in ATP models, particularly regarding token consumption and sampling costs.

Method: The authors propose two methods: a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism to reduce unnecessary token usage, and diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning with trainable prefixes to improve pass rates under reduced sampling budgets. These methods are combined into a unified EconRL pipeline.

Result: The proposed EconProver achieves performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art models but at only 12% of their computational cost, as demonstrated on miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper offers efficient strategies and practical insights for deploying lightweight ATP models, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

*Yu,Wang,Sheng Shen,R√©mi Munos,Hongyuan Zhan,Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA), a positional encoding method to address the limitations of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) in modeling long-context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of RoPE, which introduces a distance-dependent bias, thus affecting its ability to effectively handle long-range token interactions.

Method: The authors propose TAPA, introducing a learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. It aims to retain token interactions over long ranges and facilitate efficient extrapolation to unseen lengths.

Result: TAPA reduces perplexity significantly on long-context tasks compared to RoPE families and supports direct, lightweight fine-tuning for longer contexts.

Conclusion: TAPA overcomes RoPE's limitations and offers a robust solution for long-context modeling, with improved performance and extrapolation capabilities.

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

*Li Fu,Yu Xin,Sunlu Zeng,Lu Fan,Youzheng Wu,Xiaodong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The PAC framework significantly improves pronunciation modeling and homophone discrimination in LLM-based ASR systems, achieving notable reduction in Word Error Rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in pronunciation modeling and homophone discrimination in LLM-based ASR systems, especially for raw and long-tail word recognition.

Method: The framework integrates a two-stage approach: pronunciation-guided context learning using grapheme-phoneme modeling, and pronunciation-discriminative reinforcement learning with perturbed sampling.

Result: On English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets, the framework achieves up to 53.8% relative Word Error Rate reduction and up to 60.5% reduction in biased WER compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The PAC framework is highly effective in enhancing accurate recognition of pronunciations and long-tail words, making a significant impact on LLM-based ASR accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

### [62] [Don't Change My View: Ideological Bias Auditing in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12652)
*Paul Kr√∂ger,Emilio Barkett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of ideological steering in large language models (LLMs), proposing a statistical auditing method to detect potential bias in their output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs could influence public opinion through ideological bias, making it crucial to detect and address such steering attempts.

Method: The authors adapt a statistical method to identify ideological steering in LLMs by analyzing distributional shifts in model outputs across related prompts without accessing the model internals.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method's suitability for auditing proprietary systems and its practical efficacy in detecting ideological bias.

Conclusion: The method enables independent post hoc auditing of LLM behavior, providing a tool to identify and address potential ideological steering efforts.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

*Yougen Zhou,Qin Chen,Ningning Zhou,Jie Zhou,Xingjiao Wu,Liang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses strategy planning bias in emotional support conversations (ESC) using reinforcement learning with a dual reward function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with low accuracy and preference bias in delivering effective emotional support conversations.

Method: The proposed approach uses reinforcement learning with a dual reward function incorporating accuracy and entropy-based confidence to overcome LLM knowledge boundaries.

Result: Experiments on ESCov and ExTES datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses baseline models across multiple LLM backbones.

Conclusion: Revealing bias causes and implementing dual reward reinforcement learning leads to improved strategy planning in ESC, enhancing LLM performance.

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

*Zequn Xie,Chuxin Wang,Sihang Cai,Yeqiang Wang,Shulei Wang,Tao Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces modules MTG and MTI to enhance text-based person search by generating pseudo-labels and refining user queries, eliminating the need for manual annotations and improving retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scalability issue in text-based person search caused by the labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations.

Method: The paper proposes two modules: MTG, which uses simulated dialogues to generate pseudo-labels, and MTI, which dynamically refines user queries during inference through dialogue-based reasoning.

Result: The proposed method proves to be significantly accurate, robust, and user-friendly, achieving competitive or superior results without manual captions.

Conclusion: MTG and MTI create an annotation-free framework that enhances the scalability and practicality of TBPS systems for real-world applications.

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

### [65] [Towards Inclusive Toxic Content Moderation: Addressing Vulnerabilities to Adversarial Attacks in Toxicity Classifiers Tackling LLM-generated Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12672)
*Shaz Furniturewala,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in toxicity detection classifiers and proposes suppressing weak spots in model circuits to counter adversarial attacks, improving robustness and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased machine-generated content online, posing challenges to content moderation systems that struggle with misclassifications due to biases and adversarial attacks.

Method: The study uses mechanistic interpretability techniques to identify and suppress vulnerable circuits in fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa classifiers, tested across various datasets and demographic groups.

Result: It was found that different circuits in models were either essential for performance or susceptible to attacks. By suppressing vulnerable circuits, models showed better resistance to adversarial inputs and exposed fairness gaps across groups.

Conclusion: By addressing model vulnerabilities linked to demographic-specific circuits, the proposed method enhances the robustness and inclusivity of toxicity detection models against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

### [66] [Case-Based Decision-Theoretic Decoding with Quality Memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12677)
*Hiroyuki Deguchi,Masaaki Nagata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces case-based decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding to improve text generation quality, complementing minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR decoding improves text generation quality but struggles with out-of-domain knowledge capture due to its reliance on sample texts from the model.

Method: The authors propose CBDT decoding, which estimates expected utility using examples of domain-specific data instead of solely relying on model output.

Result: Compared to MAP decoding, CBDT decoding generates superior text quality, and a combination of CBDT and MBR decoding surpasses MBR alone across seven translation and image captioning tasks.

Conclusion: CBDT decoding enhances robustness in text generation tasks, especially in conjunction with MBR decoding, demonstrating broader applicability to domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

*Biswadip Mandal,Anant Khandelwal,Manish Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HistoryBank, a database of 10M+ multilingual historical events from Wikipedia for improving temporal reasoning in NLP tasks. It evaluates several large language models on a diverse set of temporal reasoning QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for enhanced benchmarking tools for temporal reasoning in NLP, as existing datasets are limited in scale, scope, and multilingual support, and focus mostly on contemporary events.

Method: The authors developed HistoryBank, a database of 10M+ historical events from Wikipedia across 10 languages. They then constructed a multilingual question-answering benchmark for six temporal reasoning tasks and evaluated multiple popular language models.

Result: GPT4o achieved the best performance across all tasks and languages, while Gemma-2 outperformed other smaller models. The database demonstrated strong potential for research in multilingual and temporal NLP.

Conclusion: HistoryBank provides a significant resource for advancing temporal and multilingual reasoning in NLP. The team will make the code and datasets publicly available to promote further research.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

*Omri Suissa,Muhiim Ali,Shengmai Chen,Yinuo Cai,Shekhar Pradhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to improve vision-language models' ability to recognize abstract concepts in images using a grouped image-caption dataset (MAGIC) and a grouped contrastive loss technique, resulting in the CLEAR GLASS model outperforming SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to better recognize abstract concepts in images, which extends beyond identifying individual objects and relationships.

Method: The paper introduces the MAGIC dataset and a grouped contrastive loss technique. The training process forces the model to encode higher-level concept information by aligning semantic representations for grouped image-caption pairs, using outer and inner contrastive losses.

Result: The CLEAR GLASS model developed using this methodology achieves better performance in recognizing abstract concepts compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Conclusion: Grouped contrastive loss and the MAGIC dataset effectively enhance VLMs‚Äô capacity for concept abstraction, establishing the CLEAR GLASS model as a promising advancement in abstract concept recognition.

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bottom-up approach for generating long-form documents using large language models (LLMs), focusing on a data-driven pipeline to reduce factual inaccuracies and ensure knowledge fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at text generation but struggle with long-form, factual documents grounded in external knowledge due to methods that disconnect planning and available knowledge.

Method: The proposed framework uses a 'Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure' approach: iterative retrieval from a knowledge base, followed by unsupervised clustering to create data-driven knowledge clusters, guiding document generation.

Result: The method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios requiring high knowledge fidelity and structural coherence.

Conclusion: The framework mitigates hallucination risks, establishes a structured, knowledge-constrained generation process, and introduces a paradigm for high-stakes, knowledge-intensive LLM applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether Arabic-language resources can enhance Maltese natural language processing (NLP) using cross-lingual augmentation techniques and novel transliteration systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the linguistic proximity between Maltese and Arabic and address the scarcity of Maltese NLP resources by exploring cross-lingual augmentation techniques.

Method: The paper investigates Arabic-Maltese alignment strategies, including transliteration schemes, machine translation methods, and introduces novel systems for Maltese transliteration.

Result: Arabic-based augmentations are shown to significantly improve performance on Maltese NLP tasks in several mono- and multilingual models.

Conclusion: Arabic resources can serve as an effective tool for advancing Maltese NLP by bridging linguistic gaps through innovative cross-lingual techniques.

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utility of LVLMs in advancing the performance of the M2E2 systems.

Method: A systematic evaluation of LVLMs like DeepSeek-VL2 and Qwen-VL on the M2E2 dataset, including text-only, image-only, and cross-media subtasks under few-shot prompting and fine-tuning conditions.

Result: 1) Few-shot LVLMs excel in visual but not textual tasks, 2) Fine-tuning with LoRA significantly improves performance, and 3) LVLMs show strong cross-modal capabilities.

Conclusion: While LVLMs have potential for M2E2, challenges like semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal grounding need further research.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

### [72] [The LLM Already Knows: Estimating LLM-Perceived Question Difficulty via Hidden Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12886)
*Yubo Zhu,Dongrui Liu,Zecheng Lin,Wei Tong,Sheng Zhong,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel and efficient method for estimating the difficulty of input questions for LLMs using hidden representations, avoiding costly methods like response sampling or model alterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately evaluating and adapting LLM inferences based on question difficulty often requires computationally expensive or generality-compromising approaches. A more efficient method is needed.

Method: The authors utilize hidden representations from the target LLM, modeling token generation as a Markov chain. A defined value function estimates output quality from initial hidden states without requiring token generation.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines in difficulty estimation across textual and multimodal tasks. It's shown to enhance adaptive reasoning strategies by improving inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Using hidden states for difficulty estimation is an effective and computationally efficient approach, enabling better adaptive reasoning and performance evaluation for LLMs.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer

*Shiyu Li,Yang Tang,Ruijie Liu,Shi-Zhe Chen,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Conan-embedding-v2 is a new 1.4B-parameter large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for text embedding tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data and training gaps between LLMs and dedicated text embedding models.

Method: Designed a new LLM integrating news and multilingual data; introduced a cross-lingual retrieval dataset; applied a soft-masking mechanism to bridge causal and bidirectional masks, and implemented dynamic hard negative mining.

Result: Achieved SOTA results on the MTEB and Chinese MTEB benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conan-embedding-v2 demonstrates that comprehensive pretraining and innovative training mechanisms can enable compact LLMs to excel in embedding tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

*Caiqi Zhang,Chang Shu,Ehsan Shareghi,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces graph-based methods for confidence estimation in reasoning tasks for large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing confidence estimation methods struggle to generalize to reasoning tasks, limiting the reliable deployment of LLMs.

Method: The authors propose training-free graph-based confidence estimation techniques that leverage graph properties like centrality, path convergence, and path weighting.

Result: Experiments on two LLMs and three reasoning datasets show improved confidence estimations and better performance in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Graph-based confidence estimation methods are effective for reasoning tasks, enhancing LLM reliability and performance.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA
tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we
propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods
tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed
graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

*Heng Zhang,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an end-to-end framework to automatically generate structured research workflows from academic papers, offering visualized insights into evolving scientific paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve research reproducibility and facilitate 'AI for Science' by addressing the lack of complete research workflow generation methods.

Method: The framework employs PU Learning with SciBERT for identifying workflow-descriptive paragraphs, Flan-T5 for generating workflow phrases, and ChatGPT for categorizing these phrases. The final output is structured into visual flowcharts.

Result: Achieved high performance in workflow identification (F1: 0.9772), phrasing (ROUGE-1: 0.4543), and categorization (Precision: 0.958), uncovering major methodological shifts in NLP research over two decades.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a robust, automated mechanism for researching workflows and reveals empirical trends in scientific methodologies.

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

*Yuval Weiss,David Demitri Africa,Paula Buttery,Richard Diehl Martinez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper systematically examines ReLoRA in small language models (SLMs) and finds it generally underperforms compared to standard training, especially as model size increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the efficacy of ReLoRA in pretraining small language models, which are computationally and environmentally more efficient.

Method: Systematic evaluation of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters) using ablation experiments, analyzing performance metrics like Paloma perplexity and BLiMP.

Result: ReLoRA performs worse than standard training, with larger performance gaps for bigger SLMs. It reinforces rank deficiencies in smaller models.

Conclusion: Low-rank update strategies like ReLoRA may not be suitable for SLM pretraining, emphasizing the need for further study in the low-compute domain.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task of adapting wine reviews across Chinese and English by incorporating cultural and taste preferences. It builds a parallel corpus and evaluates translation methods, showing current models struggle with cultural nuances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ability of large language models to adapt language tasks with cultural nuances, using wine reviews as a case study.

Method: Compiled a parallel corpus of 8k Chinese and 16k English wine reviews. Assessed translation models through benchmarks using automatic metrics and human evaluation with newly proposed cultural criteria.

Result: Analysis reveals that current models face significant challenges in accurately translating and adapting descriptions to align with cultural preferences.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for advances in translation models to better handle cultural nuances, emphasizing challenges in cross-cultural content adaptation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

*Jian Gao,Fufangchen Zhao,Yiyang Zhang,Danfeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SitLLM introduces a multimodal framework combining pressure sensing and large language models for enhanced sitting posture analysis and personalized feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing posture monitoring systems fail to provide fine-grained recognition and personalized semantic insights for users.

Method: SitLLM employs a three-component system: Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding for pressure mapping, Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment for semantic integration into LLMs, and Multi-Context Prompt Module for enhanced contextual instructions.

Result: Improved posture understanding and the generation of health-oriented, personalized responses effectively.

Conclusion: SitLLM addresses limitations of existing systems and enhances sitting posture monitoring with innovative sensor and language model integrations.

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective approach using fine-tuned small models for maritime intelligence by generating synthetic datasets with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges posed by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data, specifically in maritime intelligence.

Method: The authors use LLMs for synthetic dataset generation, transforming AIS vessel tracking records into Q&A pairs to fine-tune a smaller model.

Result: Achieved 75% accuracy with a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model, enabling a 261x cost reduction in maritime intelligence tasks.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned smaller models can match larger models' accuracy in specialized domains at significantly lower costs, aiding the development of domain-specific AI applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

*Francesco Pappone,Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni,Federico Califano,Niccol√≤ Gentile,Roberto Marras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semantic reward model within the GRPO framework to improve explanation clarity and alignment in complex text generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in aligning LLM outputs with goals like pedagogical soundness, overcoming limitations of existing reward models and brittle metrics.

Method: Proposed a semantic reward model based on cosine similarity using an encoder-only transformer within the GRPO framework for nuanced reward shaping.

Result: Achieved improved explanation faithfulness and clarity in Italian medical-school entrance exam tasks compared to supervised fine-tuning baseline.

Conclusion: Lightweight encoder models can effectively enhance rewards for complex tasks, advancing alignment techniques in text generation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

*Sijia Cui,Shuai Xu,Aiyao He,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PLAP framework to improve the grounding ability of LLMs in complex, long-horizon environments. It demonstrates significant performance improvements in strategy game scenarios, outperforming baseline and scripted agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges with LLM-based agents in long-horizon environments, where previous methods either produce unreliable actions or require expert guidance for task translation.

Method: The PLAP framework has three components: (1) a library of parameterized skills tailored to the environment, (2) an LLM-driven skill planner, and (3) a skill executor converting the skills into action sequences.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance of PLAP-driven agents, notably GPT-4o achieving high results in zero-shot settings and Qwen2-72B outperforming top-tier scripted agents.

Conclusion: PLAP successfully enhances the grounding ability of LLMs in complex environments and provides a benchmark for evaluating LLMs‚Äô long-horizon skill planning capabilities, with open-source code available for further research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

### [82] [LLM Hallucination Detection: A Fast Fourier Transform Method Based on Hidden Layer Temporal Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13154)
*Jinxin Li,Gang Tu,ShengYu Cheng,Junjie Hu,Jinting Wang,Rui Chen,Zhilong Zhou,Dongbo Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HSAD, an advanced method to detect hallucinations in large language models, using frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing hallucination detection methods, which either rely on external knowledge (limited in coverage) or static hidden-state analysis (unable to model dynamic reasoning deviations).

Method: The proposed method, HSAD, involves analyzing temporal dynamics of hidden representations during text generation. It extracts spectral features via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and leverages autoregressive modeling to pinpoint optimal observation points for enhanced detection capability.

Result: HSAD demonstrates over 10 percentage points improvement in detection efficiency on datasets like TruthfulQA compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: By integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain techniques, HSAD offers a reliable and effective framework for addressing hallucination in LLMs, marking a new direction in this field.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

*Yongjian Tang,Doruk Tuncel,Christian Koerner,Thomas Runkler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Excessive few-shot examples can diminish LLM performance (over-prompting). This research analyzes selection strategies, showing a balanced approach can improve outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-prompting challenges the assumption that more relevant few-shot examples always improve LLM performance, especially in the context of software engineering applications.

Method: The study evaluates three few-shot example selection methods‚Äîrandom sampling, semantic embedding, and TF-IDF vectors‚Äîon multiple LLMs, across two real-world datasets for software requirement classification.

Result: Incorporating too many domain-specific examples degrades performance in certain LLMs. An optimal number of selected examples avoids over-prompting, achieving up to a 1% improvement over the state-of-the-art in requirements classification.

Conclusion: Carefully selecting an optimal quantity of few-shot examples improves performance and avoids the pitfalls of over-prompting in LLMs.

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

*Jianfeng Zhu,Julina Maharjan,Xinyu Li,Karin G. Coifman,Ruoming Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer human personality traits, revealing limited alignment with validated psychological constructs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assess and improve the alignment of LLMs with nuanced human attributes, particularly personality traits, to expand their utility in conversational settings.

Method: Three evaluation paradigms were used: zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, LoRA-based fine-tuning with RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA architectures, and regression using embeddings from pretrained BERT and OpenAI models.

Result: All methods showed Pearson correlations below 0.26 between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits, indicating weak performance.

Conclusion: The current generation of LLMs struggles with accurately inferring human personalities, emphasizing the need for advancements in trait-specific prompting and context-aware alignment techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartGaze, an eye-tracking dataset capturing human gaze paths on charts, and proposes a gaze-guided attention technique to improve LVLMs' accuracy and interpretability in chart question-answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chart question answering (CQA) with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remains challenging due to models often attending to irrelevant parts of charts instead of focusing as humans do.

Method: Creating a human eye-tracking dataset (ChartGaze) and introducing gaze-guided attention refinement to align LVLMs' image-text attention with human gaze data.

Result: The gaze-guided method improves LVLMs' answer accuracy by up to 2.56 percentage points and enhances attention alignment across multiple models.

Conclusion: Incorporating human gaze data into LVLMs can significantly enhance their reasoning quality, accuracy, and interpretability when working on chart-focused tasks.

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations like context suffocation and noise contamination in current mono-contextual methods for AI research and synthesis by developing a scalable and effective approach.

Method: The novel method involves two key components: WebResearcher, which reformulates deep research as a Markov Decision Process with iterative report consolidation, and WebFrontier, a data synthesis engine that creates high-quality training data for research tasks.

Result: The proposed framework shows significant improvements in tool-use capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 6 challenging benchmarks, even compared to proprietary systems.

Conclusion: WebResearcher demonstrates capability in systematic knowledge discovery and synthesis, showing scalability via parallel thinking and enhancing training effectiveness, marking a step forward in automated deep-research systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex problem-solving by proposing Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT), resulting in the creation of a powerful model named AgentFounder-30B, which achieves state-of-the-art results on numerous benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training approaches for general-purpose LLMs underperform in agentic tasks due to optimization tensions caused by simultaneous learning of diverse behaviors and alignment with expert demonstrations.

Method: The authors introduce Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) to improve agentic foundational models and apply this method to develop a model named AgentFounder-30B.

Result: AgentFounder-30B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 10 benchmarks, including notable results like 39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

Conclusion: Incorporating Agentic CPT effectively addresses optimization tensions, and AgentFounder-30B sets a new standard in agentic problem-solving tasks, demonstrating significant advancements in tool-use and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentScaler, a system for enhancing the function-calling competence of Large Language Models via scalable, diverse simulated environments and a structured fine-tuning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world APIs require agents built on Large Language Models to possess advanced function-calling intelligence, which necessitates training in diverse environments for robustness.

Method: A scalable framework is designed to construct a variety of simulated environments paired with a two-phase fine-tuning strategy: initial broad training followed by specialized domain training.

Result: AgentScaler trained on agentic benchmarks demonstrates significant improvement in models' function-calling capabilities.

Conclusion: Scaling environments and using systematic training strategies enhance Large Language Models' agentic capabilities for practical applications.

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

### [89] [WebWeaver: Structuring Web-Scale Evidence with Dynamic Outlines for Open-Ended Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13312)
*Zijian Li,Xin Guan,Bo Zhang,Shen Huang,Houquan Zhou,Shaopeng Lai,Ming Yan,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Jun Zhang,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents WebWeaver, a new dual-agent AI framework for open-ended deep research (OEDR), integrating dynamic planning and targeted evidence synthesis to overcome limitations in current methods and achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI struggles with synthesizing web-scale data into coherent reports due to static pipelines and long-context issues like "loss in the middle" and hallucinations.

Method: WebWeaver employs a dual-agent framework: a 'planner' iteratively optimizes outlines while dynamically retrieving evidence, and a 'writer' composes reports section by section using hierarchical evidence retrieval.

Result: WebWeaver achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OEDR benchmarks such as DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearchGym.

Conclusion: Iterative planning and targeted synthesis are essential for creating accurate and structured AI-generated reports, as validated by WebWeaver's results.

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

*Xixi Wu,Kuan Li,Yida Zhao,Liwen Zhang,Litu Ou,Huifeng Yin,Zhongwang Zhang,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Minhao Cheng,Shuai Wang,Hong Cheng,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReSum, a novel paradigm enhancing language model-based web agents by addressing context window limitations through periodic context summarization, leading to improved performance in complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current large language model-based web agents in handling complex queries due to narrow context windows that get exhausted during extensive search cycles.

Method: The authors propose the ReSum paradigm, which converts interaction histories into compact reasoning states using periodic context summarization, and introduce ReSum-GRPO to adapt agents to this paradigm with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting.

Result: ReSum outperforms the baseline ReAct paradigm by an average of 4.5% across benchmarks, with further improvements of up to 8.2% following ReSum-GRPO training. The WebResummer-30B achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

Conclusion: ReSum enables web agents to perform indefinite exploration for complex queries and significantly boosts their effectiveness with minimal training resources, proving to be a superior approach to addressing context window limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

### [91] [Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13316)
*Millicent Li,Alberto Mario Ceballos Arroyo,Giordano Rogers,Naomi Saphra,Byron C. Wallace*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent methods using a second verbalizer LLM to interpret an LLM's internal representations often succeed without actually accessing the target model's internals. This indicates these methods primarily reflect the verbalizer's parametric knowledge rather than the insights into the target model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate whether activation verbalization approaches effectively reveal privileged insights into the internal workings of LLMs or merely describe input features, given the growing interest in interpreting LLM behavior.

Method: The authors critically assess verbalization methods across existing datasets and conduct controlled experiments isolating verbalizations to understand their dependence on the verbalizer LLM versus the target model activations.

Result: Findings show that verbalization methods succeed in benchmarks without accessing the target model's internals and are heavily influenced by the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM rather than the activations of the target model.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks and evaluation approaches for verbalization methods are insufficient. There is a need for more rigorous benchmarks and controlled experiments to determine if these methods genuinely illuminate LLM operations.

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop machine learning model, U-Mamba, achieving high accuracy in anatomical segmentation and 3D visualization across diverse datasets, improving preoperative planning and patient engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anatomical segmentation models lack the capacity to generalize well across various datasets. Better generalization can improve preoperative planning, visualization, and patient communication in medical contexts.

Method: The study utilized 120 breast MRI scans processed through anonymization, manual and automated segmentation using U-Mamba, and 3D visualization generation. Segmentation accuracy was iteratively refined using human-in-the-loop feedback, and results were quantitatively evaluated using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores as well as through clinician and patient interviews.

Result: The proposed model, U-Mamba, demonstrated high DSC values (0.97 for whole organs, 0.96 for fibroglandular tissue, and 0.82 for tumors) and successfully generated complex 3D reconstructions, enhancing clinical workflows and patient engagement.

Conclusion: The human-in-the-loop machine learning approach effectively generalizes segmentation models across imaging data, enhancing preoperative planning, intraoperative navigation, patient education, and decision-making in medical applications.

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study applies convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment images of TRISO fuel particle layers, significantly reducing manual labor and enhancing objectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing irradiation-induced changes in TRISO particle fuel morphology via post-irradiation microscopy is highly tedious and prone to subjectivity when done manually.

Method: Convolutional neural networks, including RU-Net (developed for this study), U-Net, ResNet, and Attention U-Net, were trained and tested on a dataset of over 2,000 annotated microscopic images of TRISO particles.

Result: RU-Net demonstrated superior performance among the tested CNN models in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU), showing its effectiveness for automatic image segmentation.

Conclusion: Implementing CNN models for automatic segmentation expedites analysis, reduces subjective bias, and substantially decreases manual effort in analyzing TRISO particle cross-sections.

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a hierarchical pipeline combining anomaly detection and status estimation to improve nutrient management in crops, highlighting efficiency and trade-offs between methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address inefficient nutrient management in agriculture by creating real-time optimization and energy-efficient methods to detect nutrient anomalies and estimate crop status.

Method: A tiered pipeline combining an autoencoder for anomaly detection and two status estimation methods: vegetation index-based machine learning (Random Forest) and raw image-based deep learning (Vision Transformer).

Result: The pipeline effectively detected nutrient depletion anomalies and provided accurate status estimation, with variations in accuracy and energy costs between RF and ViT methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights opportunities for combining efficient anomaly detection and high-accuracy state estimation in agriculture, enabling edge diagnostics and promoting agricultural sustainability.

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

Motivation: To address the challenge of interpreting multimodal humor and coherent narrative reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which is a critical aspect of social intelligence.

Method: The authors created the PixelHumor dataset and tested state-of-the-art LMMs on their ability to sequence panels and interpret humor embedded in comics.

Result: Leading LMMs performed poorly, achieving only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, showing a large gap compared to human performance.

Conclusion: Current LMMs lack robust integration of visual and textual cues for understanding humor and narrative coherence, and PixelHumor provides a framework to improve this aspect of AI.

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of online Human-Object Interaction (HOI) perception and generation, proposing new tasks and introducing the OnlineHOI framework to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for modeling Human-Object Interaction operate in an offline setting that does not fit the real-world context, where only current and past information can be used.

Method: The authors propose OnlineHOI, a framework based on the Mamba architecture that incorporates a memory mechanism to efficiently utilize historical data for online HOI tasks.

Result: OnlineHOI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in online generation tasks for Core4D and OAKINK2 datasets, as well as online perception tasks for HOI4D.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces new tasks and an effective framework to address the shortcomings of existing offline approaches for online HOI scenarios, advancing state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

Result: The paper identifies detrimental effects, such as privacy invasion, manipulation of public perception, and potential political and economic disruptions caused by misuse of deepfake technology.

Conclusion: While deepfake technology offers revolutionary capabilities, its misuse poses severe risks to social structures, requiring measures to mitigate its negative impacts.

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in

constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'

*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the simplicity bias (SB) in CLIP models, proposes a refined frequency-aware measure of SB, and examines its impact on various image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of simplicity bias in neural networks is pivotal to optimizing performance across complex tasks, particularly for image classification.

Method: The paper introduces a frequency-aware measure to capture SB differences and validates it on CLIP models under recent SB-modulation techniques. Additionally, it investigates SB's influence on model performance across various tasks (zero-shot and fine-tuning settings).

Result: The refined SB measure proved consistent and informative compared to older methods. A stronger SB was found beneficial for OOD generalization but less favorable for adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of aligning neural network inductive biases with task characteristics to improve performance and adaptability.

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

TL;DR: GraphDerm framework combines image analysis, scale calibration, and metadata using graph-based AI to outperform image-only pipelines in melanoma classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods for dermoscopy largely ignore patient metadata and scale information, limiting their effectiveness in melanoma triage.

Method: GraphDerm uses ISIC datasets, synthesizes ruler-embedded images, applies lesion segmentation models, performs scale regression, computes geometric descriptors, and employs spectral GNN for node classification.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in lesion segmentation (Dice ~0.9) and scale regression (MAE 1.5 px), while graph-based classification (AUC ~0.98) outperformed image-only models (AUC ~0.944).

Conclusion: Integrating calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata into population graphs leads to significant accuracy gains in melanoma classification, with promise for future refinement and broader applications.

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

*Wanru Zhuang,Wenbo Li,Zhibin Lan,Xu Han,Peng Li,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Position-Aware Text Image Machine Translation (PATIMT), which aims for fine-grained and layout-preserving text translations within images, alongside bounding boxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIMT approaches fail to offer position-specific translations and neglect layout preservation, calling for a more comprehensive solution.

Method: Proposed PATIMT approach, creating PATIMTBench with 10 scenarios, introducing an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement Pipeline for improved text localization, and providing fine-tuning for Large Vision-Language Models.

Result: State-of-the-art performance achieved in both region-specific and full-image grounding tasks; the new test set with 1,200 instances boosts evaluation reliability.

Conclusion: PATIMT demonstrates practical utility by enhancing TIMT, offering refined and scalable solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

TL;DR: The paper addresses domain adaptation challenges in cross-modal ship wake detection between optical and SAR images by proposing the SimMemDA framework, leveraging style transfer, instance-level filtering, and memory-guided calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in wake detection caused by the abstract and noisy nature of SAR images and the domain shift between SAR and optical imaging.

Method: The SimMemDA framework combines WakeGAN-based style transfer, instance-level feature similarity filtering, and feature memory guidance to mitigate domain shift and improve pseudo-label reliability.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate enhanced accuracy and robustness of cross-modal ship wake detection using the SimMemDA framework.

Conclusion: The proposed SimMemDA method validates its effectiveness for improving cross-modal ship wake detection through integrated adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

### [102] [Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via Physics-Guided Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12329)
*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach, Amplifier Air-Transformer, is proposed for seamless hourly air temperature data generation at 2 km resolution over the contiguous United States.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current air temperature monitoring lacks seamless spatiotemporal data despite the availability of weather stations and satellite measurements.

Method: They used a deep learning model combining neural networks encoded with annual temperature cycles, linear terms for amplification, and spatiotemporal convolutional layers to reconstruct and transform surface temperature data into air temperature.

Result: The model achieved an hourly air temperature mapping accuracy of 1.93¬∞C validated against weather station data spanning 77.7 billion pixels and 155 million records.

Conclusion: The technique streamlines temperature reconstruction and ensures high-resolution air temperature monitoring, offering potential for broader satellite applications.

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

*Anthony Miyaguchi,Chandrasekaran Maruthaiyannan,Charles R. Clark*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of general-purpose and domain-specific models for animal re-identification in the AnimalCLEF 2025 challenge. The results highlight the importance of domain-specific pre-training in fine-grained, limited-data tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in animal re-identification by comparing the effectiveness of general-purpose and domain-specific feature embeddings.

Method: The authors use two backbone models (general-purpose DINOv2 and domain-specific MegaDescriptor) combined with post-hoc metric learning and a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. They also apply a triplet-learning projection head to refine the embeddings.

Result: The domain-specific MegaDescriptor model outperformed the general-purpose DINOv2, as the triplet-learning head improved its performance by 0.13, compared to 0.03 for DINOv2. General-purpose embeddings were harder to adapt, evidenced by stagnant validation loss.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pre-training is critical for fine-grained, limited-data tasks. General-purpose features are less effective and harder to refine for these specialized cases.

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at
github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices by proposing GhostNetV3-Small, a model optimized for low-resolution tasks like CIFAR-10, achieving 93.94% accuracy without reliance on knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make state-of-the-art deep neural networks suitable for deployment on resource-limited edge devices and improve performance in low-resolution tasks like CIFAR-10.

Method: This study proposes GhostNetV3-Small by modifying the GhostNetV3 architecture and evaluates it alongside various knowledge distillation methods (traditional, teacher assistants, teacher ensembles).

Result: GhostNetV3-Small outperformed GhostNetV3 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving 93.94% accuracy. However, all examined distillation strategies reduced accuracy compared to baseline training.

Conclusion: Architectural adaptation, as demonstrated with GhostNetV3-Small, proved more effective than knowledge distillation for small-scale image classification tasks. Further research is recommended to enhance model design and distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that using raw UAV imagery provides better palm detection performance and localization accuracy compared to orthomosaic imagery, offering practical benefits for ecological monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of tree mapping using UAV imagery to enhance ecological monitoring and forest management, addressing limitations in current methods relying on orthomosaics.

Method: State-of-the-art detectors and keypoint models were employed to compare detection performance and localization accuracy between orthomosaic and raw UAV imagery, leveraging crown-center annotations.

Result: Raw UAV imagery enhances detection performance in deployment scenarios but orthomosaics are useful for robust cross-domain generalization. Crown-center annotations further improve localization accuracy.

Conclusion: Results highlight the benefits of raw UAV imagery and crown-center annotations for precise tree mapping, aiding biodiversity and conservation efforts.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

*Mayank Patel,Rahul Jain,Asim Unmesh,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MechBench, a dataset for studying mechanical assemblies, and proposes DYNAMO, a model predicting motion from static geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding motion in mechanical assemblies without relying on simplified kinematics or annotations is challenging.

Method: Introduced MechBench dataset and developed DYNAMO, a neural model targeting motion predictions from CAD point clouds.

Result: DYNAMO outperforms other models in predicting motion consistency and accuracy for gear assemblies.

Conclusion: MechBench and DYNAMO create a framework for studying coupled mechanical motion via data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

*Rui-Feng Wang,Mingrui Xu,Matthew C Bauer,Iago Beffart Schardong,Xiaowen Ma,Kangning Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cott-ADNet, a lightweight real-time detector for recognizing cotton bolls and flowers under complex field conditions, achieving strong performance metrics with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in cotton harvesting caused by manual labor, low efficiency, and yield loss, by developing an automated and accurate recognition system for cotton bolls and their maturity.

Method: The researchers developed Cott-ADNet, built on YOLOv11n, and enhanced it with NeLU-Global Attention and Dilated Receptive Field SPPF modules for better feature detection and multi-scale context modeling. They tested the model on a newly labeled dataset of 4,966 images and validated it using an external dataset of 1,216 field images.

Result: Cott-ADNet achieved strong performance metrics: 91.5% Precision, 89.8% Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score, while maintaining efficiency with only 7.5 GFLOPs. It demonstrated resilience to variations in scale and rotation.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet presents an accurate, efficient, and robust solution for automated cotton harvesting and phenotypic research in real-world scenarios, supported by the public release of code and dataset for further research.

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in transforming learning-based point cloud processing algorithms into real-world practices, focusing on challenges like data volume, scene content, and point density.

Method: Conducted a meta-review of deep learning methods and datasets for critical tasks supporting urban and environmental applications.

Result: Identified gaps and challenges in transitioning deep learning approaches to practical applications, providing broad insights in both algorithmic and practical contexts.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based point cloud methods hold potential but require further development to handle real-world issues like scalability and diversity in applications.

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Two-Stage Decoupling Framework (TSDF) to improve glaucoma prognosis using feature representation and attention-based mechanisms to handle variable-length inputs, enhancing performance in diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current glaucoma prognosis methods, including reliance on fixed-length inputs and the challenges posed by small dataset sizes.

Method: The TSDF consists of two stages: (1) feature representation using self-supervised learning to aggregate datasets, and (2) temporal aggregation with an attention-based mechanism for flexible processing of varying input lengths.

Result: The proposed framework improves performance on two benchmark glaucoma datasets‚ÄîOHTS and GRAPE‚Äîdespite their differences in scale and clinical settings.

Conclusion: The TSDF effectively addresses key challenges in glaucoma prognosis by enabling better data utilization and achieving robust results across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new training strategy for image tokenizers to improve generative models by addressing latent space discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image tokenizers face discrepancies between reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to suboptimal generative performance.

Method: A two-phase training scheme including latent perturbation for robustness during the main training and post-training for distribution alignment.

Result: The method achieves an impressive 1.36 gFID score, showing enhanced generation quality and broad applicability across various tokenizer types.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves latent space robustness and decoding accuracy, advancing the performance of generative image models significantly.

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large raw radar dataset and proposes Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT), achieving advancements in 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation for mmWave radars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the poor angular resolution of mmWave radars and the lack of standardized models or large datasets for improving radar-based sensing applications.

Method: The authors collect a large raw radar dataset with 1M samples and develop the Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT) model, leveraging raw data for better performance and running ablations to optimize design decisions.

Result: GRT demonstrates effective generalization across different scenarios, with improvements in angular resolution and data efficiency equivalent to a 10x increase, and predicts 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation with quality similar to higher resolution sensors.

Conclusion: The study shows that raw radar data utilization is critical and suggests that roughly 100M samples of data are necessary for GRT to realize its full potential in radar-based sensing applications.

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness of Vision-Language Models when facing real-world noisy inputs, as their performance under such conditions is not well-studied.

Method: Conducted controlled evaluations of state-of-the-art VLMs with different types of perturbations (e.g., lighting variations, motion blur, compression artifacts) and utilized both lexical-based and neural-based similarity metrics for assessment.

Result: Key findings include the high influence of ground-truth captions' descriptiveness, larger models showing better semantic understanding but inconsistent superiority over smaller models, and noise types like JPEG compression drastically impacting performance.

Conclusion: Provides insights into the trade-offs between model size, dataset attributes, and noise resilience, while establishing a benchmark for robust multimodal learning going forward.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IG-CAM, a novel Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) approach that achieves high-quality boundary-aware segmentation with image-level annotations. It sets new state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level annotations for segmentation are costly and time-consuming. The study aims to address this by improving WSSS models to achieve high-quality segmentation with only image-level annotations.

Method: The IG-CAM introduces (1) Instance-Guided Refinement for complete object coverage, (2) Influence Function Integration for robust features, and (3) Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement for sharp object boundaries.

Result: IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU scores of 82.3% (without post-processing) and 86.6% (with CRF post-processing) on PASCAL VOC 2012. The approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, precision, robustness, and efficiency.

Conclusion: IG-CAM sets a new benchmark for WSSS, providing an efficient and practical solution for scenarios lacking pixel-level annotations. It significantly improves object coverage and boundary precision.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end framework to create artist-style meshes directly from noisy or incomplete point clouds, using a novel 2D inpainting approach integrated with generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating artist-friendly meshes either assume clean input data or rely on multi-stage pipelines, which are impractical for real-world scenarios involving noisy or incomplete point clouds.

Method: The framework uses 3D point cloud refinement reformulated as a 2D inpainting task, leveraging generative models to refine the input point cloud and directly produce meshes.

Result: Preliminary results on the ShapeNet dataset show the framework's capability to produce clean, complete, artist-style meshes from imperfect input data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates potential for simplifying and enhancing mesh generation pipelines, making it feasible for real-world applications such as graphics rendering and animation.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

*Benjamin Vail,Rahul Harsha Cheppally,Ajay Sharda,Sidharth Rai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computer vision pipeline to estimate stalk diameter using RGB-D imagery, addressing limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve phenotyping in crop breeding by addressing labor-intensive and error-prone traditional stalk diameter measurement methods.

Method: The method integrates instance segmentation via deep learning, 3D point cloud reconstruction, and PCA-based axis-aligned slicing for diameter estimation.

Result: The proposed approach successfully mitigates challenges such as curvature, occlusion, and noise to provide reliable diameter estimates.

Conclusion: This work offers a scalable and robust computer vision solution for high-throughput phenotyping in crop breeding research.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

### [116] [Neural Collapse-Inspired Multi-Label Federated Learning under Label-Distribution Skew](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12544)
*Can Peng,Yuyuan Liu,Yingyu Yang,Pramit Saha,Qianye Yang,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an approach to improve federated learning (FL) performance in multi-label scenarios by addressing the challenges of data heterogeneity using neural collapse theory and feature disentanglement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the underexplored challenge of federated learning in multi-label scenarios, where diverse and skewed data distributions create difficulties in collaborative model training.

Method: The authors utilize neural collapse theory and introduce a feature disentanglement module to align and cluster feature distributions across clients. They also design regularization losses to ensure compact clustering in the latent feature space.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates promising results for improving FL performance in multi-label settings, enhancing the robustness of collaborative model training in scenarios with decentralized and heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

*Yingxin Lai,Zitong Yu,Jun Wang,Linlin Shen,Yong Xu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Agent4FaceForgery, a multi-agent framework to address challenges in face forgery detection by simulating human forgery creation and social media interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face forgery detection struggles with bridging the gap between offline datasets and real-world detection due to limitations in training data realism.

Method: The authors develop a multi-agent framework using language models equipped with memory and profile modules to simulate forgery creation in a social environment. Labels focus on text-image consistency rather than binary classification, supported by Adaptive Rejection Sampling for quality control.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements in forgery detectors using the proposed simulation-driven data samples.

Conclusion: Agent4FaceForgery enhances the realism of training data, improving the efficacy of face forgery detectors across architectures.

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

### [118] [Explicit Multimodal Graph Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12554)
*Wenxuan Ji,Haichao Shi,Xiao-Yu zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal graph network model (MGNM) for enhancing Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, leveraging advantages of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortcomings in Transformer-based methods for HOI detection by employing Graph Neural Networks, which are better suited for relational modeling between human-object pairs.

Method: Developed a multimodal graph network structure with four stages and introduced a multi-level feature interaction mechanism combining vision and language modalities.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on HOI benchmarks HICO-DET and V-COCO, with notable improvements when integrated with advanced object detection models.

Conclusion: MGNM effectively leverages GNN relational modeling to address HOI tasks, providing superior performance while balancing rare and non-rare class detections.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

*Kunliang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VQT-Light, a novel framework for lighting estimation based on VQVAE and ViT, achieving superior texture fidelity, speed, and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and efficient lighting estimation is important but existing methods either fail in texture details or performance efficiency.

Method: The framework, VQT-Light, combines VQVAE for discrete feature extraction and ViT for capturing global context to classify and estimate lighting maps.

Result: VQT-Light demonstrates superior performance, predicting detailed textures while achieving high inference speed (40FPS) and improved metrics.

Conclusion: VQT-Light offers a significant step forward in lighting estimation by combining innovative architectures, ensuring efficiency and superior fidelity.

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [120] [Adaptive Sampling Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12569)
*Qi Wang,Shuliang Zhu,Jinjia Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler for consistent distillation frameworks, optimizing timestep selection, trajectory sampling, and quality enhancements for diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distillation methods rely on fixed or constrained timestep strategies, limiting the flexibility and potential of diffusion models in real-world applications.

Method: The study introduces three key innovations: dynamic target timestep selection based on importance, optimized alternating sampling along the solution path, and quality techniques such as smoothing clipping and color balancing.

Result: The proposed scheduler improved the performance and flexibility of various distillation methods, delivering better results in challenging generation scenarios.

Conclusion: The adaptive sampling scheduler can enhance diffusion models' efficiency and adaptability, expanding their applicability in practical, complex generative tasks.

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

*Yizhen Lao,Yu Zhang,Ziting Wang,Chengbo Wang,Yifei Xue,Wanpeng Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DisorientLiDAR, a framework attacking LiDAR-based localization by strategically removing critical keypoints, degrading models' performance and inducing localization drift both in simulation and physical-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security challenge posed by adversarial attacks on LiDAR-based localization systems, especially for self-driving applications, which are underexplored compared to 3D perception attacks.

Method: The method revolves around reverse-engineering localization models to identify critical keypoints and removing these regions strategically within LiDAR data to disrupt localization accuracy. This attack was validated through experiments on models (HRegNet, D3Feat, GeoTransformer) and evaluated using the KITTI dataset.

Result: The experiments showed significant degradation in registration accuracy when top-K keypoints were removed. Tests on the Autoware platform highlighted noticeable localization drift, and physical-world experiments replicated these effects using infrared absorptive materials.

Conclusion: DisorientLiDAR proves effective in both simulated and physical environments, demonstrating the feasibility and general applicability of adversarial attacks on LiDAR-based localization systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

*Pengbo Guo,Chengxu Liu,Guoshuai Zhao,Xingsong Hou,Jialie Shen,Xueming Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the problem of reflection removal in images by introducing a novel Spectral Codebook approach, leveraging spectral learning and Transformer-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection removal in images is challenging due to overlapping reflection and transmission components which complicates clean background recovery.

Method: A Spectral Codebook is proposed to reconstruct the optical spectrum of reflection images, paired with spectral prior refinement modules and a Spectrum-Aware Transformer for handling spectral and pixel domains.

Result: Experimental results on three reflection benchmarks show superior performance and generalization of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The method effectively utilizes spectral properties to distinguish reflections, improving image restoration capabilities in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

*Liming Lu,Shuchao Pang,Xu Zheng,Xiang Gu,Anan Du,Yunhuai Liu,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Cyclic Iterative Adversarial Robustness Distillation (CIARD), which improves both robustness and clean performance for student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial robustness distillation methods compromise clean performance while enhancing robustness, owing to conflicts in optimization objectives and performance degradation from generated adversarial examples.

Method: The CIARD method introduces a multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment to address conflicting objectives and adversarial retraining to uphold teacher robustness against performance decay.

Result: CIARD improves adversarial defense rates by 3.53 on average and clean accuracy by 5.87 across datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet.

Conclusion: CIARD establishes a new benchmark for balancing robustness and generalization in student models, offering superior performance across diverse attack conditions.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

### [125] [Beyond Artificial Misalignment: Detecting and Grounding Semantic-Coordinated Multimodal Manipulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12653)
*Jinjie Shen,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Nan Pu,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for detecting and grounding semantically aligned manipulations in multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to reflect real-world manipulation patterns because they create artificial anomalies that are easily detected, hence not aligned with actual semantic-consistent multimodal manipulations.

Method: The authors developed the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM) dataset and introduced a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and Grounding (RamDG) framework that uses contextual evidence to trace and detect manipulations.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing methods by achieving 2.06% higher detection accuracy on the SAMM dataset compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The framework and dataset provide more realistic benchmarks and methodologies for detecting and analyzing semantically coherent manipulations in multimodal data. The dataset and code are made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MFAF method to tackle cross-view geo-localization challenges using advanced multi-frequency feature extraction and attention mechanisms, achieving competitive results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of significant appearance variations and difficulty in extracting discriminative features in cross-view geo-localization.

Method: The proposed MFAF method includes Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block (MFB) that captures multi-scale frequency features, and Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module to emphasize key regions in frequency features while reducing background noise.

Result: The MFAF method demonstrated competitive performance in drone localization and navigation on benchmarks like University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV.

Conclusion: The results indicate the effectiveness of combining multi-scale frequency analysis with adaptive attention mechanisms to enhance cross-view geo-localization tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

*Gordon Hung,Ivan Felipe Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates successive YOLO models' performance in underwater computer vision tasks, identifying YOLOv10 as optimal for speed-accuracy trade-offs on AUVs and providing open benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how newer YOLO models specifically perform in underwater environments with degraded imagery quality and limited computational resources on AUVs.

Method: YOLOv8-s to YOLOv11-s models were trained on two curated marine datasets using identical hyperparameters, then evaluated on metrics like precision, recall, mAP, and inference speed. Grad-CAM was employed for feature utilization analysis.

Result: While accuracy saturated with YOLOv9, inference speed progressively improved with later models. YOLOv10 emerged as the most efficient for underwater AUV applications.

Conclusion: YOLOv10 achieves the best balance of speed and accuracy for AUVs, and the study establishes reproducible benchmarks to facilitate marine computer vision research.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Conclusion: StereoCarla contributes to more robust stereo matching algorithms by significantly enhancing generalization accuracy and offering a scalable and compatible dataset for developing depth perception systems in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based

the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under

Motivation: Smoke significantly reduces visibility in early fire scene surveillance, hindering situational awareness and response, while current smoke removal progress is limited by the lack of suitable large-scale datasets.

Method: The authors created SmokeBench, a real-world dataset of paired smoke-free and smoke-degraded images, for supervised learning and evaluation of desmoking methods.

Result: The paper benchmarks various desmoking methods on their dataset, demonstrating its utility and robustness for improving image desmoking capabilities in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: SmokeBench facilitates advancements in practical image desmoking solutions for fire scenes, and the dataset is publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

### [130] [RIS-FUSION: Rethinking Text-Driven Infrared and Visible Image Fusion from the Perspective of Referring Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12710)
*Siju Ma,Changsiyu Gong,Xiaofeng Fan,Yong Ma,Chengjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIS-FUSION, a framework that combines image fusion and referring image segmentation using a new LangGatedFusion module. It includes a large-scale benchmark, MM-RIS, and achieves over 11% improvement in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven image fusion methods lack a clear task for supervising and evaluating text effectiveness. The paper aims to bridge this gap by aligning fusion with the goal of referring image segmentation.

Method: The proposed RIS-FUSION framework uses a cascaded design and incorporates the LangGatedFusion module to combine fusion and referencing through joint optimization. The work also introduces a new benchmark dataset, MM-RIS.

Result: RIS-FUSION demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with over 11% improvement in segmentation quality (mIoU) compared to current methods.

Conclusion: The paper successfully integrates text-driven image fusion and segmentation, providing a scalable benchmark and notable advancements in performance, showing promise for practical applications.

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at
https://github.com/SijuMa2003/RIS-FUSION.

*Haozhe Zhang,Chenchen Jing,Mingyu Liu,Qingsheng Wang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeFA, a novel method for improving generalization in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of recognizing unseen attribute-object compositions while combating the entangled nature of features and long-tailed data distributions.

Method: The authors propose a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework integrated with a debiasing strategy to synthesize high-quality compositional features, leveraging seen knowledge for generalization.

Result: The proposed method, DeFA, demonstrates superior performance on three standard datasets across both open-world and closed-world tasks.

Conclusion: DeFA is effective at enhancing feature augmentation and compositional generalization, setting a new benchmark for CZSL research.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

*Heng Zhang,Haichuan Hu,Yaomin Shen,Weihao Yu,Yilei Yuan,Haochen You,Guo Cheng,Zijian Zhang,Lubin Gan,Huihui Wei,Hao Zhang,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel architecture, AsyMoE, to address asymmetry issues in Mixture of Experts (MoE) for Large Vision-Language Models, achieving significant accuracy improvements and parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches, which fail to balance modality-specific features and cross-modal interactions due to asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing.

Method: The authors propose AsyMoE, which uses three specialized expert groups: intra-modality experts (for modality-specific tasks), hyperbolic inter-modality experts (for cross-modal hierarchical interactions), and evidence-priority language experts (to reduce parametric bias and retain context).

Result: AsyMoE achieves a 26.58% improvement in accuracy over the vanilla MoE and a 15.45% improvement over modality-specific MoE, while reducing parameter activation by 25.45% compared to dense models.

Conclusion: The AsyMoE architecture effectively addresses the asymmetry between visual and linguistic modalities in vision-language models, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces benchmarks for dynamic spatial reasoning involving partial observability and memory usage, and proposes a new memory mechanism for adaptive planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks mainly address static environments and lack evaluation for dynamic reasoning under partial observability and long-term memory constraints.

Method: Creation of two benchmarks: locally observable maze navigation and match-2 elimination, coupled with a subjective experience-based memory mechanism for task experience transfer.

Result: Experiments highlight limitations in mainstream models' dynamic spatial reasoning and memory abilities, showcasing the benchmarks' effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmarks offer a platform for assessing models in complex dynamic spatial reasoning, and pave the way for methodological advancements.

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

### [134] [SPGen: Spherical Projection as Consistent and Flexible Representation for Single Image 3D Shape Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12721)
*Jingdong Zhang,Weikai Chen,Yuan Liu,Jionghao Wang,Zhengming Yu,Zhuowen Shen,Bo Yang,Wenping Wang,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPGen, a single-view 3D generative model using a spherical projection representation to address issues like inter-view inconsistencies, complex internal structures, and challenging topologies in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of multiview diffusion priors in 3D generative models, such as view inconsistencies and difficulty in handling complex or intricate topologies.

Method: The model encodes geometry into a compact multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation, which maps the 3D object surface onto a bounding sphere and unwraps it as a 2D image. This provides a consistent, flexible, and efficient framework.

Result: Experiments showed that SPGen significantly improves geometric quality and computational efficiency over existing methods.

Conclusion: SPGen provides a powerful and efficient approach to generating 3D surfaces, addressing prior challenges in view consistency and topology representation while leveraging 2D diffusion priors.

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveVerse is a novel framework for simulating accurate RF signals and human motion in indoor environments, addressing challenges in RF sensing data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for high-quality RF data for privacy-preserving indoor perception tasks, but current methods struggle with dynamic and diverse environments.

Method: WaveVerse uses a language-guided 4D world generator for human motion generation and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator for RF signal simulation.

Result: The framework generated realistic RF signals, demonstrated improved beamforming and respiration monitoring, and provided performance gains in RF imaging and human activity recognition.

Conclusion: WaveVerse represents a breakthrough in RF data generation, offering scalable simulation capabilities and advancing RF sensing tasks in various conditions.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

*Yunhan Zhao,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Defense2Attack, a jailbreak method for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), leveraging weak defenses to boost attack effectiveness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in VLMs and improve jailbreak attacks in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: Defense2Attack incorporates a visual optimizer for adversarial perturbations, a textual optimizer using defense-styled prompts, and a red-team suffix generator for reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: Defense2Attack outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior jailbreak success in a single attempt across several models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel approach to enhance jailbreak techniques, highlighting the potential of integrating defensive patterns into the attack pipeline.

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

*Jiateng Liu,Hao Gao,Jiu-Cheng Xie,Chi-Man Pun,Jian Xiong,Haolun Li,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Gaussian management method for object reconstruction, improving efficiency and quality of models while using fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in Gaussian Splatting methods, including gradient conflicts due to indiscriminate attribute assignment and inefficient representation.

Method: A novel dynamic densification strategy supervised by a surface reconstruction module is proposed, alongside a lightweight Gaussian representation that adapts SH orders and pruning methods.

Result: Achieved superior reconstruction quality and efficiency with reduced model parameters, consistently outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach ensures enhanced performance and reduced parameters, is model-agnostic, and can be integrated into other frameworks.

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

### [138] [Modelling and analysis of the 8 filters from the "master key filters hypothesis" for depthwise-separable deep networks in relation to idealized receptive fields based on scale-space theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12746)
*Tony Lindeberg,Zahra Babaiee,Peyman M. Kiasari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes and models 8 "master key filters" extracted from deep networks based on the ConvNeXt architecture and demonstrates that these learned filters can be approximated by discrete scale-space filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and simplify the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks by modeling them through separable filtering operations and scale-space theoretical concepts.

Method: The authors compute spatial spread measures, model clustered filters using Gaussian kernel-based smoothing combined with difference operators, and fit the models using spatial variance and norms ($l_1$/$l_2$).

Result: Idealized models of receptive fields closely align with learned filters and exhibit predictive properties when substituted for these filters in ConvNeXt-based networks.

Conclusion: Learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be effectively approximated by discrete scale-space filters, offering a simplified and theoretical framework for their representation.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

*Rishab Parthasarathy,Jasmine Collins,Cory Stephenson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the differences in image quality evaluation between humans and multimodal large language models (LLMs), identifying attributes such as aesthetics and anatomical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how multimodal LLMs evaluate image quality and whether they align with human concepts like style and composition.

Method: The study curated synthetic image datasets and analyzed human preferences regarding image quality attributes, then compared them to LLM assessments.

Result: The analysis showed humans and LLMs perceive image attributes differently, with humans correlating attributes more strongly and some attributes like anatomical accuracy being harder for LLMs to evaluate.

Conclusion: This research highlights key differences in image quality perception between humans and LLMs, emphasizing challenges multimodal LLMs face in aligning with human judgment.

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

*Xiaohan Zhang,Si-Yuan Cao,Xiaokai Bai,Yiming Li,Zhangkai Shen,Zhe Wu,Xiaoxi Hu,Hui-liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReCOT, a Transformer-based model for cross-view object geo-localization, addressing limitations in robustness and error correction of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limitations of feature noise and lack of error correction in existing methods for cross-view object geo-localization.

Method: The paper proposes a Recurrent Cross-view Object geo-localization Transformer (ReCOT) that uses learnable tokens, a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy for semantic guidance, and a Reference Feature Enhancement Module (RFEM) for highlighting object-relevant regions.

Result: ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and significantly reduces model parameters by 60% compared to previous best-performing methods.

Conclusion: ReCOT effectively improves the accuracy and efficiency of cross-view object geo-localization by introducing innovative strategies and achieving superior results with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces A-TDOM, a method for near real-time True Digital Orthophoto Map generation using optimized 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDOM generation is hindered by delays and quality degradation caused by complex offline processes, inaccurate camera poses, DSM, and scene occlusions.

Method: The method involves On-the-Fly Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for pose estimation and sparse point cloud creation. It integrates and optimizes new Gaussian splatting regions for real-time orthogonal map rendering.

Result: Experimental benchmarks demonstrate near real-time TDOM rendering, with 3DGS optimization for each new image achieved in seconds while maintaining quality and geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: A-TDOM can enable faster and effective TDOM generation which is crucial for real-time geospatial applications while overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Result: DyGLNet showed superior performance on seven datasets, notably in boundary accuracy and small-object segmentation, with reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: DyGLNet is a promising solution for reliable and computationally effective medical image segmentation, with an emphasis on challenging areas like boundaries and small objects.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

### [143] [BATR-FST: Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12768)
*Mohammed Al-Habib,Zuping Zhang,Abdulrahman Noman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) face challenges in few-shot learning. To address this, this paper introduces BATR-FST, a two-stage approach that uses pre-training via Masked Image Modeling and meta-fine-tuning with adaptive token refinement strategies to enhance token representation and classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs have limitations in few-shot learning due to token-level interaction issues, limited training data, and weak inductive biases. Existing methods rely on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which miss critical refinements and global context incorporation.

Method: BATR-FST uses a two-phase approach: (1) pre-training with Masked Image Modeling for transferable patch-level representations and (2) meta-fine-tuning with a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module featuring Token Clustering, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting, Bi-Level Attention, Graph Token Propagation, and a Class Separation Penalty.

Result: Experiments on three few-shot learning benchmarks show superior performance of BATR-FST in 1-shot and 5-shot settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving few-shot classification with transformers.

Conclusion: BATR-FST successfully addresses few-shot learning challenges in Vision Transformers through advanced token refinement and adaptive strategies, offering strong results and improving few-shot classification outcomes.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation

### [144] [CECT-Mamba: a Hierarchical Contrast-enhanced-aware Model for Pancreatic Tumor Subtyping from Multi-phase CECT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12777)
*Zhifang Gong,Shuo Gao,Ben Zhao,Yingjing Xu,Yijun Yang,Shenghong Ju,Guangquan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced approach using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) with a specific Mamba module for improved subtyping of pancreatic tumors, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was driven by the challenges posed by high heterogeneity and variability in pancreatic tumors, which make precise subtyping and diagnosis difficult using existing methods.

Method: The paper proposes a novel dual hierarchical Mamba module that combines spatial and temporal modeling of multi-phase CECT scans, emphasizing intra and inter-phase contrast variations. Additional modules for local tumor refinement and efficient semantic encoding are utilized to enhance learning.

Result: The proposed method was tested on a clinical dataset of 270 cases, achieving an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).

Conclusion: The system demonstrates significant potential as an accurate and efficient diagnostic tool for pancreatic tumor subtyping, addressing the limitations of prior methods and improving diagnostic workflows.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

*Zhehao Li,Yucheng Qian,Chong Wang,Yinghao Lu,Zhihao Yang,Jiafei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces improved Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection with enhanced context modeling using affordance-guided reasoning, prompts, and attention mechanisms, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detection methods struggle to model complex interactions due to incomplete context representation.

Method: The authors propose a Contextualized Representation Learning Network incorporating affordance-guided reasoning and learnable prompts integrated with visual cues via attention mechanisms.

Result: The method significantly outperforms previous approaches, showing superior results on HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enriches HOI detection with contextual features, offering robust reasoning for complex human-object interactions and making notable advancements in performance metrics.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

*Jonas Werheid,Shengjie He,Aymen Gannouni,Anas Abdelrazeq,Robert H. Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach using synthetic data and computer vision for visual assembly control in manufacturing, specifically targeting resource-limited SMEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for efficient quality control in manufacturing assembly processes, while addressing the high cost and resource demands of traditional computer vision methods, making them more accessible to SMEs.

Method: The method involves simulated scene generation based on CAD data and object detection algorithms to create an efficient image generation pipeline for training computer vision models.

Result: The proposed approach achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95) of 99.5% on synthetic data and 93% on real-world data, demonstrating effective performance in identifying planetary gear system components.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can provide a resource-efficient and practical solution for visual assembly control in manufacturing, offering significant potential for SMEs to implement cost-effective quality control.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

### [147] [Double Helix Diffusion for Cross-Domain Anomaly Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12787)
*Linchun Wu,Qin Zou,Xianbiao Qi,Bo Du,Zhongyuan Wang,Qingquan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a framework to generate realistic anomaly images and masks for manufacturing inspection, overcoming structural inconsistencies and feature entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic data methods for anomaly detection are inadequate due to issues with structural inconsistency in anomaly generation and feature entanglement between images and annotation masks.

Method: DH-Diff uses a double helix-inspired architecture with domain-decoupled attention for separate feature enhancement and a semantic score map alignment module for structural authenticity. It incorporates text prompts and optional graphical guidance for flexible control.

Result: DH-Diff produces anomaly images with higher diversity and realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in synthetic data generation, which leads to better downstream anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed DH-Diff framework effectively addresses limitations in current methods by enabling high-fidelity anomaly image generation and significantly enhances anomaly detection in manufacturing.

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SPAM, a framework for generating accurate and regular superpixels using a combination of pretrained models and fine-tuned segmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify image representation and computational complexity by creating superpixels that balance regularity and object alignment.

Method: SPAM uses pretrained models and feature extraction techniques to create semantic-agnostic, regular superpixels for both general and interactive segmentation tasks.

Result: SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms existing superpixel generation methods on segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SPAM is a robust, versatile tool for generating high-quality superpixels, providing advancements in segmentation accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

### [150] [SAGA: Selective Adaptive Gating for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12817)
*Yuan Cao,Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGA, an approach to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of linear attention in Transformers, addressing key feature redundancy and alignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear attention methods suffer from low-rank feature maps due to uniform compression of historical key-value information, causing suboptimal performance compared to softmax-based attention.

Method: The SAGA mechanism employs input-adaptive learnable gates to modulate key-value map aggregation and introduces an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition for gate computation without memory overhead.

Result: SAGA achieves significant computational benefits with 1.76√ó higher throughput, 2.69√ó GPU memory savings, and up to 4.4% accuracy boost on ImageNet compared to PVT-T.

Conclusion: SAGA successfully enhances semantic diversity in linear attention, addresses directional alignment issues, and delivers state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates medical imaging encoders pre-trained on 3.5M chest X-rays to improve performance across various radiology tasks. It observes that MI2 and RAD-DINO excel in different domains and highlights the advantages of structured supervision and center-specific pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of foundation vision encoders like CLIP and DINOv2 for general-purpose imaging, their medical imaging counterparts are constrained by smaller datasets. This limits our understanding of how scaling data and adapting pretraining paradigms impact medical imaging models' performance.

Method: The authors conducted continual pretraining of MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO vision encoders on 3.5M chest X-rays using consistent compute resources and evaluation protocols. They evaluated tasks such as classification, segmentation, and report generation, incorporating structured supervision through UniCL.

Result: MI2 demonstrated stronger scaling in finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO excelled in tube-related tasks. Structured supervision with UniCL gradually improved MI2's performance, and it was shown that as few as 30k in-domain samples could surpass open-weights foundation models.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the utility of center-specific continual pretraining and structured supervision, suggesting that medical institutions can significantly enhance medical imaging model performance by leveraging their in-domain data.

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

TL;DR: This paper combines two perceptual metrics, DISTS and VMAF, using fusion strategies to improve the evaluation of NeRF-generated outputs by aligning better with subjective quality scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating NeRF-generated outputs is challenging due to their unique artifacts and the inefficacy of individual metrics across various datasets.

Method: Two perceptual metrics, DISTS and VMAF, were fused using two normalization and two fusion strategies. The resulting metrics are tested on Synthetic and Outdoor datasets with three configurations.

Result: Fusion metrics demonstrated improved correlation with subjective quality scores compared to individual metrics.

Conclusion: Combining DISTS and VMAF through fusion strategies enhances the robustness and generalizability of evaluation metrics for NeRF-generated outputs.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

TL;DR: The study examines using large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic visual training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. Results show an F1 score of 88% using only synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of collecting sufficient data for certain AI tasks, especially for rare or costly scenarios. The study aims to address this issue for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses by leveraging LLM capabilities.

Method: The paper maps visual data of canine muscles/joints to a textual domain suitable for LLMs. Using techniques like guided decoding, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, it generates 1,000 synthetic visual documentations and evaluates them.

Result: The synthetic data effectively represents location and severity of diagnoses, achieving an F1 score of 88% when training a model on this data and testing it on real-world documentations.

Conclusion: LLM-generated synthetic data shows promise for reducing data scarcity, especially for rare conditions. While focused on the medical domain, the approach has broader applicability.

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Cumulative Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric for evaluating object detection models without ground-truth annotations, enabling continuous monitoring in real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployment of object detection models is challenging in real-world scenarios due to the lack of ground-truth annotations for evaluation and monitoring purposes.

Method: CCS leverages test-time data augmentation, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented views, measures spatial consistency via IoU overlaps, and normalizes these as a reliability proxy without requiring annotations.

Result: CCS demonstrated strong consistency with established metrics like F1-score and Probabilistic Detection Quality, achieving over 90% congruence in experiments on datasets such as Open Images and KITTI.

Conclusion: CCS provides a reliable, model-agnostic solution for monitoring object detection models in deployment, highlighting under-performing cases while enabling DevOps-style operations.

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

TL;DR: This paper proposes PENet, a framework for few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, addressing challenges of intra-class diversity and inter-set inconsistency through a dual-stream learner architecture and prototype alignment mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in existing prototype-based approaches for few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, such as failure to represent intra-class diversity and misalignment between support and query set feature spaces.

Method: The method involves using a dual-stream learner architecture with an Intrinsic Learner and a Diffusion Learner to construct prototypes. A Prototype Assimilation Module aligns prototypes with the query space, and a Prototype Calibration Mechanism prevents semantic drift.

Result: Experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets show PENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: This study introduces an effective framework for addressing challenges in few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation, leveraging diffusion models and dual prototypes to achieve superior segmentation performance.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

TL;DR: Lego-Edit proposes an instruction-based image editing framework using Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) to generalize effectively for diverse, real-world user instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods struggle to generalize to diverse real-world user instructions due to limitations in their training domains, which restricts their practical use.

Method: Lego-Edit employs a model-level toolkit composed of diverse, pre-trained models with various image manipulation functions, alongside a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach to enhance MLLM's ability to reason with open-domain instructions.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like GEdit-Bench and ImgBench show Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art performance, robustly reasoning with open-domain instructions and integrating new editing tools without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Lego-Edit demonstrates significant advancements in instruction-based image editing by leveraging MLLMs and innovative training strategies to handle diverse user inputs effectively while maintaining adaptability.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising

*Weiming Chen,Zhihan Zhu,Yijia Wang,Zhihai He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles shortcomings in RF models, proposing methods to improve inversion accuracy and disentangle multimodal attention for better generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF models excel in generative tasks but lack consistency and precise attention control in real-world applications.

Method: The paper introduces high-order inversion via the Runge-Kutta solver and Decoupled Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA) for refined attention mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on image reconstruction and text-guided editing show state-of-the-art fidelity and editability.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively enhance RF models' inversion accuracy and attention control while achieving robust application outcomes.

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

### [158] [MEJO: MLLM-Engaged Surgical Triplet Recognition via Inter- and Intra-Task Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12893)
*Yiyi Zhang,Yuchen Yuan,Ying Zheng,Jialun Pei,Jinpeng Li,Zheng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO), to address challenges in surgical triplet recognition caused by inter-task and intra-task optimization conflicts and class imbalances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve surgical triplet recognition, a complex task hampered by optimization conflicts and long-tailed data distributions in existing multi-task learning paradigms.

Method: The authors propose the MEJO framework, which includes a Shared-Specific-Disentangled learning scheme to separate task-shared and task-specific representations, utilizes a Multimodal Large Language Model for expert semantic enhancement, and introduces a Coordinated Gradient Learning strategy to balance gradients from imbalanced datasets.

Result: Experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets showed the proposed framework effectively handles both inter- and intra-task optimization conflicts, leading to superior recognition performance.

Conclusion: The MEJO framework demonstrates its effectiveness in mitigating optimization conflicts in surgical triplet recognition, with potential for broader applicability in other scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable collaborative embodied dialog tasks where effective communication is essential for navigation success.

Method: Develop DialNav with a Navigator and Guide interacting in multi-turn dialog, collect the RAIN dataset, and establish benchmarks for holistic evaluation of navigation and dialog.

Result: Released the RAIN dataset and benchmark results from analyzing Navigator and Guide models in the dialog task.

Conclusion: The study addresses challenges in embodied dialog tasks, releases tools for research, and encourages advancements in effective communication for collaborative navigation.

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

### [160] [Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing: Enhancing Visual Understanding via Sustained Focus on Key Objects in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12897)
*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Chong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS), an approach to improve Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by maintaining sustained focus on key objects in images, enhancing their visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LVLMs accurately locate key objects in images, their attention spans are brief, limiting their potential visual understanding capabilities. This motivated the development of a method to sustain focus and enhance performance.

Method: The proposed CLVS incorporates a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution across layers. Vision memory is initialized with unbiased visual attention in the first layer and updated iteratively in subsequent layers. Smoothing stops when uncertainty indicates completed visual understanding.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance across various visual understanding tasks, particularly excelling in relation and attribute understanding.

Conclusion: Sustaining attention on key objects improves LVLMs' visual understanding. CLVS is effective and generalizable, enhancing performance significantly on multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

### [161] [MSGFusion: Multimodal Scene Graph-Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12901)
*Guihui Li,Bowei Dong,Kaizhi Dong,Jiayi Li,Haiyong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion is a novel infrared and visible image fusion framework integrating multimodal scene graphs for enhanced high-level semantics and low-level details in fusion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing methods that rely on low-level visual cues and struggle to incorporate high-level semantic information for effective image fusion.

Method: Developing MSGFusion, which leverages structured scene graphs from both text and vision to enhance semantic representation and refine fusion via successive modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion.

Result: Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks showed MSGFusion's superiority in detail preservation, structural clarity, semantic consistency, and generalizability for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MSGFusion significantly enhances performance in infrared-visible image fusion tasks and downstream objectives through its multimodal scene graph-guided approach.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

*Branko Mitic,Philipp Seeb√∂ck,Helmut Prosch,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative anomaly detection (AD) approach for medical imaging, achieving improved anomaly segmentation results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in anomaly detection, such as variability in pulmonary anatomy, for better lesion localization and segmentation in medical imaging.

Method: The method leverages image-to-image translation for anomaly-free reconstruction followed by patch similarity scoring to localize anomalies.

Result: The approach improved anomaly segmentation accuracy on two datasets: chest CT scans (+1.9% relative DICE score) and T1-weighted brain MRI (+4.4% relative DICE score).

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates enhanced performance and generalizability, making it promising for medical AD and segmentation tasks across imaging modalities.

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

*Hojat Ardi,Amir Jahanshahi,Ali Diba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in aerial object tracking and introduces T-SiamTPN, a tracking framework with advanced temporal modeling for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of existing trackers, such as their ineffectiveness in handling temporal dependencies and non-linear appearance changes during aerial tracking.

Method: The proposed T-SiamTPN extends SiamTPN with temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions for improved temporal consistency and feature representations.

Result: T-SiamTPN achieves significant performance gains over the baseline, improving the success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The inclusion of temporal modeling enhances tracking robustness, and T-SiamTPN stands out as a computationally efficient solution suitable for real-world applications, even on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

### [164] [A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achiev-ing Real-Time Aerial Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12918)
*Melika Sabaghian,Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad,Seyyedeh Mahila Moghadami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-stage compression pipeline to efficiently deploy YOLOv8 for aerial object detection on edge devices, reducing model size and computational complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to the need for compression without compromising performance.

Method: The three-stage compression pipeline combines sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning using batch normalization scaling factors, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) to optimize the YOLOv8 model.

Result: The approach achieves a significant reduction in model parameters (73.51%), FLOPs, and MACs for YOLOv8m, enhancing inference speed from 26 FPS to 45 FPS and further to 68 FPS using TensorRT, with minimal performance loss in AP50.

Conclusion: The proposed compression method is both effective and practical, enabling real-time deployment of YOLOv8 on edge devices for high-throughput scenarios while retaining strong accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

*Shipeng Liu,Ziliang Xiong,Khac-Hoang Ngo,Per-Erik Forss√©n*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a regression-based method for point cloud registration (PCR) quality validation, emphasizing detailed misalignment quantification over classification approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing methods which classify PCR quality into broad categories, by proposing a regression-based method for fine-grained registration quality estimation.

Method: The paper applies regression for PCR quality validation, introduces multiscale feature extraction, and employs attention-based methods for aggregating misalignment-related features.

Result: The proposed method achieves accurate and robust registration error estimation across diverse datasets, including point clouds with varying spatial densities.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms classification-based state-of-the-art methods, particularly in improving mapping quality for downstream tasks like re-registration.

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 4DRadar-GS, a framework using 4D radar data to improve self-supervised 3D reconstruction in dynamic driving scenes. It overcomes challenges like imprecise motion estimation and weak temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised 3D reconstruction methods struggle with dynamic objects due to motion estimation inaccuracies and temporal inconsistencies.

Method: The framework uses a 4D Radar-assisted Gaussian initialization to enhance dynamic object segmentation and depth recovery, coupled with a Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model for tracking dynamic trajectories.

Result: Tested on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieved state-of-the-art results in reconstructing dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS successfully enhances precision and temporal consistency in 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving applications by leveraging 4D radar data.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for scene understanding, introducing a method to holistically describe objects using multiview CLIP feature aggregation, enabling improved 3D open-vocabulary object extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in accurate 3D scene understanding, which creates constraints for its usage in applications like AR/VR and robotics.

Method: The authors introduced object-level Gaussian decomposition with multiview CLIP feature aggregation to generate comprehensive "bags of embeddings". This approach supports text-based object retrieval and facilitates 2D and 3D adaptation tasks.

Result: The proposed method achieves effective 3D open-vocabulary object extraction and remains on par with state-of-the-art performance in 2D open-vocabulary segmentation, showing its versatility and accuracy.

Conclusion: The method bypasses traditional rendering methods for semantic understanding, offering a new framework for precise object-level 3D scene analysis that promises wider applicability in AR/VR and robotics.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fine-grained mixing strategy (TMKT) for enhancing knowledge transfer between RGB and event-based camera (DVS) data in spiking neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs while transferring semantic knowledge between RGB and DVS modalities.

Method: The TMKT strategy mixes RGB and DVS inputs at different time-steps while introducing modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives to support label mixing during cross-modal training.

Result: The proposed method smooths the knowledge transfer process, reduces modality shift, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks across various datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of TMKT with auxiliary learning objectives effectively bridges the modality gap, improving energy-efficient visual processing. The approach is validated with strong experimental results.

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating interactive segmentation masks using user clicks, focusing on complex multi-surface segmentation scenarios. It includes a novel evaluation metric and supports multi-modal inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient and accurate method for interactive segmentation, especially in challenging scenarios with multiple, entangled, or adjacent surfaces.

Method: The method utilizes a network architecture that processes RGB images, non-RGB modalities, erroneous masks, and encoded clicks to predict better segmentation masks. The architecture ensures ease of integrating interaction data post feature extraction and multi-modal fusion.

Result: The proposed method reduces segmentation effort, as measured by a decrease in NoC@90, by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on the DeLiVER dataset and 1.19 on MFNet. The RGB-only baseline also achieved competitive or superior results in simpler segmentation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates the advantages of multi-modal segmentation and an effective architecture design, excelling in both multi-surface and single-mask segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

Motivation: The need for robust text line segmentation systems in historical document analysis due to challenges like irregular handwriting, faded ink, and overlapping lines, coupled with a lack of large annotated datasets for supervised learning.

Method: The introduction of the FEST competition with tasks designed for segmenting text lines in the U-DIADS-TL dataset using only three annotated images per manuscript for training, emphasizing few-shot learning.

Result: Participants are encouraged to create adaptable systems for the diverse dataset of ancient manuscripts, which mimics real-world conditions with challenges like varied layouts and degradation.

Conclusion: The competition is expected to advance the development of practical, low-annotation methods for historical document analysis, aiding humanities scholars and promoting the adoption of automated tools.

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and compare retrieval methods for protein surface shapes using molecular surface descriptors such as electrostatic potential.

Method: Evaluated 15 methods proposed by 9 teams on 11,555 protein surfaces, focusing on metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Result: The best performance was achieved by methods integrating electrostatic potential with molecular surface shape, especially for limited data classes.

Conclusion: Incorporating electrostatic potential enhances protein surface retrieval, emphasizing the necessity of additional molecular descriptors.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

### [172] [Improving Accuracy and Efficiency of Implicit Neural Representations: Making SIREN a WINNER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12980)
*Hemanth Chandravamsi,Dhanush V. Shenoy,Steven H. Frankel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WINNER, an adaptive weight initialization method to overcome SIRENs' limitations in fitting signals outside their frequency support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIRENs, used for signal representation, can fail when the target's frequency spectrum misaligns with the network's capabilities, resulting in a 'spectral bottleneck.'

Method: WINNER perturbs uniformly initialized SIREN weights with Gaussian noise, guided by the spectral centroid of the target signal, without adding trainable parameters.

Result: WINNER improves SIRENs' performance in audio fitting, image modeling, and 3D shape fitting tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed method mitigates spectral bias and demonstrates robust initialization strategies, opening new avenues for adaptive and efficient deep neural network training.

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DR-MoE framework to identify incorrect user actions from egocentric video, focusing on rare and subtle mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting rare and ambiguous mistakes in egocentric video data, which are often subtle and infrequent.

Method: DR-MoE framework with two stages: feature extraction via ViViT models and expert modules; classification using three specialized objectives and aggregation using expert modules.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated strong performance, especially in detecting rare and ambiguous mistakes.

Conclusion: The DR-MoE method effectively handles imbalance and subtle mistakes, enhancing calibration and generalization for mistake identification in video analysis.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

### [175] [Brought a Gun to a Knife Fight: Modern VFM Baselines Outgun Specialized Detectors on In-the-Wild AI Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12995)
*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Jinhua Zeng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current detectors of AI-generated images fail in real-world scenarios, but a linear classifier based on modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) outperforms specialized detectors by a significant margin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized detectors perform poorly in detecting AI-generated images in uncontrolled real-world situations due to high false-negative rates.

Method: A linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model (VFM) was used and trained on identical datasets to compare against existing bespoke detectors.

Result: The VFM-based classifier improved in-the-wild accuracy by over 20% compared to specialized detectors. Alignment of synthetic images with forgery-related concepts in modern VFM contributed to its success.

Conclusion: Modern VFMs outperform specialized detectors in real-world detection tasks, and evaluation methods must use test data independent of pre-training data for true generalization assessment.

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

*Anton Eldeborg Lundin,Rasmus Winzell,Hanna Hamrell,David Gustafsson,Hannes Ovr√©n*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an energy-efficient drone detection system using neuromorphic cameras and spiking neural networks, deployable on neuromorphic chips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing threat of small drones to military and civilian infrastructure, ensuring efficient, automated, and early detection.

Method: The system uses spiking neural networks with neuromorphic cameras for detection. It employs neuromorphic chips, enabling a fully neuromorphic energy-efficient setup.

Result: The system achieves high energy efficiency compared to edge GPU solutions, operating on battery for over a year. It utilizes synthetic data for training and relies on drone shape for detection.

Conclusion: This small, low-power system is feasible for deployment in contested or remote areas, offering a highly effective and portable solution for drone detection.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

### [177] [Dream3DAvatar: Text-Controlled 3D Avatar Reconstruction from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13013)
*Gaofeng Liu,Hengsen Li,Ruoyu Gao,Xuetong Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Tao Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dream3DAvatar, a framework for creating realistic and controllable 3D avatars from a single image using text-driven controls and advanced multi-view modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the challenge of reconstructing 3D avatars from single images, as current methods struggle with controlling geometry and texture in occluded areas due to limited monocular input.

Method: Dream3DAvatar employs a two-stage approach. The first stage uses adapters to enhance multi-view image generation with pose and facial identity consistency. Text descriptions are generated to improve controllability. The second stage uses a feedforward Transformer for high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat reconstructions.

Result: The Dream3DAvatar framework successfully creates realistic 3D avatars ready for animation, showing superior performance over existing methods in multiple evaluation criteria.

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar advances 3D avatar generation by integrating multi-view synthesis, text-driven control, and reconstruction techniques into an efficient pipeline, addressing occlusion limitations and outperforming baseline approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

### [178] [Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031)
*Yan Chen,Long Li,Teng Xi,Long Zeng,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage reinforcement learning framework to improve visual perception and reasoning capabilities in vision-language models, producing a model named PeBR-R1 with superior performance across multiple visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the reasoning performance of vision-language models (VLMs) due to the suboptimal application of reinforcement learning methods developed for large language models.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework where Stage 1 improves visual perception and Stage 2 enhances reasoning capabilities. Dataset-level sampling is used to mitigate vanishing advantage issues.

Result: The resulting model, PeBR-R1, demonstrates significantly improved performance in visual reasoning tasks across seven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning techniques can be tailored for VLMs to successfully enhance both perception and reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

*Xu Li,Yuxuan Liang,Xiaolei Chen,Yi Zheng,Haotian Chen,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HERO, a framework for efficient token utilization in High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models, optimizing computational efficiency without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of computational and memory overhead posed by the increased number of visual tokens in HR-LVLMs using a divide-and-conquer method.

Method: The proposed HERO framework employs content-adaptive token allocation and function-aware selection to estimate tile importance and selectively retain tokens for efficient processing, without retraining.

Result: HERO shows an improved efficiency-accuracy balance over multiple benchmarks and model scales, functioning in a training-free manner.

Conclusion: The findings provide both theoretical insights and a practical approach to enhance HR-LVLM efficiency, reducing computational overhead without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

*Qianqi Lu,Yuxiang Xie,Jing Zhang,Shiwei Zou,Yan Chen,Xidao Luan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TFANet addresses challenges in Referring Image Segmentation by enhancing multimodal alignment between language and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RIS methods struggle with multimodal misalignment and semantic loss, especially in complex scenes.

Method: TFANet introduces a three-stage hierarchical framework to systematically improve alignment: Knowledge Plus Stage, Knowledge Fusion Stage, and Knowledge Intensification Stage.

Result: The approach improves semantic exchange, feature alignment, and compensates for semantic degradation to enhance performance in RIS.

Conclusion: TFANet systematically improves multimodal alignment, overcoming challenges in complex referring image segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLFDisc, a U-shaped deep network with advanced mechanisms for frequency-aware enhancement, leveraging a novel distribution-aware loss using KL-Divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Fourier Frequency fitting methods relying on pixel-wise loss tend to overemphasize local features, causing loss of global information.

Method: The authors introduce LLFDisc, combining cross-attention and gating mechanisms and utilizing a novel KL-Divergence-based loss for Fourier domain alignment and structural fidelity.

Result: Experiments across various benchmarks show LLFDisc outperforms existing approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: LLFDisc enhances frequency-domain and structural fidelity performance and represents a robust alternative to traditional methods for Fourier-domain information processing.

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework using a dual-network and addressing noisy pseudo-label issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised approaches are needed as labeling data for medical image segmentation can be resource-intensive and impractical.

Method: A Cross Consistency Enhancement module and dynamic weighting using uncertainty-aware mechanisms are employed alongside contrastive learning to improve 3D segmentation.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance (e.g., 89.95% Dice score on Left Atrial with only 10% labeled data) across three datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves segmentation quality and its components are validated through ablation experiments.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfake technology poses significant
challenges to digital security and authenticity. Detecting these forgeries,
especially across a wide spectrum of manipulation techniques, requires robust
and generalized models. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Deep Fusion
Framework (HDFF), an ensemble-based deep learning architecture designed for
high-performance facial forgery detection. Our framework integrates four
diverse pre-trained sub-models, Swin-MLP, CoAtNet, EfficientNetV2, and DaViT,
which are meticulously fine-tuned through a multi-stage process on the
MultiFFDI dataset. By concatenating the feature representations from these

leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of
0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position
out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex

*Ruibo Li,Hanyu Shi,Zhe Wang,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces weakly and self-supervised methods for class-agnostic motion prediction using LiDAR point clouds, significantly reducing annotation requirements while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous driving systems to understand motion in dynamic environments without relying on extensive labeled data for motion prediction.

Method: The authors propose using foreground/background or non-ground/ground masks as weak supervision cues for self-supervised motion prediction. Additionally, they introduce Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss to improve learning by suppressing outliers.

Result: The proposed methods reduce annotation requirements (as low as 0.01%) and outperform existing self-supervised methods, with weakly supervised models rivaling supervised counterparts.

Conclusion: Weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion prediction methods are effective in minimizing annotation effort, while maintaining high performance, suggesting their practical application for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (CRPS-D) and proposes a semi-supervised approach (SS-PSD) to enhance detection performance, demonstrating superior results over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing parking slot detection datasets (e.g., scale, real-world noise) and the challenges of manual data annotation in real-world conditions.

Method: The authors constructed a diverse and large-scale dataset (CRPS-D) and developed a semi-supervised parking slot detection model (SS-PSD) based on a teacher-student architecture and techniques like confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.

Result: The SS-PSD method outperformed state-of-the-art solutions in parking slot detection tasks, particularly showing better performance with increased unlabeled data.

Conclusion: CRPS-D and SS-PSD significantly advance parking slot detection capabilities. The study provides public access to both the dataset and source code for further research.

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

*Minqing Huang,Shouyi Lu,Boyuan Zheng,Ziyao Li,Xiao Tang,Guirong Zhuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework for 4D radar point cloud super-resolution that ensures high-quality reconstructions with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods in 4D radar super-resolution, such as high training costs, high inference latency, and poor generalization.

Method: The paper presents MSDNet, combining reconstruction-guided feature distillation and diffusion-guided feature distillation with an adaptive noise alignment mechanism.

Result: MSDNet achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference, outperforming existing approaches in 4D radar point cloud super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: This work offers a computationally efficient and accurate framework for 4D radar point cloud super-resolution, with improvements in downstream tasks and public code availability.

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show
TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness
contributes to state-of-the-art TAR performance.

*Zhihao He,Tianyao He,Tieyuan Chen,Yun Xu,Huabin Liu,Chaofan Gan,Gui Zou,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that uses graphs to represent and fuse knowledge from multiple videos for better video language model reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video reasoning models struggle with spatio-temporal incompleteness, causing inaccuracies when processing individual videos.

Method: Proposed a Video Structuring Module to create spatio-temporal graphs for video representation and a Graph Fusion Module to combine data from related videos. The fused output is fed into a language model as a structured prompt.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved reasoning capabilities in video language models using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses video reasoning challenges, showcasing its potential to significantly advance multi-video language model research.

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WHU-STree, a multi-city, richly annotated dataset designed for street tree inventory tasks using multi-modal data, addressing the limitations of traditional surveys and existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional field surveys for street tree inventory are slow and labor-intensive, while existing automated datasets are limited in scale, annotation, and modality.

Method: The creation of WHU-STree dataset involves synchronized point clouds and high-resolution images gathered across two cities, annotated with 21,007 tree instances representing 50 species and multiple parameters.

Result: The WHU-STree dataset enables more than 10 street tree inventory tasks, with experiments highlighting the utility of multi-modal data and identifying challenges like cross-domain application and multi-modal fusion.

Conclusion: WHU-STree offers significant utility for urban tree analysis, emphasizing the potential of multi-modal approaches and outlining future directions for improved management tools.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

*Yingtai Li,Haoran Lai,Xiaoqian Zhou,Shuai Ming,Wenxin Ma,Wei Wei,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to significantly enhance medical vision-language pre-training by automating label extraction and improving vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of generating large-scale labeled datasets for medical AI systems and improving performance in vision-language alignment tasks.

Method: Modern LLMs were used to extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports, creating cost-effective 'silver-standard' datasets. Vision encoders trained on these datasets were then used to advance vision-language alignment.

Result: The study showed that diagnostic labels extracted by LLMs achieved >96% AUC in precision, comparable to specialized BERT-based models. The approach achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks in diagnosis and retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Utilizing LLMs facilitates scalable and high-performance vision-language pre-training for medical AI, democratizing access to large datasets and advancing state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

TL;DR: The paper develops benchmarks and evaluates methods for road-obstacle video segmentation, introducing strong baselines that set a new state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires consistent road-obstacle segmentation across consecutive frames for safe navigation, but current methods fail to capture temporal dynamics.

Method: The authors curate four road-obstacle video segmentation benchmarks and evaluate 11 segmentation methods, while introducing two strong baselines based on vision foundation models.

Result: The proposed baselines achieve state-of-the-art performance in long-range video road-obstacle segmentation.

Conclusion: Road-obstacle segmentation is inherently temporal, and leveraging this property yields better results and informs future research directions.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video
sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Result: Vi-SAFE achieves 0.88 accuracy on the RWF-2000 dataset, outperforming TSN alone (0.77) and other methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Vi-SAFE demonstrates strong potential for effective and efficient violence detection in public safety surveillance applications.

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,
and real-time temporal analysis. We propose Vi-SAFE, a spatial-temporal
framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network
(TSN) for video surveillance. The YOLOv8 model is optimized with GhostNetV3 as
a lightweight backbone, an exponential moving average (EMA) attention
mechanism, and pruning to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets,
where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of
violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE
achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming
existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its
effectiveness for public safety surveillance. Code is available at

*Fei Wang,Xuecheng Wu,Zheng Zhang,Danlei Huang,Yuheng Huang,BoWang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces End4, a method to detect images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, addressing gaps in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to detect images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, posing risks of misuse.

Method: The method uses End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4) with a reconstruction model and a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) for feature extraction and refinement.

Result: End4 generalizes well to unseen masking patterns, demonstrates robustness under perturbations, and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: End4 enhances detection capabilities for diffusion inpainting models, offering a robust and generalized approach for identifying such images.

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

*Hugo Carlesso,Josiane Mothe,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight self-supervised learning framework for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) aimed at efficient onboard satellite processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI data is high dimensional, and satellite data transfer rates are slow, necessitating compact, efficient processing to minimize redundant data transmission.

Method: CMTSSL combines masked image modeling, spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzles, and curriculum learning to progressively train models for HSI with lightweight architectures.

Result: The CMTSSL approach shows consistent performance gains on benchmark datasets, using architectures over 16,000x lighter than current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CMTSSL effectively improves representation learning using lightweight models suitable for onboard satellite HSI analysis, with verified gains in segmentation tasks. Public code is available.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due
to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research
introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise

requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from
vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by
image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour

parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The
model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ResidualViT, a vision transformer that efficiently computes frame-level features for dense video tasks by leveraging temporal redundancies and employing token reduction and lightweight distillation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational inefficiencies of extracting frame-level features in video tasks requiring high temporal resolution.

Method: ResidualViT uses learnable residual connections for temporal consistency, token reduction for discarding redundant video data, and a lightweight distillation approach for approximating original feature representations.

Result: ResidualViT achieves up to 60% computational cost reduction and speeds up inference by up to 2.5x across various tasks and datasets, while retaining accuracy close to the original model.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture offers computational efficiency and faster processing for temporally dense video tasks, making it an effective replacement for traditional frame-level feature extraction methods.

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of traditional radiology training, which relies on either passive exposure or real-time supervision, and lacks scalable, immediate feedback for learners.

Method: The platform, RadGame, combines gamification with AI-powered feedback using vision-language models and radiology report generation metrics. It utilizes public datasets for validation and provides structured feedback for localization and reporting tasks.

Result: Participants using RadGame showed a substantial improvement: 68% in localization accuracy and 31% in report-writing accuracy, compared to significantly lower improvement using traditional methods.

Conclusion: RadGame demonstrates the potential of AI-driven gamification to enhance scalable and feedback-enriched radiology training, rethinking the use of medical AI for educational purposes.

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

Motivation: Enhance the practical use and photorealism of AI-generated images by addressing the need for consistent realness and identifying flaws.

Method: Utilizes vision-language models trained on large datasets to both assess overall image realness and pinpoint visual inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The framework is effective in assessing and improving the realness of AI-generated images, aiding both evaluation and feedback during training.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated

realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

*Zefan Qu,Zhenwei Wang,Haoyuan Wang,Ke Xu,Gerhard Hancke,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyleSculptor introduces a training-free method for generating 3D assets in a user-defined style, enabling precise texture and geometry control without prior training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the challenge of creating 3D assets with controllable styles to match specific texture and geometric patterns of existing designs, particularly useful in gaming and virtual reality applications.

Method: The proposed method integrates a Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module for dynamic cross-3D attention and feature fusion combined with a Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism for exclusive texture or geometry stylization and adjustable style intensity.

Result: StyleSculptor demonstrates superior performance over existing methods in generating high-fidelity 3D assets that accurately adapt style provided by the user in terms of both geometry and texture.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that StyleSculptor successfully achieves style-guided 3D asset creation in a zero-shot manner, offering practical tools for precise and customizable 3D generation without requiring pre-training.

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

TL;DR: SR-3D introduces a model that integrates 2D images and multi-view 3D data for improved spatial understanding through a shared token space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between 2D visual data and 3D spatial reasoning, enabling enhanced 3D scene understanding using 2D priors.

Method: Enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, and allowing flexible region prompting with bounding boxes, segmentation masks, or direct 3D annotations.

Result: SR-3D achieves state-of-the-art results on both general 2D vision-language and specialized 3D benchmarks, showing strong spatial reasoning across frames.

Conclusion: SR-3D effectively unifies 2D and 3D representations, demonstrating its utility for scene understanding and real-world applications, even without ground-truth 3D data.

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

### [201] [IsoSched: Preemptive Tile Cascaded Scheduling of Multi-DNN via Subgraph Isomorphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12208)
*Boran Zhao,Zihang Yuan,Yanbin Hu,Haiming Zhai,Haoruo Zhang,Wenzhe Zhao,Tian Xia,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: IsoSched is a novel system for efficient scheduling of multiple DNNs with complex topologies, overcoming the inefficiencies of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging applications like autonomous driving require preemptive scheduling of DNNs to handle critical tasks with strict latency constraints. Existing solutions either lack support for preemption or suffer from high overheads, necessitating a more efficient framework.

Method: IsoSched introduces an integer-linear program (ILP) and subgraph isomorphism-based approach, incorporates Layer Concatenate and Split (LCS) for load balancing, accelerates subgraph matching with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-enhanced Ullmann algorithms, and uses compressed matrix encoding for memory efficiency.

Result: IsoSched surpasses conventional LTS-based and TSS-based methods in latency-bound throughput, speed, energy efficiency, and critical task satisfaction across various task complexities.

Conclusion: The IsoSched framework provides a highly efficient solution for preemptive multi-DNN scheduling in Tile Spatial Scheduling architectures, making it suitable for latency-critical applications with complex graph topologies.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural network (DNN) accelerators with Layer Temporal
Scheduling (LTS) often incurs significant overheads (e.g., energy and latency),
as intermediate activations must be cached in DRAM. To alleviate this, Tile
Spatial Scheduling (TSS) reduces such costs by fragmenting inter-layer data
into smaller tiles communicated via on-chip links.However, many emerging
applications require concurrent execution of multiple DNNs with complex
topologies, where critical tasks must preempt others to meet stringent latency
requirements (e.g., in autonomous driving, obstacle detection must complete
within tens of milliseconds). Existing TSS works lack support for preemption,
while prior preemption schemes rely on LTS and thus inherit its overheads. This
highlights the need for preemptive and efficient TSS-based frameworks. Yet,
realizing such systems is challenging due to the complexity of enabling
preemption in graphs with large-scale topologies (e.g., modern large language
models may contain tens of thousands of edges). To tackle this, we present
IsoSched, the first framework enabling preemptive multi-DNN scheduling on TSS
architecture. IsoSched first formulates scheduling of complex-topology graphs
as an integer-linear program (ILP) and subgraph isomorphism problem; second, it
applies Layer Concatenate and Split (LCS) for load balancing in tile pipelines;
third, it employs an Ullmann-based algorithm enhanced by Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to accelerate subgraph matching, and uses compact matrix encoding
(i.e., Compressed Sparse Row, CSR) to reduce memory usage. IsoSched outperforms
LTS-PRM approaches (i.e., PREMA, Planaria, CD-MSA, MoCA) in Latency-Bound
Throughput (LBT), speedup, and energy efficiency, and achieves higher critical
task satisfaction than TSS-NPRM (i.e., HASP) across varying task complexities.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TinyServe is a serving system for tiny LLMs that reduces memory and latency overhead during decoding by using structured KV sparsity, plugin-based token selection, and hardware-efficient kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency in serving large language models (LLMs) caused by high memory usage and latency overhead from key-value (KV) cache accesses.

Method: It introduces a system named TinyServe, which uses structured KV sparsity, a query-aware page selection mechanism, and fused CUDA kernels to optimize memory and computation during autoregressive decoding.

Result: TinyServe achieves up to 3.4x faster decoding speeds and over 2x memory savings with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates practical benefits for LLM training and inference on resource-constrained hardware, showcasing its potential as an efficient solution for serving smaller language models.

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently remains challenging due to
the high memory and latency overhead of key-value (KV) cache access during
autoregressive decoding. We present \textbf{TinyServe}, a lightweight and
extensible serving system for deploying tiny LLMs (e.g., TinyLLaMA, GPT2-345M)
with support for structured KV sparsity, plugin-based token selection, and
hardware-efficient attention kernels. Unlike prior simulation frameworks,
TinyServe executes real-time decoding with configurable sparsity strategies and
fine-grained instrumentation.
  To reduce decoding cost, we introduce a \textit{query-aware page selection}
mechanism that leverages bounding-box metadata to estimate attention relevance
between the query and KV cache blocks. This enables selective KV loading with
minimal overhead and no model modifications. Our fused CUDA kernel integrates
page scoring, sparse memory access, and masked attention in a single pass.
  Experiments show that TinyServe achieves up to \textbf{3.4x} speedup and over
\textbf{2x} memory savings with negligible accuracy drop. Additional analysis
of cache reuse, page hit rate, and multi-GPU scaling confirms its practicality
as an efficient system-level design for LLM training and inference research on
resource-constrained hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the increasing complexity and frequent faults in large-scale cloud systems, necessitating efficient, accurate, and interpretable fault diagnosis solutions.

Method: The KylinRCA framework combines temporal causal discovery for fault propagation chains, cross-modal graph learning for root cause localization, and mask-based explanation methods for auditable evidence.

Result: The proposed framework is evaluated through a multi-dimensional experimental scheme with clarified indicators, successfully addressing major challenges in fault diagnosis under full-stack observability.

Conclusion: The work offers an effective, interpretable solution for RCA in complex systems by integrating dynamic causal discovery and cross-modal fusion approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid development of cloud computing and ultra-large-scale data
centers, the scale and complexity of systems have increased significantly,
leading to frequent faults that often show cascading propagation. How to
achieve efficient, accurate, and interpretable Root Cause Analysis (RCA) based
on observability data (metrics, logs, traces) has become a core issue in AIOps.
This paper reviews two mainstream research threads in top conferences and
journals over the past five years: FaultInsight[1] focusing on dynamic causal
discovery and HolisticRCA[2] focusing on multi-modal/cross-level fusion, and
analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods. A KylinRCA
framework integrating the ideas of both is proposed, which depicts the
propagation chain through temporal causal discovery, realizes global root cause
localization and type identification through cross-modal graph learning, and
outputs auditable evidence chains combined with mask-based explanation methods.
A multi-dimensional experimental scheme is designed, evaluation indicators are
clarified, and engineering challenges are discussed, providing an effective
solution for fault diagnosis under full-stack observability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in achieving peak performance and performance portability on new CPU architectures with enhanced vectorization capabilities.

Method: A study of molecular docking application performance using compiler auto-vectorization and explicit vectorization across different CPU architectures, including x86 and ARM.

Result: x86 CPUs deliver higher execution performance due to wider vectorization units, while ARM CPUs have advantages in energy consumption and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: Certain code transformations enable competitive auto-vectorization comparable to explicit vectorization, suggesting strategies for developing performance-portable scientific applications.

Abstract: Recent trends in the HPC field have introduced new CPU architectures with
improved vectorization capabilities that require optimization to achieve peak
performance and thus pose challenges for performance portability. The
deployment of high-performing scientific applications for CPUs requires
adapting the codebase and optimizing for performance. Evaluating these
applications provides insights into the complex interactions between code,
compilers, and hardware. We evaluate compiler auto-vectorization and explicit
vectorization to achieve performance portability across modern CPUs with long
vectors. We select a molecular docking application as a case study, as it
represents computational patterns commonly found across HPC workloads. We
report insights into the technical challenges, architectural trends, and
optimization strategies relevant to the future development of scientific
applications for HPC. Our results show which code transformations enable
portable auto-vectorization, reaching performance similar to explicit
vectorization. Experimental data confirms that x86 CPUs typically achieve
higher execution performance than ARM CPUs, primarily due to their wider
vectorization units. However, ARM architectures demonstrate competitive energy
consumption and cost-effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of cloud and edge computing for AI/ML, particularly issues like network congestion, energy use, and computational constraints.

Method: Developed SynergAI, which combines performance characterization, offline and online decision-making policies to schedule tasks architecture-aware across edge and cloud systems.

Result: Implemented within Kubernetes, SynergAI reduced Quality of Service violations by an average of 2.4x compared to a State-of-the-Art solution.

Conclusion: Architecture-driven inference serving can significantly optimize performance and efficiency across diverse hardware, addressing challenges in edge-to-cloud AI deployments.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
has significantly heightened computational demands, particularly for
inference-serving workloads. While traditional cloud-based deployments offer
scalability, they face challenges such as network congestion, high energy
consumption, and privacy concerns. In contrast, edge computing provides
low-latency and sustainable alternatives but is constrained by limited
computational resources. In this work, we introduce SynergAI, a novel framework
designed for performance- and architecture-aware inference serving across
heterogeneous edge-to-cloud infrastructures. Built upon a comprehensive
performance characterization of modern inference engines, SynergAI integrates a
combination of offline and online decision-making policies to deliver
intelligent, lightweight, and architecture-aware scheduling. By dynamically
allocating workloads across diverse hardware architectures, it effectively
minimizes Quality of Service (QoS) violations. We implement SynergAI within a
Kubernetes-based ecosystem and evaluate its efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that architecture-driven inference serving enables optimized and
architecture-aware deployments on emerging hardware platforms, achieving an
average reduction of 2.4x in QoS violations compared to a State-of-the-Art
(SotA) solution.

### [207] [The Entropy of Parallel Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12256)

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical framework based on entropy to assess system incompatibility and computational performance, finding a strong negative correlation between entropy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the role of entropy as a measure of incompatibility affecting computational performance in parallel clusters, including top supercomputers.

Method: The authors developed a mathematical theory combining graph theory and logarithms to calculate system entropy in parallel clusters and applied this model to analyze the Top 10 supercomputers.

Result: Their findings show a statistically significant negative correlation between system entropy and computational performance, as demonstrated by measures like LINPACK (r = -0.7832, p = 0.0077), MLPerf (r = -0.6234), and HPCC composite scores (r = -0.5890).

Conclusion: Lower entropy in systems corresponds to higher computational efficiency, and their framework can generalize across different computational workloads beyond traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Ever since Claude Shannon used entropy for his "Mathematical Theory of
Communication", entropy has become a buzzword in research circles with
scientists applying entropy to describe any phenomena that are reminiscent of
disorder. In this paper, we used entropy to describe the incompatibility
between components in the computer, which can cause noise and disorder within
the parallel cluster. We develop a mathematical theory, primarily based on
graph theory and logarithms, to quantify the entropy of a parallel cluster by
accounting for the entropy of each system within the cluster. We proceed using
this model to calculate the entropy of the Top 10 supercomputers in the Top500
list. Our entropy framework reveals a statistically significant negative
correlation between system entropy and computational performance across the
world's fastest supercomputers. Most notably, the LINPACK benchmark
demonstrates a strong negative correlation (r = -0.7832, p = 0.0077) with our
entropy measure, indicating that systems with lower entropy consistently
achieve higher computational efficiency, this Relationship is further supported
by moderate correlations with MLPerf mixed-precision benchmarks (r = -0.6234)
and HPCC composite scores (r = -0.5890), suggesting the framework's
applicability extends beyond traditional dense linear algebra workloads.

Result: The paper provides practical lessons and performance characteristics of vector databases applied to HPC systems, with a focus on the biological-text workload.

Conclusion: This work serves as a foundational step towards characterizing and optimizing the performance of vector databases on HPC systems, enabling better support for scientific and AI workflows.

Abstract: Vector databases have rapidly grown in popularity, enabling efficient
similarity search over data such as text, images, and video. They now play a
central role in modern AI workflows, aiding large language models by grounding
model outputs in external literature through retrieval-augmented generation.
Despite their importance, little is known about the performance characteristics
of vector databases in high-performance computing (HPC) systems that drive
large-scale science. This work presents an empirical study of distributed
vector database performance on the Polaris supercomputer in the Argonne
Leadership Computing Facility. We construct a realistic biological-text

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governments are investing massively in AI development through initiative infrastructures like AI Factories, but existing HPC systems lack user-friendly environments and capabilities supporting AI services.

Method: A dual-stack approach is proposed to integrate HPC systems with cloud-native technologies for improved usability and operational accessibility within AI Factories.

Result: The paper offers insights into bridging HPC and cloud-native technologies to amplify their mutual strengths and discusses models such as "Serverless HPC" and "High-performance Cloud."

Conclusion: Converging HPC and cloud-native systems provides the performance and usability needed for sustainable technological autonomy in AI, benefiting Sovereign AI programs.

Abstract: The strategic importance of artificial intelligence is driving a global push
toward Sovereign AI initiatives. Nationwide governments are increasingly
developing dedicated infrastructures, called AI Factories (AIF), to achieve
technological autonomy and secure the resources necessary to sustain robust
local digital ecosystems.
  In Europe, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking is investing hundreds of millions of
euros into several AI Factories, built atop existing high-performance computing
(HPC) supercomputers. However, while HPC systems excel in raw performance, they
are not inherently designed for usability, accessibility, or serving as
public-facing platforms for AI services such as inference or agentic
applications. In contrast, AI practitioners are accustomed to cloud-native
technologies like Kubernetes and object storage, tools that are often difficult
to integrate within traditional HPC environments.
  This article advocates for a dual-stack approach within supercomputers:
integrating both HPC and cloud-native technologies. Our goal is to bridge the
divide between HPC and cloud computing by combining high performance and
hardware acceleration with ease of use and service-oriented front-ends. This
convergence allows each paradigm to amplify the other. To this end, we will
study the cloud challenges of HPC (Serverless HPC) and the HPC challenges of
cloud technologies (High-performance Cloud).

TL;DR: This paper presents a joint client scheduling and bandwidth allocation (JCSBA) algorithm to address modal heterogeneity in multimodal federated learning (MFL), focusing on wireless deployment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in tackling modal heterogeneity in multimodal federated learning across diverse clients while ensuring privacy and addressing challenges like limited communication bandwidth and latency in wireless scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces the JCSBA algorithm, leveraging a decision-level fusion architecture with added unimodal loss functions. It minimizes a theoretical bound related to client and modality scheduling under various constraints.

Result: Experimental outcomes show that JCSBA improves multimodal accuracy by 4.06% and unimodal accuracy by 2.73% over conventional algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed JCSBA algorithm enhances performance in multimodal accuracy and unimodal accuracy, making it effective for handling wireless MFL challenges with modal heterogeneity.

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning (MFL) is a distributed framework for training
multimodal models without uploading local multimodal data of clients, thereby
effectively protecting client privacy. However, multimodal data is commonly
heterogeneous across diverse clients, where each client possesses only a subset
of all modalities, renders conventional analysis results and optimization
methods in unimodal federated learning inapplicable. In addition, fixed latency
demand and limited communication bandwidth pose significant challenges for
deploying MFL in wireless scenarios. To optimize the wireless MFL performance
on modal heterogeneity, this paper proposes a joint client scheduling and
bandwidth allocation (JCSBA) algorithm based on a decision-level fusion
architecture with adding a unimodal loss function. Specifically, with the
decision results, the unimodal loss functions are added to both the training
objective and local update loss functions to accelerate multimodal convergence
and improve unimodal performance. To characterize MFL performance, we derive a
closed-form upper bound related to client and modality scheduling and minimize
the derived bound under the latency, energy, and bandwidth constraints through
JCSBA. Experimental results on multimodal datasets demonstrate that the JCSBA
algorithm improves the multimodal accuracy and the unimodal accuracy by 4.06%
and 2.73%, respectively, compared to conventional algorithms.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Asymmetric grid quorum systems allow processes to independently define failure assumptions while ensuring compatibility by design, resolving collaborative trust issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of agreeing on compatible failure assumptions despite individual subjectivity in distributed systems.

Method: The introduction of asymmetric grid quorum systems, where processes independently select quorum systems based on qualitative attributes, ensuring compatibility inherently.

Result: Processes can independently define subjective trust assumptions while maintaining compatibility, enabling collaboration in distributed systems.

Conclusion: Asymmetric grid quorum systems resolve trust compatibility issues in distributed systems while enabling heterogeneous, independent failure assumptions.

Abstract: Quorum systems are a common way to formalize failure assumptions in
distributed systems. Traditionally, these assumptions are shared by all
involved processes. More recently, systems have emerged which allow processes
some freedom in choosing their own, subjective or asymmetric, failure
assumptions. For such a system to work, individual processes' assumptions must
be compatible. However, this leads to a Catch-22-style scenario: How can
processes collaborate to agree on compatible failure assumptions when they have
no compatible failure assumptions to start with?
  We introduce asymmetric grid quorum systems that allow a group of processes
to specify heterogeneous trust assumptions independently of each other and
without coordination. They are based on qualitative attributes describing how
the processes differ. Each process may select a quorum system from this class
that aligns best with its subjective view. The available choices are designed
to be compatible by definition, thereby breaking the cycling dependency.
Asymmetric grid quorum systems have many applications that range from cloud
platforms to blockchain networks.

*Guillermo Toyos-Marfurt,Petr Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the relationship between shared-memory bit capacity and computational rounds in bounded shared-memory algorithms, focusing on asymptotic complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the trade-offs between shared memory bit size and computational rounds is critical for optimizing asynchronous algorithms in distributed systems.

Method: The authors analyze combinatorial structures (protocol complex) and derive conditions for bounded algorithms. They propose an asymptotically optimal bounded full-information algorithm to explore these relationships.

Result: They establish a lower bound of \(\Omega((n!)^{r-1} \cdot 2^{n-b})\) for the round complexity required to implement full-information protocols and create an algorithm that is near-optimal for specific shared-memory models.

Conclusion: Efficiently implementing full-information protocols in bounded shared-memory settings involves significant trade-offs, with their proposed algorithm providing asymptotically optimal or near-optimal solutions for different models.

Abstract: The celebrated asynchronous computability theorem (ACT) characterizes tasks
solvable in the read-write shared-memory model using the unbounded
full-information protocol, where in every round of computation, each process
shares its complete knowledge of the system with the other processes.
Therefore, ACT assumes shared-memory variables of unbounded capacity. It has
been recently shown that boundedvariables can achieve the same computational
power at the expense of extra rounds. However, the exact relationship between
the bit capacity of the shared memory and the number of rounds required in
order to implement one round of the full-information protocol remained unknown.
  In this paper, we focus on the asymptotic round complexity of bounded
iterated shared-memory algorithms that simulate, up to isomorphism, the
unbounded full-information protocol. We relate the round complexity to the
number of processes $n$, the number of iterations of the full information
protocol $r$, and the bit size per shared-memory entry $b$. By analyzing the
corresponding protocol complex, a combinatorial structure representing
reachable states, we derive necessary conditions and present a bounded
full-information algorithm tailored to the bits available $b$ per shared memory
entry. We show that for $n>2$, the round complexity required to implement the
full-information protocol satisfies $\Omega((n!)^{r-1} \cdot 2^{n-b})$. Our
results apply to a range of iterated shared-memory models, from regular
read-write registers to atomic and immediate snapshots. Moreover, our bounded
full-information algorithm is asymptotically optimal for the iterated collect
model and within a linear factor $n$ of optimal for the snapshot-based models.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes using dynamic allocation and pervasive context management for LLMs to reduce execution time by 98.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the demand-supply problem of computational resources for LLMs and reduce reliance on expensive static allocations.

Method: The approach involves pervasive context management, enabling dynamic context reuse on opportunistic computational resources.

Result: The proposed method drastically cuts execution time, achieving a 98.1% reduction when applied to LLM applications.

Conclusion: Dynamic context management and exploiting opportunistic resources offer a viable solution to improve resource efficiency for LLM applications.

Abstract: The widespread growth in LLM developments increasingly demands more
computational power from clusters than what they can supply. Traditional LLM
applications inherently require huge static resource allocations, which force
users to either wait in a long job queue and accept progress delay, or buy
expensive hardware to fulfill their needs and exacerbate the demand-supply
problem. However, not all LLM applications are latency-sensitive and can
instead be executed in a throughput-oriented way. This throughput orientation
allows a dynamic allocation that opportunistically pools available resources
over time, avoiding both the long queue and expensive GPU purchases.
Effectively utilizing opportunistic resources brings numerous challenges
nevertheless. Our solution, pervasive context management, exploits the common
computational context in LLM applications and provides mechanisms and policies
that allow seamless context reuse on opportunistic resources. Our evaluation
shows an LLM application with pervasive context management on opportunistic
resources reduces its execution time by 98.1%.

Method: The authors propose dependence decomposition to factorize the joint distribution into a chain of conditional distributions alongside a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for grid topology synthesis and temporal autoencoding for nodal dynamics.

Result: PowerGrow outperforms previous models in fidelity and diversity, achieves a 98.9% power flow convergence rate, and improves resilience under N-1 contingencies.

Conclusion: PowerGrow effectively addresses the need for generating operationally valid power grid scenarios, demonstrating both computational efficiency and practical applicability in dynamic power systems.

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

### [216] [Scaling Up Data Parallelism in Decentralized Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12213)
*Bing Xie,Junqi Yin,Zhenyu Zhou,Sarp Oral,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores scaling decentralized data parallel training for deep neural networks (DNNs) using a benchmarking framework called DBench to analyze scalability, model accuracy, and parameter tensor variance. The authors propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive training approach, which achieves performance comparable to centralized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized learning, despite theoretical exploration, has not been adopted for production due to issues with stability, scalability, and generality in large-scale DNN training. The paper seeks to illuminate and resolve these issues for practical decentralized methods.

Method: The authors created DBench, a benchmarking framework to compare centralized and decentralized DNN training. They analyzed the impact of training scale and communication graph topology on model accuracy. Using these insights, they proposed Ada, a decentralized adaptive approach that dynamically adjusts communication graphs during training.

Result: The study revealed that decentralized training faces similar scalability and generality issues as centralized training. It also identified key factors‚Äîsuch as communication graph connections and parameter tensor variance‚Äîthat affect model accuracy. Ada demonstrated superior convergence rates and comparable accuracy to centralized methods, even at the scale of 1008 GPUs.

Conclusion: Ada represents a robust decentralized method for large-scale DNN training, addressing key deficiencies in scalability and accuracy, and makes decentralized learning viable for production comparable to centralized approaches.

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

### [217] [MEUV: Achieving Fine-Grained Capability Activation in Large Language Models via Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12221)
*Xin Tong,Zhi Lin,Jingya Wang,Meng Han,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), providing fine-grained control over sensitive topic activation in LLMs while reducing cross-topic leakage by up to 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of blanket safeguards in LLMs that block both malicious requests and legitimate high-stakes applications.

Method: MEUV factorizes refusal directions into topic-aligned vectors using a multi-task learning objective that ensures orthogonality and minimizes interference.

Result: MEUV achieves an attack success rate of 87% while significantly reducing cross-topic leakage compared to baselines, and demonstrates language transferability.

Conclusion: MEUV enables controlled deployment of LLMs in sensitive domains, preserving functionality for legitimate uses while maintaining safety measures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

### [218] [Accelerating Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning in Large-Scale LEO Satellite Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12222)
*Binquan Guo,Junteng Cao,Marie Siew,Binbin Chen,Tony Q. S. Quek,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic scheduling framework to optimize federated learning in large-scale LEO satellite networks, achieving 14.20%-41.48% reduction in training round duration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO satellite systems hold potential for wide-area data exchange to train AI models, but privacy constraints hinder traditional methods; federated learning mitigates this but faces issues like dynamic topology and limited bandwidth.

Method: A discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework was introduced to optimize communication resource allocation for improving federated learning over satellite networks.

Result: The proposed framework reduced the training round time by 14.20% to 41.48%, with higher scalability for larger models and more clients.

Conclusion: Dynamic scheduling significantly boosts the efficiency of federated learning over LEO satellite systems, especially for complex or large-scale deployments.

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

### [219] [Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML): Inducing Causal World Models for Few-Shot Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12387)
*Mohamed Zayaan S*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a framework for achieving robust, sample-efficient learning by leveraging causal reasoning and symbolic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models struggle with generalization and sample efficiency due to their reliance on spurious correlations. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by incorporating causal understanding, a trait essential for human-like intelligence.

Method: The CSML framework is developed with three modules: (1) a perception module for converting raw inputs into symbolic representations, (2) a causal induction module for discovering latent causal structures, and (3) a graph-based reasoning module for making predictions using the causal graph. Meta-learning techniques are applied to generalize across task distributions. A benchmark called CausalWorld is also introduced.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CSML significantly outperforms current meta-learning and neuro-symbolic approaches, particularly in tasks that require causal inference and reasoning. The system shows strong adaptability to novel tasks using minimal examples.

Conclusion: CSML advances the field of meta-learning by incorporating causal discovery and reasoning, addressing key limitations of modern AI models. The results indicate its potential for robust and efficient task generalization.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

### [220] [Traces Propagation: Memory-Efficient and Scalable Forward-Only Learning in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13053)
*Lorenzo Pes,Bojian Yin,Sander Stuijk,Federico Corradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Traces Propagation' (TP), a new local learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that alleviates memory overhead and enhances scalability and efficiency, particularly on embedded devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and memory demands of existing training methods for Spiking Neural Networks (especially Backpropagation Through Time or BPTT), while solving both spatial and temporal credit assignment in a biologically realistic, scalable, and memory-efficient manner.

Method: The researchers developed Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only learning rule that integrates eligibility traces with layer-wise contrastive loss. Unlike previous methods, it avoids the use of auxiliary layer-wise matrices, making it more memory-efficient and scalable.

Result: The TP method achieves state-of-the-art performance among fully local learning rules on benchmark datasets like NMNIST and SHD. It also demonstrates competitive results on larger and more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, with effective scalability on deeper SNN architectures such as VGG-9.

Conclusion: TP provides a biologically-plausible, scalable, and memory-optimized solution for training SNNs. It is particularly suitable for on-device learning tasks, showcasing practical applications like keyword spotting, and marks a step forward in efficient learning at the edge.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing
dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles
underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to
solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for
training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.
However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality
observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and
memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.
Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment
by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit
assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase
memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this
work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,
scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a
layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP
outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On
more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases
competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such
as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully
local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.
Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such
as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way
for efficient learning at the edge.

*Parsa Vatani,Mohamed Elrefaie,Farhad Nazarpour,Faez Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes TripOptimizer, a deep learning framework for aerodynamic shape optimization from vehicle point cloud data, achieving drag coefficient reductions validated with high-fidelity simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD-based aerodynamic optimization consumes significant computational resources, limiting exploration of design possibilities.

Method: TripOptimizer leverages a Variational Autoencoder with a triplane-based implicit neural representation for geometry reconstruction and drag prediction. It is trained on a dataset of vehicle geometries with drag coefficients and modifies specific encoder parameters for optimization.

Result: TripOptimizer achieved reductions in drag coefficients by up to 11.8%, confirmed through high-fidelity CFD simulations. It also effectively handles non-watertight meshes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the aerodynamic optimization process by reducing dependency on resource-intensive CFD simulations, particularly useful in early design stages.

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

*Aiping Zhong,Baike She,Philip E. Par√©*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a PINNs-based MPC framework for epidemic control in susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models, addressing joint real-time estimation of states and parameters using noisy infected states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing MPC designs in epidemic control, which either focus on learning parameters or states but fail to jointly estimate both in dynamic scenarios.

Method: The authors introduced novel PINNs algorithms, including MPC-PINNs, MPC-LS-PINNs, MPC-SI-PINNs, and MPC-S-PINNs, integrated into an MPC framework to simultaneously estimate states and parameters using noisy data.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed framework effectively reconstructs epidemic states and parameters while optimizing control strategies under different conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide a robust and integrated solution for epidemic control, significantly improving state reconstruction and parameter estimation in challenging settings.

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are
learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In
this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

*Mohammad Nooraiepour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bayesian Parametric Matrix Models (B-PMMs) for scientific machine learning, extending traditional parametric matrix models to include uncertainty quantification while preserving spectral structure and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spectral learning approaches lack uncertainty quantification, limiting their application in safety-critical systems. Standard Bayesian methods fail for quantifying uncertainty in eigenvalue problems, necessitating a new solution.

Method: The authors propose B-PMMs, incorporating adaptive spectral decomposition, manifold-aware variational inference, and finite-sample calibration to address geometric constraints and eigenvalue uncertainty propagation.

Result: Experimental evaluation showcases B-PMMs' ability to provide exceptional uncertainty calibration with an ECE below 0.05 across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500, maintaining robustness under spectral ill-conditioning.

Conclusion: B-PMMs deliver reliable uncertainty estimates for spectral problems, bridging the gap between safety-critical applications and Bayesian scientific machine learning, paving the way for advancements in Bayesian spectral methods.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal prediction settings, focusing on mental healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data heterogeneity and varying task interactions in real-world settings, such as personalized psychotherapy, where data modalities and outcomes are interdependent.

Method: The model dynamically routes input data through modality-specific pathways and task-sharing strategies, using raw and fused representations along with task-specific heads. It employs end-to-end training.

Result: The approach outperformed fixed multitask and single-task baselines in both synthetic and real-world psychotherapy datasets, delivering valuable insights into modality relevance and task structure.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves adaptive information processing in healthcare by accounting for data differences and task relations, enabling more precise and cost-effective mental health interventions.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal framework to improve the reliability of large language models by offering information-lift certificates under selective classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models frequently produce plausible but incorrect outputs, and existing methods like HallBayes lack formal guarantees, necessitating a rigorous theoretical framework.

Method: The paper develops a PAC-Bayes sub-gamma analysis, derives skeleton sensitivity theorems, offers assumptions about failure modes, and presents a variational approach for skeleton construction.

Result: The approach empirically validated its assumptions across six datasets and multiple model families, achieving a 12‚Äì15% reduction in abstention at the same risk while keeping runtime overhead below 20%, further reduced through batching.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust framework to enhance model reliability, bridging gaps in existing heuristics while improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models often produce plausible but incorrect outputs. Existing
heuristics such as HallBayes lack formal guarantees. We develop the first
comprehensive theory of \emph{information-lift certificates} under selective
classification. Our contributions are: (i) a PAC-Bayes \emph{sub-gamma}
analysis extending beyond standard Bernstein bounds; (ii) explicit skeleton
sensitivity theorems quantifying robustness to misspecification; (iii)
failure-mode guarantees under assumption violations; and (iv) a principled
variational method for skeleton construction. Across six datasets and multiple
model families, we validate assumptions empirically, reduce abstention by
12--15\% at the same risk, and maintain runtime overhead below 20\% (further
reduced via batching).

TL;DR: The paper investigates the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and QLoRA for large language models on low-cost consumer GPUs with strict VRAM constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in understanding the feasibility and efficiency of fine-tuning LLMs on consumer-grade GPUs that have limited VRAM capacity.

Method: A profiling study was conducted using fine-tuning configurations on the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on an NVIDIA RTX 4060 with variations in batch size, sequence length, optimizer choice, and precision.

Result: PagedAdamW optimizers improve throughput by up to 25%, bf16 precision is less efficient than fp16, and sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens are achievable within 8 GB VRAM constraints using LoRA/QLoRA.

Conclusion: The study provides practical benchmarks and guidelines for fine-tuning LLMs on modest hardware resources, offering insights valuable to resource-limited researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

*Benjamin Burns,Yuan Xue,Douglas W. Scharre,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PerM-MoE, a sparse mixture-of-experts model designed to predict Alzheimer's disease progression under missing neuroimaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models struggle with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease progression prediction when many imaging modalities are missing in clinical scenarios.

Method: The proposed PerM-MoE uses independent routers for each neuroimaging modality instead of a single router, enhancing flexibility under missing modalities.

Result: PerM-MoE outperformed Flex-MoE and unimodal models in predicting cognitive decline across varying levels of modality missingness.

Conclusion: PerM-MoE shows improved adaptability and effectiveness in handling missing neuroimaging modalities, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications in AD progression prediction.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

*Hangzhan Jin,Sitao Luan,Sicheng Lyu,Guillaume Rabusseau,Reihaneh Rabbany,Doina Precup,Mohammad Hamdaqa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mechanisms behind the two-stage fine-tuning paradigm (SFT then RL) for post-training LLMs, finding that RL primarily restores OOD performance lost during SFT rather than improving it fundamentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the roles of SFT and RL in enhancing LLM reasoning performance, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of forgetting and restoration stages.

Method: The study analyzes SFT and RL through empirical observations, SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manual editing of singular vectors, and evaluation of their effects on OOD performance.

Result: Key findings include OOD performance peaking and then declining during SFT, RL restoring lost OOD reasoning capabilities, and the mechanism being strongly tied to rotations of singular vectors rather than singular value changes.

Conclusion: The synergy between SFT and RL is explained via the rotation of singular vectors, re-positioning the understanding of how model capacity evolves during fine-tuning stages for OOD reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

### [229] [Neural Diffeomorphic-Neural Operator for Residual Stress-Induced Deformation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12237)
*Changqing Liu,Kaining Dai,Zhiwei Zhao,Tianyi Wu,Yingguang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, NDNO, that utilizes neural operators and diffeomorphic embeddings for efficient deformation prediction in structural components under residual stress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting machining deformations accurately in structural components is crucial for maintaining precision and reliability, with challenges arising due to the influence of residual stress on varying geometries.

Method: A framework using Neural Diffeomorphic-Neural Operators (NDNO) is proposed, combining diffeomorphic neural networks to map complex geometries to a reference domain and neural operators for efficient deformation analysis.

Result: The method showed high accuracy and efficiency in predicting deformation fields for components with diverse geometry types, including multidirectional deformations.

Conclusion: NDNO provides a computationally efficient and reliable solution for analyzing and predicting machining deformations across a variety of structural geometries, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

*Songlin Zhou,Tao Zhou,Xin Li,Stephen Shing-Toung Yau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper leverages an improved data mining method to identify clinical markers aiding the preoperative diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Follicular thyroid cancer is challenging to diagnose preoperatively due to the lack of distinctive ultrasound markers, and there is limited clinical research addressing these challenges.

Method: The study conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 2010-2023, using an enhanced version of association rule mining incorporated with SHAP interpretability metrics to explore malignant indicators.

Result: Out of 1673 nodes analyzed, 259 were malignant. Findings highlighted both common and novel malignant indicators, including nodule-in-nodule and trabecular patterns, low TSH scores, and associations with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Conclusion: Considering multiple clinical indications improves diagnostic accuracy for follicular thyroid cancer, and the findings can guide clinicians in preoperative evaluations.

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

*Sam McCallum,Kamran Arora,James Foster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) define the model's output as a fixed point of a function but face challenges in gradient calculation, requiring regularization. Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) solve this by enabling exact gradient calculation, enhancing stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the unstable training dynamics and approximate gradient calculation in Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs).

Method: Introduced Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs), which enable exact gradient calculation and reduce the need for regularization and multiple function evaluations.

Result: RevDEQs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as language modeling and image classification, outperforming both implicit and explicit models.

Conclusion: RevDEQs provide a significant improvement over DEQs by resolving gradient calculation issues and achieving superior task performance without the drawbacks of instability or excessive computations.

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model
where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned
function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth)
models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that
is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is
approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires
regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce
Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient
calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We
show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling
and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'InJecteD,' a framework to interpret and analyze Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) during 2D point cloud generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model transparency and enable effective debugging of DDPMs, fostering better human-AI collaboration.

Method: InJecteD analyzes sample trajectories during DDPM denoising, quantifying properties like displacement and drift field dynamics through metrics such as Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity.

Result: Distinct denoising phases (noise exploration, shape formation, refinement) were identified, with dataset-specific behaviors. Fourier-based embeddings enhanced trajectory stability and reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework aids in understanding DDPM behavior, enabling model improvement through precise trajectory analysis and embedding choices.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during
the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to
three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a
simplified DDPM architecture with customizable input and time embeddings. Our
approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity,
clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as
Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with
dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos
complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying
embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings
improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality

### [233] [Causal Discovery via Quantile Partial Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12981)
*Yikang Chen,Xingzhe Sun,Dehui Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) as a statistic for determining causal relationships, focusing on its integration into causal discovery. Both bivariate and multivariate causal directions are addressed through observational distributions, avoiding dependency on traditional assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the causal inference framework by introducing a statistical measure (QPE) that leverages asymmetry in observational distributions without reliance on traditional assumptions such as noise models or the Markov condition.

Method: The theory and practical application of QPE are explored, with basis function tests used to distinguish causal directions in bivariate setups and Fisher Information applied to identify causal order in multivariate setups.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QPE in bivariate causal discovery datasets and validate its feasibility in multivariate causal discovery via Fisher Information on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: QPE offers a robust and assumption-light approach to causal inference, advancing the understanding of causality for both bivariate and multivariate contexts through statistical measures derived directly from observational distributions.

Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional
quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels.
Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie
in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their
observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results
based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise,
etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this
parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even
the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape
characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function
tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is
empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate
causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the
close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher
Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order
when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the
feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple
synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges faced by resource-constrained IoT devices in executing federated learning, such as limited energy, unreliable communication, and impractical assumptions of infinite blocklength transmission.

Method: The framework combines finite blocklength transmission, model quantization, error-aware aggregation, and uplink transmission power optimization to enhance energy efficiency and communication reliability.

Result: Simulation results show that the proposed framework reduces energy consumption by up to 75% compared to standard FL models, while maintaining robust model accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an efficient and practical solution for implementing federated learning in real-world resource-constrained IoT environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper theoretical explores a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) variant, proving its ability to avoid collapsing representations in deterministic MDPs when trained with an auxiliary regression head.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the behavior of JEPA in visual representation learning and model-based RL settings.

Method: The study involves theoretical proofs (No Unhealthy Representation Collapse theorem) and controlled experiments focusing on deterministic MDPs and auxiliary task integration.

Result: Training JEPA with a jointly-taught auxiliary regression head ensures distinct latent representations for non-equivalent observations and yields richer representations compared to separate training.

Conclusion: Linking auxiliary tasks and transition dynamics enhances the effectiveness of JEPA encoders in representation learning.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

*Mihir Tare,Clemens Rattasits,Yiming Wu,Euan Wielewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper applies GraphSAGE, an inductive graph neural network framework, to banking transaction networks for scalable and interpretable fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial institutions face difficulties analyzing dynamic and complex transactional networks using traditional graph embedding methods.

Method: The authors constructed a transaction network from anonymized customer and merchant transactions, trained a GraphSAGE model to create node embeddings, and evaluated them in classification tasks.

Result: The GraphSAGE embeddings produced interpretable clusters, improved money mule detection accuracy, and demonstrated scalability and inductive capability for large banking networks.

Conclusion: The study provides a roadmap for using graph machine learning in the financial sector for enhanced fraud detection and other actionable insights from transactional data.

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

*Zhongwen Xu,Zihan Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), a method to improve policy-gradient optimization for large language models, addressing flaws in conventional techniques like high variance and scalability barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome flaws in prevailing policy-gradient optimization methods like GRPO, which suffer from high variance, degenerate groups erasing learning signals, and poor scalability.

Method: The authors introduced SPO, replacing local baselines with a KL-adaptive value tracker and globally normalized advantages for stable learning signals, while removing group-based constraints.

Result: Experiments on hard math benchmarks show SPO outperforms GRPO with smoother convergence, higher accuracy, and significant improvements in benchmarks like BRUMO 25 (+7.3 pp) and AIME 25 (+4.4 pp).

Conclusion: SPO's principled approach challenges the trend of adding complexity to reinforcement learning algorithms in LLMs, offering a scalable and efficient solution driven by foundational improvements.

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer new theoretical explanations for the scaled-dot-product and softmax functions used in transformer architectures by modeling their components through statistical approaches.

Method: Defines sequences of Gaussian distributions where variance and mean are determined by time steps and vectors (key, value, and query). It explores maximum entropy methods for deriving feature functions.

Result: Provides alternative theoretical and statistical modeling approaches for understanding transformer mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed Gaussian and entropy-based analyses enrich theoretical understanding of foundational components in transformer architectures.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the

offer a novel approach by combining the strengths of generative models with
quantum machine learning techniques. We implement a QGAN model tailored for

### [243] [C3DE: Causal-Aware Collaborative Neural Controlled Differential Equation for Long-Term Urban Crowd Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12289)
*Yuting Liu,Qiang Zhou,Hanzhe Li,Chenqi Gong,Jingjing Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Causal-aware Collaborative Neural CDE (C3DE) model to address long-term urban crowd flow prediction issues, improving accuracy by handling spurious causality and asynchronous dynamics using counterfactual methods and dual-path NCDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction faces challenges like cumulative sampling errors, asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distributions, and spurious causality, all of which limit prediction accuracy.

Method: This study introduces the C3DE model with a dual-path NCDE to capture multi-timescale signals of crowd flow and POIs, a dynamic correction mechanism using counterfactual causal estimators, and a fused-signals predictor for long-term predictions.

Result: Experimental results across three real-world datasets show that C3DE significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in cities with high flow fluctuations.

Conclusion: C3DE effectively addresses challenges in long-term crowd flow prediction by leveraging causal awareness and dynamic modeling of asynchronous signals, setting a new benchmark in prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI

### [244] [Spontaneous Kolmogorov-Arnold Geometry in Shallow MLPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12326)
*Michael Freedman,Michael Mulligan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) geometry naturally emerges in single hidden layer neural networks during training, focusing on the Jacobian's statistical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks naturally optimize input data for downstream tasks and investigate if KA geometry helps accelerate learning by adjusting network hyperparameters.

Method: The authors study the emergent KA geometry in single hidden layer networks by analyzing the statistical properties of the Jacobian's exterior powers, zero row counts, and other minor-related metrics.

Result: KA geometry was observed to emerge in conventional neural networks during training, and its occurrence is linked to model complexity and hyperparameter settings.

Conclusion: The paper offers insight into the organic development of KA geometry in shallow networks and identifies conditions under which this behavior occurs, potentially guiding optimal hyperparameter choices.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to
prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough
about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather
watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

*Xianchen Liu,Tianhui Zhang,Xinyu Zhang,Lingmin Hou,Zhen Guo,Yuanhao Tian,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper combines LSTM networks with PSO to optimize supermarket pricing and replenishment strategies, aiming to maximize profitability and reduce food waste.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges supermarkets face in optimizing pricing and inventory management for perishable goods, while improving profitability and sustainability.

Method: The methodology combines an LSTM model (with attention mechanism for predicting sales trends and spoilage rates) and a PSO algorithm for optimizing pricing and replenishment strategies.

Result: The framework successfully maximizes profits, reduces food waste, and enhances interpretability in pricing and inventory decision-making.

Conclusion: This approach bridges the gap between predictive modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for fresh food retail and other industries managing perishable goods.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

*Arth Sojitra,Mrigank Dhingra,Omer San*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fourier-embedded trunk networks within DeepONets to enhance their performance in learning nonlinear operators for PDEs and reports significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DeepONets using fully connected trunk networks struggle to capture the complex spatial structures inherent in PDEs, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: The authors incorporate Fourier-embedded trunk networks into DeepONets, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to enhance spatial representation.

Result: The Fourier-embedded DeepONet (FEDONet) outperforms traditional DeepONets across a variety of PDE-driven datasets, achieving 2-3x average relative L2 accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: The study validates the use of Fourier embeddings as a robust enhancement for neural operator learning, demonstrating broad applicability and improved performance for PDE surrogate modeling.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

*Liam Ressel,Hamza A. A. Gardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates dimensionality reduction techniques for classifying salaries based on tabular data and proposes the Partitioned-LDA method to enhance word embedding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address classification challenges posed by high-dimensional word embeddings in tabular data and limited training samples using dimensionality reduction techniques.

Method: The paper examines PCA and LDA, proposes Partitioned-LDA with blockwise analysis, and integrates shrinkage to mitigate covariance estimation errors.

Result: Partitioned-LDA achieves superior performance over regular LDA and performs well with shrinkage, securing high leaderboard rankings in the competition.

Conclusion: Partitioned-LDA combined with regularization boosts classification accuracy, offering an effective solution for enhancing word embeddings in tabular data scenarios with sparse samples.

Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

*Hong Sun,Joshua A. Vita,Amit Samanta,Vincenzo Lordi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEAGraph, an unsupervised tool to analyze atomic datasets, addressing sampling bias in dataset generation for force fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constructing unbiased and diverse datasets for training force fields is challenging as common techniques often oversample specific energy regions and struggle with high-dimensional atomic descriptors.

Method: The proposed MEAGraph model employs multiple linear kernel transformations and attention-based message passing for unsupervised representation learning and dataset pruning without labels.

Result: MEAGraph demonstrates efficiency in grouping similar atomic environments in niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets, facilitating straightforward pruning methods to mitigate sampling bias.

Conclusion: MEAGraph offers a novel clustering and representation learning tool for analyzing atomic datasets, proving useful for data analysis, outlier detection, and optimization without significant information loss.

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a federated learning framework for smart farming in Minnesota to enable secure crop disease detection without compromising data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers are hesitant to share operational data due to privacy concerns, necessitating a solution for secure, data-driven disease detection methods.

Method: The framework relies on local data collection, local deep learning algorithms, transfer learning, and central aggregation to achieve scalable disease detection with privacy preservation.

Result: The proposed methodology aims to enhance disease detection accuracy, ensure data privacy, improve generalization across scenarios, and reduce communication and training costs.

Conclusion: The research sets the stage for revolutionizing smart farming through federated learning for secure crop monitoring, addressing privacy concerns and operational problems effectively.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

*Konstantinos Vasili,Zachery T. Dahm,Stylianos Chatzidakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study proposes an unsupervised LSTM autoencoder framework with dual attention for anomaly detection and localization in a nuclear reactor system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accurate diagnostic tools capable of detecting and localizing anomalies for advanced reactor operation systems.

Method: An unsupervised LSTM autoencoder with dual attention mechanisms in both feature and temporal dimensions was used for anomaly detection and localization, evaluated using real-world datasets from the PUR-1 research reactor.

Result: The attention mechanisms successfully detected radiation sensors with abnormal patterns and localized anomalies to specific timesteps, demonstrating effective scalability to complex real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework offers a unified solution to identify affected sensors and anomaly durations, improving the safety and interpretability of anomaly detection in safety-critical nuclear systems.

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for generating realistic automotive time series data and improving data quality through hybrid approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small time series datasets with corrupted samples make it challenging for training deep learning models effectively, necessitating robust synthetic data generation and imputation techniques.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid generative approach that merges autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques, with enhancements to DDPM architectures, and introduces metrics for evaluating the quality of generated samples.

Result: The proposed hybrid model outperforms training data in physical correctness, generates plausible driving behaviors, and successfully imputes corrupted regions in the dataset to enhance data quality.

Conclusion: DDPMs, especially with the proposed hybrid approach and metrics, can effectively generate realistic automotive time series data and improve the quality of existing datasets.

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make 3D printing more accessible to a broader audience by addressing common issues that deter less experienced users, particularly problems arising from complex geometries.

Method: The paper proposes training an AI model to detect problematic features in 3D models before printing, complementing existing slicing software checks.

Result: The model detects common issues in 3D models, enhancing printing reliability for users with less expertise.

Conclusion: Using AI enables detection of hard-to-print features in 3D models, reducing print failures and supporting the growing accessibility of 3D printing technology.

Abstract: 3D printing has long been a technology for industry professionals and
enthusiasts willing to tinker or even build their own machines. This stands in
stark contrast to today's market, where recent developments have prioritized
ease of use to attract a broader audience. Slicing software nowadays has a few
ways to sanity check the input file as well as the output gcode. Our approach
introduces a novel layer of support by training an AI model to detect common
issues in 3D models. The goal is to assist less experienced users by
identifying features that are likely to cause print failures due to difficult
to print geometries before printing even begins.

*Qingchun Gong,Robert Bogdan Staszewski,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASGE, a novel Forward-Forward-based algorithm for training CNNs, aiming to eliminate backpropagation while achieving competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Forward-Forward approaches face problems like limited representation capacity and poor scalability due to exploding channel dimensionality.

Method: The proposed ASGE leverages spatially-aware goodness representations to compute layer-wise supervision, decoupling classification complexity from channel dimensionality.

Result: ASGE achieves high performance on benchmarks such as 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on FashionMNIST, and successful application to ImageNet with Top-1 accuracy of 26.21%.

Conclusion: ASGE effectively addresses channel dimensionality challenges, narrows the performance gap with backpropagation-trained models, and paves the way for scalable CNN training without backpropagation.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer,
enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely eliminating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

### [254] [Surrogate Representation Inference for Noisy Text and Image Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12416)
*Kentaro Nakamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Surrogate Representation Inference (SRI), a neural network-based approach that reduces bias and standard errors in data analysis by learning low-dimensional representations of unstructured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of current methods, which often produce large standard errors and depend on error-free human annotations, motivated the introduction of a more efficient and robust analytical framework.

Method: The paper proposes SRI, a neural network designed to learn low-dimensional representations of unstructured data, leveraging a surrogate assumption and correcting for non-differential measurement errors in human annotations.

Result: Simulation studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard errors by over 50% and maintains valid inference even when human annotations are prone to errors.

Conclusion: SRI significantly improves inference efficiency and robustness in text-as-outcome settings and offers a viable solution for handling noisy human annotations in machine learning analysis.

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

### [255] [On the Regularity and Fairness of Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12457)
*Xiaoyi Wu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new algorithm for the combinatorial multi-armed bandit model that addresses fairness, reward regularity, and cumulative rewards in wireless networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by two key challenges in wireless networks: ensuring fairness (minimum average reward for each arm) and maintaining reward regularity (how often each arm receives a reward).

Method: A parameterized learning algorithm is proposed that combines virtual queue-lengths, Time-Since-Last-Reward metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound estimates to balance fairness, regularity, and exploration-exploitation.

Result: The algorithm ensures zero cumulative fairness violations, optimizes reward regularity, and demonstrates strong cumulative regret performance both theoretically and via simulations on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study confirms that the proposed algorithm effectively achieves fairness, regularity, and cumulative reward maximization, addressing critical challenges in wireless networks.

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

*Sriram Nagaraj,Vishakh Hari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to nonsmooth models and functions by introducing the Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard NTK theory can't handle non-smooth target functions or models with non-differentiable behaviors.

Method: Proposes nonlocal gradients as a substitute for traditional local gradients in the NTK framework.

Result: Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel.

Conclusion: The NNTK framework broadens NTK's applicability to nonsmooth functions, stochastic estimators, and diverse model families.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.
We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and provide insights on the performance differences, advantages, and limitations of BEM and PINNs under the same conditions for solving wave propagation problems.

Method: The Helmholtz equation is solved using both BEM and PINNs in a comparative setup. PINNs are optimized through hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics include accuracy, solution time, and generalization capabilities.

Result: PINNs achieve faster evaluation but require significantly longer training times compared to BEM. While PINNs excel in certain metrics, their generalization outside the training domain shows substantially increased errors compared to the consistently accurate BEM.

Conclusion: The paper provides critical insights into the trade-offs between BEM and PINNs, aiding researchers in selecting the appropriate method for varying wave propagation problems.

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and scalability challenges in solving SDGs for graph-structured multi-agent systems by leveraging sparsity and topology.

Method: The NTM architecture incorporates fixed, non-trainable components aligned with graph topology into feedforward neural networks, reducing trainable parameters and enhancing stability and interpretability.

Result: NTM achieves comparable performance to fully trainable neural networks in solving SDGs, with improved computational efficiency; results verified on three SDGs with various graph structures.

Conclusion: The NTM architecture is effective for graph-structured SDGs, showing promise in scalability, expressivity, and robustness with reduced computational demands.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable

*Alessandro Crimi,Andrea Brovelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares foundation models to traditional methods for forecasting brain signals and analyzing causality using fMRI data, revealing strong zero-shot capabilities and improved precision in causal detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding brain activity and causal interactions aids in exploring cognitive mechanisms and diseases, and the study investigates how foundation models perform in forecasting and causality compared to classical methods.

Method: The researchers compared a foundation model for brain signal predictions and causality inference against traditional Granger causality methods using fMRI data. They validated with synthetic causal models and measured forecasting accuracy in zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios.

Result: The foundation model demonstrated competitive forecasting accuracy, such as 0.55 error in controls and 0.27 error in patients, while offering improved precision in detecting causal interactions compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: Foundation models provide robust zero-shot forecasting, versatility, and improved causal interaction detection, showing promise for neuroscience applications like brain signal analysis.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal
discovery in time-series data.

*Yifan Lan,Yuanpu Cao,Weitong Zhang,Lu Lin,Jinghui Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new safety risk in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): their responses can be manipulated via optimized images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the safety vulnerabilities posed by MLLMs in terms of response manipulation via external media.

Method: The authors propose Preference Hijacking (Phi), a method that manipulates MLLM response preferences using specially crafted images during inference, without altering the model.

Result: Experimental results show successful manipulation of MLLM outputs across various tasks using the proposed attack mechanism.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical safety risk in MLLMs, emphasizing the need for safeguarding against preference hijacking attacks.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

*Ruizhong Qiu,Ting-Wei Li,Gaotang Li,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAPHITE, a novel framework that transforms graphs to improve performance on heterophilic graphs, achieving better results than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Networks perform poorly on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often have dissimilar features or labels.

Method: GRAPHITE increases graph homophily by transforming the graph structure through adding feature-based nodes, enabling more effective message passing.

Result: GRAPHITE significantly boosts homophily in heterophilic graphs with minimal graph size increase and surpasses state-of-the-art models on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: GRAPHITE is a promising approach for handling heterophilic graphs, offering superior performance while maintaining effectiveness on homophilic graphs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

*Wei Li,Zheze Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an anomaly detection approach for time series using cross-modal deep metric learning, outperforming in sensitivity, speed, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series anomaly detection suffers from low sensitivity and high time consumption, necessitating a more efficient and robust approach.

Method: Introduced a cross-modal deep metric learning model with feature clustering, vMF distribution, and principal component direction analysis for robust anomaly detection.

Result: Demonstrated high classification accuracy, sensitivity, detection speed, and robustness in identifying anomalies in time series data.

Conclusion: Cross-modal deep metric learning effectively enhances time series anomaly detection in terms of both efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces implicit Clustering Distillation (iCD), a novel method for transferring structural knowledge from logits to improve knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logit-based Knowledge Distillation lacks interpretability in decision-making, which limits its effectiveness despite its simplicity.

Method: The proposed iCD technique uses Gram matrices over localized logit representations to mine and transfer structural semantic knowledge, avoiding the need for ground-truth labels or feature alignment.

Result: iCD demonstrates significant performance gains in fine-grained classification tasks, with improvements up to +5.08% over baseline methods across various teacher-student architectures.

Conclusion: iCD effectively enhances interpretability and performance in knowledge distillation, making it especially useful for fine-grained classification tasks.

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

*Tim Bary,Beno√Æt Macq,Louis Petit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free framework for hybrid human-AI decision-making using conformal prediction, outperforming existing deferral methods while reducing expert workload significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems often fail to make reliable predictions for all inputs, necessitating human-AI collaboration methods that are scalable and adaptable without requiring extensive retraining.

Method: The authors leverage conformal prediction to generate label-specific uncertainty and use a segregativity criterion for expert selection based on their ability to distinguish plausible remaining labels.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show improved accuracy (~99.4%-99.6%) and significant reduction in expert workload by up to 11x. The method also demonstrates robustness against poor expert performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a retraining-free, robust, and scalable alternative to Learning to Defer (L2D) models for hybrid human-AI decision-making applications.

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: The paper studies training data attribution (TDA) methods under access and resource limitations, proposing approaches like proxy models and demonstrating their effectiveness even without prior training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TDA methods face challenges in real-world applications due to their reliance on full model access and high computational requirements.

Method: The study systematically explores TDA methods by leveraging proxy models and evaluating attribution scores obtained without prior training on target datasets.

Result: The paper demonstrates that TDA methods are feasible and informative even with limited access and computational resources.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical strategies for deploying TDA effectively in constrained environments, enhancing its applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

TL;DR: MICE, a foundation model, integrates diverse multimodal data for improved pan-cancer prognosis prediction and surpasses current multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting poorly generalizable representations from multimodal data for understanding the tumor microenvironment.

Method: Developed MICE model using diverse functional experts with integration of contrastive and supervised learning to process multimodal data from pathology, clinical, and genomics sources.

Result: MICE achieved superior generalizability and performance with significant improvements in C-index compared to state-of-the-art methods across internal and independent cohorts.

Conclusion: MICE sets a scalable and efficient foundation for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction, paving the way for personalized cancer therapies and better treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and
improve treatment outcomes.

*Haozhi Shi,Weiying Xie,Hangyu Ye,Daixun Li,Jitao Ma,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedFD, a frequency-domain-aware federated learning method that reduces communication costs by filtering redundant high-frequency information while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning has challenges in managing redundant information and noise, which increases communication costs.

Method: FedFD uses discrete cosine transform to filter high-frequency components via a binary mask, preserving low-energy components for optimal frequency-domain distribution alignment.

Result: FedFD significantly reduces communication costs and improves performance on multiple datasets, achieving up to a 37.78% communication cost reduction and 10.88% performance improvement on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The proposed FedFD method is effective in reducing communication costs while improving task performance in federated learning frameworks by optimizing data representation in the frequency domain.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

### [268] [Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12650)
*Chan Sik Han,Keon Myung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRep proposes a novel anomaly detection method using intermediate representations of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) and outperforms existing approaches in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods primarily utilize final layer representations of TSFMs, which may limit their effectiveness. The paper aims to explore intermediate representations for enhanced detection performance.

Method: TimeRep computes anomaly scores based on distances between intermediate representations of pre-trained TSFMs. It selects informative layers and token positions, builds a reference collection using training data, and adapts dynamically to concept drift during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive reveal that TimeRep consistently achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, including deep learning and non-deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: Leveraging intermediate layer representations of TSFMs offers substantial improvements in anomaly detection, even under concept drift scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

*Yiyang Li,Yonghuang Wu,Ying Luo,Liangtai Sun,Zishu Qin,Lin Qiu,Xuezhi Cao,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses evaluation instability in large language models (LLMs) caused by random factors, proposing instance-level randomization (ILR) to reduce variance and improve fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs often rely on fixed random factors, leading to unstable scores and unfair comparisons between models.

Method: The authors propose instance-level randomization (ILR), which randomizes evaluation factors for every instance, averages multiple experiments, and reduces reliance on fixed settings.

Result: ILR reduces variance and unfair comparisons while maintaining robustness, achieving this with less than half the computational cost of prior methods.

Conclusion: ILR is an effective method for stabilizing LLM evaluations, offering improved fairness and reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates scaling laws for neural quantum states (NQS) using transformer-based models, focusing on performance metrics like error and V-score in quantum chemistry. Results show scalability characteristics distinct from language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how NQS, which increasingly use components from large language models (LLMs), scale with resources like data and computational power. This helps optimize their scalability and performance in quantum chemistry problems.

Method: The authors analyze transformer-based NQS performance in second-quantized quantum chemistry using loss metrics like absolute error and V-score. They conduct compute-constrained optimizations of performance curves.

Result: Results reveal that scaling behaviors in NQS models vary significantly depending on loss metrics and ansatz, differing from the linear relationships found in language models.

Conclusion: NQS scaling laws present unique characteristics that challenge assumptions from LLM studies, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in quantum state modeling.

Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM)
performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of
computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS)
has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS
scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal
performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify
scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and
V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in
second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous
compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find
that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent
on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear
relationship found for language models.

*Eric Cheng,Jie Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZTree, a novel decision tree framework using hypothesis testing for splitting, simplifying complexity control while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees rely on impurity-based splitting methods, which may lack statistical rigor and flexibility. The authors aim to introduce a more statistically grounded approach for decision tree learning.

Method: ZTree employs hypothesis testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests) for subgroup analysis during tree splitting and uses cross-validation for determining stopping criteria, thereby simplifying tree complexity management.

Result: Empirical evaluation across five large UCI datasets shows ZTree produces strong performance, especially in low data environments, while growing simpler trees compared to CART.

Conclusion: ZTree provides an efficient and statistically principled alternative to traditional decision trees, improving interpretability, flexibility, and performance without sacrificing complexity control.

Abstract: Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued
for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and
regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that
replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically
principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis
testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a
candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the
complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach
to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping
criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold
(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of
the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned
using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply
removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter
tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a
p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into
our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical
evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree
consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.
Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing
performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to
traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a
cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Soft Graph Transformer (SGT) is proposed as a novel architecture for MIMO detection, integrating graph-aware attention and supporting soft-input embeddings to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection has optimal accuracy but is computationally expensive for practical applications. Conventional message-passing algorithms rely on idealized assumptions, and prior Transformer-based detectors fail to consider MIMO factor graph structures or support decoder-side updates.

Method: SGT introduces a graph-aware attention mechanism, integrates message passing, and supports decoder-informed updates using soft-input embeddings.

Result: As a standalone MIMO detector, SGT significantly closes the performance gap with ML detection, outperforming previous Transformer-based approaches.

Conclusion: SGT improves MIMO detection performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating effective integration of factor graph-aware mechanisms and support for iterative detection-decoding.

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural
architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity
renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing
algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics
and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical
implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to
incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side
soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability
in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT
integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and
supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design
enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational
efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and
surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.

*Yiyuan Yang,Guodong Long,Qinghua Lu,Liming Zhu,Jing Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning foundation models, addressing the challenges of limited data and balancing personalization versus federation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning foundation models for small user groups or specialized scenarios is challenging due to limited data compared to pre-training datasets, making personalization versus federation a sensitive issue.

Method: The framework involves personalized fine-tuning at the client level using private data and personalized aggregation at the server level, grouping similar users based on client-specific task vectors. This mitigates impact from clients with conflicting interests or non-IID data.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in achieving personalized federated fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The bi-level personalization method successfully addresses the trade-off between client-level personalization and server-level federation, enhancing federated fine-tuning for diverse and specialized scenarios.

Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune
pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to
fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized
scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale
data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between
personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we
proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on
foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the
client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized
aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific
task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level
fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise
personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or
interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark
datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called NORA, aimed at improving early Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) detection using routinely collected non-renal clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease is challenging due to the unavailability of renal biomarkers in outpatient settings, prompting research into alternative predictive variables.

Method: The study proposes NORA, a Nephrology-Oriented Representation Learning method that uses supervised contrastive learning and a Random Forest classifier to process tabular EHR data for CKD classification.

Result: NORA achieved improved class separability and enhanced classification performance, particularly boosting the F1-score for early-stage CKD detection. The model showed generalizability across different patient datasets.

Conclusion: The NORA method provides an effective approach for CKD classification and risk stratification, making strides in early-stage detection using non-renal clinical variables.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its
early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where
laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we
investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical
variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid
conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented
Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive
learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives
discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then
used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR
dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that
NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance,
particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we
assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.

### [276] [Unbiased Online Curvature Approximation for Regularized Graph Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12727)
*Jie Yin,Ke Sun,Han Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses graph continual learning (GCL) and proposes a new online curvature approximation method to prevent catastrophic forgetting, achieving improvements in performance across graph datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-incremental and replay-free GCL tasks often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and current regularization methods like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) have significant limitations that need to be addressed.

Method: This paper introduces an unbiased online curvature approximation of the full Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) that estimates the regularization term in an online manner without explicit computation or storage of FIM.

Result: Experiments on three graph datasets show that the proposed method greatly surpasses existing regularization-based techniques in terms of stability and plasticity.

Conclusion: The new method provides a better balance between retaining old knowledge and learning new tasks, making it more effective in the GCL setting compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

*Rishab Parthasarathy,Achintya Bhowmik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI framework combining machine learning and pathway analysis to predict cancer progression and treatments efficiently, achieving 60% accuracy without relying on wet lab experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cancer remains a leading cause of death, and manual pathway analysis is time-consuming. This paper aims to use AI to streamline cancer severity prediction and treatment recommendations.

Method: Mutation sequences from the TCGA database are preprocessed using a novel algorithm, with data fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for severity prediction. Predictions and drug-target databases are combined to project mutations and suggest treatments.

Result: The framework achieved approximately 60% accuracy in cancer severity prediction, with effective isolation of key mutations. Heatmaps demonstrated important mutations, aligning with existing research.

Conclusion: This is the first cost-effective, end-to-end AI-based framework to predict cancer stages and suggest treatments, reducing dependence on wet lab data.

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

### [278] [A Graph Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Topological Patterns in Transactional Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12730)
*Francesco Zola,Jon Ander Medina,Andrea Venturi,Amaia Gil,Raul Orduna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method combining graph machine learning and network analysis for detecting complex financial crime patterns within transactional graphs, overcoming the limitations of traditional datasets and rule-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional financial crime detection systems using rule-based methods are inadequate for dealing with complex, evolving, and coordinated financial crime tactics. A need exists for approaches that analyze actors' interactions and uncover suspicious patterns using advanced techniques.

Method: The authors developed a framework involving four preprocessing steps: (i) extracting graph structures, (ii) managing temporal data for large node sets, (iii) detecting communities, and (iv) generating weak ground-truth labels. Following preprocessing, three variants of Graph Autoencoders (GAE) were implemented to detect topological crime patterns.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated effectiveness in identifying complex financial crime schemes within transactional data. The preliminary evaluation showed promising outcomes compared to conventional detection methods.

Conclusion: The topology-driven, pattern-focused approach using GAEs offers a significant potential to advance financial crime detection, providing better adaptability and efficacy over traditional rule-based systems.

Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the SDM activation function, enhancing robustness and interpretability in neural networks compared to the standard softmax function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of the standard softmax function, including lack of robustness to distribution shifts and low interpretability.

Method: Introduce the SDM activation function by incorporating Similarity, Distance-to-training-distribution awareness, and existing Magnitude awareness.

Result: SDM shows improved robustness to co-variate shifts, better handling of out-of-distribution inputs, and enables interpretability-by-exemplar.

Conclusion: SDM activation is a preferable choice for selective classification tasks, outperforming softmax even when post-hoc calibration methods are applied.

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of slow and lengthy training times when using machine learning libraries on large datasets.

Method: The paper rewrote algorithms like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) mathematically, optimizing them to reduce training time while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Result: EmbeddedML achieved training-time reductions: SVM training improved by ~2x on small datasets and ~800x on large datasets; Logistic Regression training improved by ~4x compared to scikit-learn.

Conclusion: EmbeddedML provides optimized implementations of common machine learning algorithms that significantly reduce training time while maintaining effectiveness in regression and classification tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning models and libraries can train datasets of different sizes
and perform prediction and classification operations, but machine learning
models and libraries cause slow and long training times on large datasets. This
article introduces EmbeddedML, a training-time-optimized and mathematically
enhanced machine learning library. The speed was increased by approximately
times compared to scikit-learn without any loss in terms of accuracy in
regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression. Logistic Regression and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to
reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the
applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by
approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on
large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared
to the scikit-learn implementation. In summary, the EmbeddedML library offers
regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms
that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.

*Denis Janiak,Julia Moska,Dawid Motyka,Karolina Seweryn,Pawe≈Ç Walkowiak,Bartosz ≈ªuk,Arkadiusz Janz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified evaluation framework to assess and compare LLM alignment methods, revealing trade-offs across key axes: factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a holistic evaluation framework to understand trade-offs between competing objectives in LLM alignment, which prior studies fail to address comprehensively.

Method: The authors evaluated four alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO) across five evaluation axes using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, employing a validated LLM-as-Judge prompt for benchmarking.

Result: DPO and KTO excelled in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO in safety, while PPO best balanced conciseness and proactivity. The analysis highlighted trade-offs and strengths of different alignment techniques.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable insights into the trade-offs of various alignment methods, paving the way for more balanced and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.
Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking
a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified
evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO)
across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human
studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead
in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings
provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the
development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

*Hannah Markgraf,Shamburaj Sawant,Hanna Krasowski,Lukas Sch√§fer,Sebastien Gros,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares two projection-based safety filters in reinforcement learning (SE-RL and SP-RL) and highlights how action aliasing affects them differently. It proposes a novel penalty to improve SP-RL and provides empirical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a formal understanding of SE-RL and SP-RL differences, focusing on their limitations in safety-critical RL applications, specifically addressing the issue of action aliasing.

Method: The research unifies SE-RL and SP-RL under actor-critic frameworks, analyzes their policy gradients theoretically concerning action aliasing, and proposes mitigation strategies, including a penalty-based method for improving SP-RL.

Result: The study finds that SP-RL is more affected by action aliasing than SE-RL but can be significantly improved using the proposed penalty technique, eventually outperforming SE-RL in some environments.

Conclusion: This paper offers theoretical insights and practical recommendations for selecting and enhancing projection-based safe RL methods, emphasizing SP-RL's potential when properly mitigated against action aliasing.

Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them
to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints
in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly
considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part
of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the
policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical
relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their
differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of
SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected
by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected
to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In
SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it
manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through
the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of
SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical
analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role
of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,
including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with
established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical
predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than
for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or
outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings
provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL
methods based on task characteristics.

*Mengyi Deng,Xin Li,Tingyu Zhu,Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations in existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches and studies bidirectional reasoning using reverse reasoning datasets (r1k) derived from forward examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how bidirectional reasoning objectives can impact model alignment and improve accuracy, given the limitations of traditional unidirectional SFT approaches in capturing diverse reasoning patterns.

Method: The authors created r1k, a reverse reasoning dataset generated by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k, and compared the effects of SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on alignment strategies.

Result: SFT on r1k showed a significant accuracy improvement of 1.6%‚Äì6.8% compared to using s1k alone. However, combining forward and reverse data in SFT weakened directional distinctions, and DPO could only partially address this issue while introducing other conflicts.

Conclusion: Mixed reasoning data may introduce conflicting supervision signals and require more robust and direction-aware alignment strategies to balance accuracy and reasoning path consistency.

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

Motivation: Existing large language models struggle with real-world tasks requiring precise, compositional, and up-to-date knowledge integration with specialized tool use.

Method: Tool-R1 employs reinforcement learning to optimize multi-step tool-usage workflows through Python code execution, integrating user-defined tools and standard libraries, and utilizing an outcome-based reward function.

Result: Tool-R1 achieved a 10% accuracy improvement over strong baselines on the GAIA benchmark, with even larger gains on complex multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: Tool-R1 enables reliable and efficient reasoning via tool integration, highlighting its potential for real-world applications requiring complex operations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be

TL;DR: TimeCluster uses overlapping windows and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to discover patterns in multivariate time series. It is shown to be mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to introduce an innovative method for uncovering meaningful structure in multivariate time series, bridging visual analytics with classical system identification techniques.

Method: TimeCluster forms sliding-window matrices from time series and applies PCA via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract low-dimensional linear subspaces.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that embeddings generated by TimeCluster align with classical subspace identification methods.

Conclusion: The equivalence of the two methods opens pathways for further applications, including forecasting, online processing, handling external inputs, and managing corrupted data efficiently.

Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long
multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a
low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is
mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification
(block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both
approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time
series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace
system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a
time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix
recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the
cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification
methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals
confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss
future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from
the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and
visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying
trends in corrupted data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios by improving feature representation and boosting performance.

Method: The framework iteratively trains a soft decision tree while simultaneously learning a linear input feature transform, enabling end-to-end optimization.

Result: Demonstrated improved efficiency and performance on synthetic and real-world datasets by optimizing feature selection and boosting.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective in high-dimensional data scenarios, avoids overfitting, and provides a basis for further reproducibility and extensions.

Abstract: We propose a soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that
embeds a learnable linear feature transform within the boosting procedure. At
each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input
feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in
high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant
input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the
performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to
differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To
support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the gap in reasoning and uncertainty-reduction capabilities observed in open-source models compared to proprietary systems in handling complex benchmarks.

Method: WebSailor utilizes structured sampling, information obfuscation, Reinforcement Learning from Feedback (RFT) cold start, and the Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO) algorithm.

Result: WebSailor significantly enhances performance in complex information-seeking tasks, outperforming open-source agents and rivaling proprietary systems.

Conclusion: WebSailor offers a viable solution to elevate open-source agents' reasoning abilities to match proprietary agents, closing the capability gap.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,

### [288] [Sy-FAR: Symmetry-based Fair Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12939)
*Haneen Najjar,Eyal Ronen,Mahmood Sharif*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Security-critical ML systems face adversarial vulnerabilities and often suffer from unfair robustness, making attacks easier for certain groups or classes. Sy-FAR introduces the concept of symmetry as a more feasible fairness approach compared to achieving parity and significantly improves fair adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of fairness in adversarial robustness for security-critical ML systems, where traditional methods fail due to impracticality in achieving perfect parity among classes, particularly in fairness-critical scenarios like face recognition.

Method: The authors propose Sy-FAR, a technique that encourages symmetry in adversarial robustness while optimizing overall security against attacks. Symmetry ensures attacks between class pairs have equal success rates, leveraging the symmetric relationship of class resemblance.

Result: Evaluation of Sy-FAR across five datasets and three model architectures demonstrates its superiority over state-of-the-art methods by significantly enhancing fair adversarial robustness, reducing vulnerabilities, and showing faster, consistent performance.

Conclusion: Achieving symmetry in adversarial robustness offers a practical and effective approach to fairness in security-critical ML systems. Sy-FAR proves beneficial in improving both fairness and robustness while addressing new unfairness vulnerabilities identified in the study.

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

*Jaume Banus,Augustin C. Ogier,Roger Hullin,Philippe Meyer,Ruud B. van Heeswijk,Jonas Richiardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a probabilistic framework combining advanced neural network methods to model structured spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics from sparse data, achieving high classification accuracy and reconstruction/extrapolation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to accurately model cardiac motion from sparse observations to improve disease classification and analysis of biomedical spatiotemporal data.

Method: The authors integrate neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes to form a unified probabilistic framework that models latent trajectories on spatiotemporal multiplex graphs.

Result: The model achieved accurate trajectory reconstruction and extrapolation, state-of-the-art performance in cardiac disease classification (99% accuracy for ACDC, 67% for atrial fibrillation detection), and validated its efficacy on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust approach for analyzing cardiac motion and lays groundwork for broader applications of graph-based modeling in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal
dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach
integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural
networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures
uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent
dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent
trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context
observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over
latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and
extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic
dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto
oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK
Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and
disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs
trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed
cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up
to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with
competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible
approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based
learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

*Honghong Zeng,Jiong Lou,Zhe Wang,Hefeng Zhou,Chentao Wu,Wei Zhao,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study on the security of prototype-based federated learning (PFL) reveals it is resistant to traditional backdoor attacks but introduces a new specialized attack called BAPFL, achieving high success rates while maintaining task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data heterogeneity challenges in federated learning while exploring the potential vulnerabilities of PFL against backdoor attacks.

Method: The BAPFL attack combines prototype poisoning to mislead clients‚Äô local training and trigger optimization to generate stealthy, effective triggers for each target label.

Result: Experimental evaluations show BAPFL substantially improves attack success rates by 35%-75% over traditional methods, while preserving the model's accuracy for standard tasks.

Conclusion: BAPFL demonstrates the PFL framework's vulnerability to specialized backdoor attacks, highlighting the need for enhanced defense mechanisms in federated learning systems.

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages
mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However,
its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor
attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data
heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the
first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL
integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization
mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of
global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing
their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of
trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns
a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the
prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global
prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets
and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in
attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving
main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.

*Ya Zhou,Yujie Yang,Xiaohan Fan,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a post-training strategy that significantly enhances the performance of ECG foundation models, showcased on the PTB-XL benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance limitations of ECG foundation models in clinical applications compared to task-specific models.

Method: Developing and applying a post-training strategy involving techniques such as stochastic depth and preview linear probing.

Result: The proposed approach improved macro AUROC by 1.2%-3.3%, macro AUPRC by 5.3%-20.9%, and exhibited strong sample efficiency with significant performance gains using only 10% of training data.

Conclusion: Post-training strategies are pivotal in improving ECG foundation models, advancing their applicability in clinical domains.

Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through
feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational
autoencoder (VAE). The resulting latent spaces follow multivariate standard
Gaussian distributions, enabling analytical computation of confidence intervals

*Qitan Shi,Cheng Jin,Jiawei Zhang,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReTrack, a method for efficient data unlearning in diffusion models to tackle privacy concerns, balancing unlearning strength and image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face privacy challenges due to training data memorization, necessitating a mechanism for selective data removal without full retraining.

Method: ReTrack uses importance sampling to refine the fine-tuning loss by approximating dominant terms and redirects denoising trajectories toward $k$-nearest neighbors for efficient unlearning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ReTrack's superior performance across datasets like MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion, achieving strong unlearning while maintaining high generative quality.

Conclusion: ReTrack offers a practical solution to privacy concerns with diffusion models, unlearning data effectively without compromising on the quality of generated outputs.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer
from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns.
Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of
specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and
effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs
importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we
approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable
objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest
neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality.
Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show
that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off
between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.

*Yukun Chen,Zhaoxi Mu,Andong Li,Peilin Li,Xinyu Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spiking Vocos, an energy-efficient spiking neural vocoder, addressing the high power consumption challenge of neural vocoders on edge devices. It achieves comparable performance to artificial neural networks while drastically reducing energy usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient neural vocoders arises due to the high energy consumption of traditional models, hindering their practical deployment in low-resource edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks provide a promising pathway toward energy-efficient machine learning solutions.

Method: The authors build Spiking Vocos on an efficient Vocos framework, leveraging a Spiking ConvNeXt design to minimize computational operations, amplitude shortcuts to preserve dynamics, self-architectural distillation for knowledge transfer, and a Temporal Shift Module to integrate temporal information effectively.

Result: Spiking Vocos achieves comparable fidelity to Artificial Neural Networks in vocoder tasks with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45, respectively, while consuming merely 14.7% of the energy.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of Spiking Neural Networks in delivering high-performance neural vocoders with significant energy savings, paving the way for practical deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural
vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical
deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their
event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with
ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To
mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking
ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate
an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to
bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to
effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also
integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the
temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN
counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while
consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffuSR, a pre-training framework for symbolic regression using diffusion language models to discover mathematical equations from data more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in symbolic regression, such as vast search space and balancing equation accuracy and complexity for scientific discovery.

Method: DiffuSR uses a continuous-state diffusion language model, trainable embeddings for symbols, iterative denoising, cross-attention mechanisms with numerical data, and logit priors injected into genetic programming for inference.

Result: DiffuSR demonstrates performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods, generates interpretable equations, and offers diverse outputs on symbolic regression benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiffuSR is a robust framework that effectively models equation distributions, providing innovative solutions to the symbolic regression problem while advancing interpretable scientific discovery.

Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse
mathematical expressions.

*Paul Garnier,Vincent Lannelongue,Elie Hachem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a coarse-to-fine curriculum for accelerating Graph Neural Network (GNN) training on high-resolution unstructured meshes for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training GNNs on high-resolution meshes is computationally expensive, and a method to accelerate convergence is needed.

Method: A coarse-to-fine curriculum is used, where GNNs are first trained on coarse meshes and progressively introduced to higher-resolution meshes during training.

Result: The method achieves comparable generalization accuracy while reducing training wall-clock time by up to 50%. It also allows the model to overcome learning plateaus on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: The coarse-to-fine curriculum significantly enhances training efficiency and model performance without altering the GNN architecture.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.

*Kushal Bose,Swagatam Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of graph heterophily on the performance of low-pass filters like GCN, particularly by modifying the graph with self-loops and parallel edges, analyzing their effects on the graph's Laplacian eigenvalues and performance trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of graph heterophily in MP-GNNs, which degrades the performance of low-pass filters due to mixing messages from dissimilar neighboring nodes.

Method: The authors study the effect of adding self-loops and parallel edges on heterophilic graphs by analyzing the changes in eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian and inspecting its impact on GCN performance on benchmark networks.

Result: Findings indicate GCN performance varies with the number of self-loops and parallel edges in heterophilic graphs, linking these trends to the graph spectrum properties.

Conclusion: The work provides a method to evaluate graph spectrum and properties indirectly through low-pass filter performance trends, avoiding costly eigenvalue decomposition, while establishing theoretical connections.

Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of
Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters
like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which
can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring
nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still
requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic
graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by
increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several
studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic
networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that
the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding
self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established
connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the
low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the
essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of
connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our
work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by
observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the
costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed
to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph
spectrum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets aimed at testing LLM agents' search and reasoning capabilities in realistic and complex financial contexts.

Method: FinSearchComp contains 635 questions divided into tasks such as Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation. Professional financial experts and a rigorous annotation process ensure the quality of benchmarks.

Result: Among 21 models evaluated, Grok 4 (web) excelled in global tasks while DouBao (web) performed best in Greater China subsets. Agents with web search and financial plugins showed improved performance.

Conclusion: FinSearchComp provides a robust, realistic evaluation framework for LLM agents, emphasizing their importance in search and reasoning for financial applications.

Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely
viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a
particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex,
multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70
professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous
multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions
spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products)
on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy.
DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that
equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves
results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact
performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and
providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional,
high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper examines the robustness of probabilistic classifiers against changes in private features, linking robustness to predictive accuracy. Experiments confirm this correlation, aiming to balance fairness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how perturbations in private features impact fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers and whether robustness correlates with predictive accuracy.

Method: The study employs Bayesian networks across 14 datasets, reformulating robustness analysis as a most probable explanation task in a Markov random field to manage computational challenges.

Result: Experiments confirm that more robust instances are classified more accurately, supporting the hypothesized correlation.

Conclusion: The findings open potential strategies to reduce the fairness-accuracy trade-off, indicating a connection between robustness and predictive accuracy in fairness contexts.

Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the
traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the concept of robustness and transferability in graph convolution techniques, such as Covariance Neural Networks (VNNs), from finite-dimensional to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Method: The authors propose Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and construct HVNs by stacking HVFs with nonlinear activations. A principled discretization procedure is defined, and theoretical results are provided, showing HVFs can recover Functional PCA (FPCA).

Result: The proposed HVNs are validated on synthetic and real-world datasets with strong performance in time-series classification tasks, outperforming MLPs and FPCA classifiers in robustness.

Conclusion: Hilbert coVariance Networks effectively generalize covariance-based convolution and learning techniques to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, offering stronger classification performance and versatility across different data types and tasks.

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning proves its superiority in limited entropy and unsupervised settings with the introduction of the MINO framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the claim that meta-learning is comparable to whole-class training and prove meta-learning‚Äôs advantage, especially in scenarios with limited entropy and unsupervised tasks.

Method: The paper establishes an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons, performs theoretical analysis and experimental validations, and introduces MINO‚Äîa framework integrating adaptive clustering (DBSCAN) and stability-based meta-scaler for robust unsupervised learning.

Result: Meta-learning demonstrates tighter generalization bounds, increased robustness, and efficiency under specific conditions. MINO is effective in various unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: Meta-learning outperforms whole-class training in limited entropy environments and unsupervised settings. The proposed MINO framework leverages this advantage effectively for robust task construction and noise resilience.

Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

TL;DR: TRUST-FS is a novel multi-view feature selection method that jointly addresses feature selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning for incomplete multi-view data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-view unsupervised feature selection including incomplete data handling, interactions between feature selection and imputation, and inaccuracies in similarity graphs due to missing data.

Method: Proposes Tensorized Reliable UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS) using adaptive-weighted CP decomposition within a unified tensor-factorization framework, integrating feature selection, imputation, and view weight learning.

Result: Experimental validation shows TRUST-FS's effectiveness and superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods in handling incomplete multi-view datasets.

Conclusion: TRUST-FS improves the reliability of feature selection by simultaneously solving imputation and similarity graph limitations, proving its value in real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative
features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research
interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,
several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data
are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more
general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values
in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing
missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two
processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can
result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of
feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for
incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable
UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new
adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature
selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a
unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to
acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates
learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature
selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid U-Net autoencoder with a Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) for improved temporal clustering of spatiotemporal climate data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limitations of conventional clustering methods in handling high-dimensional spatiotemporal climate data, which often fail to capture complex temporal dependencies, spatial relationships, and dynamic non-stationarity.

Method: The authors propose a time-distributed U-Net autoencoder architecture that combines ConvLSTM2D modules and skip connections for spatial-temporal feature extraction, along with B-TGAT for graph-based spatial modeling and temporal encoding. This hybrid design produces latent embeddings optimized for clustering.

Result: The model demonstrates superior cluster separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions on three distinct climate datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net skip connections, and B-TGAT improves temporal clustering of spatiotemporal climate data while providing interpretable insights, contributing to advancements in both computational methodology and climate science.

Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions

### [304] [HAM: Hierarchical Adapter Merging for Scalable Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13211)
*Eric Nuertey Coleman,Luigi Quarantiello,Samrat Mukherjee,Julio Hurtado,Vincenzo Lomonaco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hierarchical Adapters Merging (HAM), a method to address continual learning challenges, notably catastrophic forgetting, using a dynamic hierarchical structure that merges adapters for effective task management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning in deep learning models encounters catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge interferes with previously learned information. Existing solutions like pre-trained models and PEFT methods still face challenges with novel data distributions and scalability in dynamic learning scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce HAM, which maintains a fixed hierarchical structure to dynamically group and merge task adapters based on their similarity. Each task is equipped with a low-rank adapter and an importance scalar. This hierarchical grouping and merging reduce complexity and improve transfer learning between tasks.

Result: HAM was validated through experiments on three vision benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks scales.

Conclusion: HAM provides an effective and scalable solution for continual learning, addressing challenges like catastrophic forgetting and task interference, proving its efficacy across various tasks and settings.

Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it
poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary
issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,
causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can
partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and
over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data
distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,
enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face
challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of
tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases
the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical
Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters
from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale
effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with
improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that
hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank
adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on
adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,
facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on
three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

*Paolo Climaco,Jochen Garcke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DA-FPS, a novel sampling method for training machine learning regression models in data-scarce scenarios, achieving better prediction accuracy by minimizing an error-bound estimate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of training regression models under limited labeled data, focusing on selecting efficient training sets to balance performance and cost.

Method: The paper derives an error bound based on weighted fill distance and introduces DA-FPS, a sampling method that minimizes this bound using data feature representations.

Result: DA-FPS outperforms other sampling methods by significantly reducing the mean absolute prediction error in experiments across two regression models and three datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging DA-FPS for training data sampling enhances regression model accuracy efficiently, especially in scenarios with constrained data-labeling resources.

Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where
the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational
constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from
unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the
selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling
methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper
bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression
models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set,
a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We
introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling
method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven
estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our
derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three
datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean
absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.

*J. Cha,J. Lee,J. Cho,J. Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOSSIL, a unified framework to tackle imbalanced and small data scenarios, outperforming existing methods while ensuring simplicity and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in domains where data is scarce and imbalanced, such as rare disease imaging and genomics, and enhance robustness against artifact-prone naive augmentations.

Method: FOSSIL incorporates class imbalance correction, curriculum learning, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a unified weighting formula, augmented by regret-based theoretical guarantees.

Result: FOSSIL consistently outperforms traditional approaches like ERM and meta-weighting baselines across both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FOSSIL offers a robust and interpretable solution for imbalanced and small data problems without requiring architectural modifications, delivering theoretical soundness and empirical benefits.

Abstract: Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare
disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are
scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions
such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of
this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible
Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting
framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction,
difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a
single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework
provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical
gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and
real-world datasets, while requiring no architectural changes.

### [307] [On the Out-of-Distribution Backdoor Attack for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13219)
*Jiahao Xu,Zikai Zhang,Rui Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses security vulnerabilities in federated learning by introducing an out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$) and a server-side defense strategy ($\mathtt{BNGuard$).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning are limited by visible triggers and physical modifications, which constrain their flexibility and practicality.

Method: Proposed $\mathtt{OBA}$ utilizes OOD data as poisoned samples and triggers. To improve stealthiness, $\mathtt{SoDa}$ regularizes the local model parameters. For defense, $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ detects attack traces by monitoring batch normalization statistics.

Result: $\mathtt{OBA}$ bypasses state-of-the-art defenses and maintains task accuracy. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ effectively identifies and mitigates malicious updates caused by $\mathtt{SoDa}$.

Conclusion: The study expands backdoor attack scenarios in FL while introducing a robust defense mechanism, contributing to enhanced security in the field.

Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within
constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require
physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for
FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which
uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our
approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.
To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$,
which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models
during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to
evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively
circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the
main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against
$\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data
causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization
layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and
exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.
Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available
at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.

### [308] [Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13237)
*Aniket Didolkar,Nicolas Ballas,Sanjeev Arora,Anirudh Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can improve reasoning efficiency by converting recurring reasoning patterns into concise instructions, significantly reducing token usage and improving accuracy across various test settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inefficiencies and context saturation caused by repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs, while enabling faster and more accurate multi-step problem solving.

Method: Convert recurring reasoning fragments into reusable "behaviors" using LLM's metacognitive analysis. Store and utilize these behaviors via a "behavior handbook" during inference or through supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Approach reduces token usage by up to 46%, improves future reasoning accuracy by up to 10%, and enhances reasoning capabilities of non-reasoning models more effectively than standard methods.

Conclusion: Teaching LLMs procedural reasoning methods can enhance their ability to remember reasoning strategies, improving efficiency and robustness in multitask problem solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

### [309] [Don't Forget the Nonlinearity: Unlocking Activation Functions in Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13240)
*Bo Yin,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NoRA is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that adapts activation functions instead of weight matrices in transformer models, leading to improved performance with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods mainly focus on updating weight matrices and leave activation functions unchanged. This paper seeks to explore the untapped potential of adapting activation functions for model fine-tuning.

Method: NoRA modifies fixed activation functions with learnable rational functions. It applies low-rank updates to these functions‚Äô coefficients in a group-wise manner, which promotes stability and limits computational costs.

Result: On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4% of parameters. When combined with LoRA (as NoRA++), it outperforms existing PEFT methods on various benchmarks, including gains of +0.3% to +0.8% in LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning.

Conclusion: NoRA demonstrates that tuning activation functions can be an effective and complementary alternative to weight-based methods for PEFT. It positions activation-space tuning as a compelling approach for model adaptation.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt
weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce
\textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear
activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces
fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured
low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise
design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On
vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds
full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving
accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA
(\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets
by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++
consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of
+0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We
further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional
subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results
establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly
parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation
functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

*Zhizhong Zhao,Ke Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel uncertainty quantification framework using a post-hoc method that efficiently handles both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties without retraining models, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods in deep learning are either computationally demanding or offer limited, task-specific estimates, leading to the need for a more efficient and comprehensive approach.

Method: The proposed framework uses a post-hoc technique called Split-Point Analysis (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals and compute Mean Absolute Residuals (MARs), alongside a Self-consistency Discrepancy Score (SDS) for fine-grained uncertainty estimation.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art UQ methods across regression and classification benchmarks, with improved empirical coverage and calibrated predictions, while maintaining low computational overhead.

Conclusion: This approach offers an efficient and trustworthy solution for uncertainty quantification in deep learning, showcasing a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet
existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or
ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as
single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc
single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method
applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals
into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)
on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the
harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency
Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across
regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile
regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which
are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are
available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax
outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.
Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ
methods while incurring minimal overhead.

### [311] [JANUS: A Dual-Constraint Generative Framework for Stealthy Node Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13266)
*Jiahao Zhang,Xiaobing Pei,Zhaokun Zhong,Wenqiang Hao,Zhenghao Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes JANUS, a novel method for stealthy node injection attacks in graph neural networks by maintaining both geometric and semantic consistency with original graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing node injection attack methods often fail in stealthiness by relying on indirect metrics, ignoring injected content characteristics, or focusing only on local structures, leading to challenges in mimicking original graph patterns.

Method: JANUS introduces a dual-constraint framework combining local feature manifold alignment for geometric consistency and global semantic alignment using structured latent variables and mutual information maximization. The attacks are modeled as a sequential decision process solved via reinforcement learning.

Result: JANUS demonstrates superior performance, both in attack effectiveness and stealthiness, on multiple standard datasets.

Conclusion: The dual-constraint approach of JANUS addresses stealthiness challenges in node injection attacks, offering a significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

### [312] [LLMs for energy and macronutrients estimation using only text data from 24-hour dietary recalls: a parameter-efficient fine-tuning experiment using a 10-shot prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13268)
*Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to predict nutritional content from text-based dietary recalls, showing good accuracy after applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current nutritional content estimation tools primarily rely on image inputs, and the effectiveness of LLMs for text-based predictions has not been proven. If successful, this could simplify dietary monitoring by removing the necessity for photographs.

Method: Researchers utilized 24-hour dietary recall data from adolescents in the NHANES dataset. They used a 10-shot, chain-of-thought prompting strategy with an open-source quantized LLM and fine-tuned it using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to estimate energy and nutrient values.

Result: The fine-tuned model showed significant improvement over the vanilla LLM, achieving a mean absolute error of 171.34-190.90 for energy predictions and Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) exceeding 0.89 for all tested metrics.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs with PEFT allows for accurate text-based predictions of nutritional values from 24-hour dietary recalls, offering potential for low-burden dietary monitoring tools.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional
content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can
accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of
foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable
simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used
24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM
was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and
five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their
quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate
whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the
ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber
and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,
mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean
absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across
endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,
with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC
exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a
chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed
solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values
from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,
text-based dietary monitoring tools.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a software-hardware co-design combining adaptive normalizing flow (ANF) models and resistive memory-based neural differential equation solvers to enhance Lattice Field Theory simulations by improving computational and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper was motivated by challenges in Lattice Field Theory simulations, including high computational costs, limited parallelizability in current sampling algorithms, and energy inefficiencies in digital hardware.

Method: The authors developed a co-design integrating an ANF model for parallel configuration generation with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning, combined with resistive memory-based in-memory computing hardware for increased performance and energy efficiency.

Result: The approach was validated on phi4 theory and graphene wire simulations, achieving substantial improvements: up to 13.9-fold reductions in autocorrelation time, 16.1-17.0-fold GPU speedups, and 73.7-138.0-fold energy efficiency gains.

Conclusion: The co-design successfully addresses computational and efficiency limitations in Lattice Field Theory simulations, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for complex systems.

Abstract: Lattice field theory (LFT) simulations underpin advances in classical
statistical mechanics and quantum field theory, providing a unified
computational framework across particle, nuclear, and condensed matter physics.
However, the application of these methods to high-dimensional systems remains
severely constrained by several challenges, including the prohibitive
computational cost and limited parallelizability of conventional sampling
algorithms such as hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), the substantial training expense
associated with traditional normalizing flow models, and the inherent energy
inefficiency of digital hardware architectures. Here, we introduce a
software-hardware co-design that integrates an adaptive normalizing flow (ANF)
model with a resistive memory-based neural differential equation solver,
enabling efficient generation of LFT configurations. Software-wise, ANF enables
efficient parallel generation of statistically independent configurations,
thereby reducing computational costs, while low-rank adaptation (LoRA) allows
cost-effective fine-tuning across diverse simulation parameters. Hardware-wise,
in-memory computing with resistive memory substantially enhances both
parallelism and energy efficiency. We validate our approach on the scalar phi4
theory and the effective field theory of graphene wires, using a hybrid
analog-digital neural differential equation solver equipped with a 180 nm
resistive memory in-memory computing macro. Our co-design enables low-cost
computation, achieving approximately 8.2-fold and 13.9-fold reductions in
integrated autocorrelation time over HMC, while requiring fine-tuning of less
than 8% of the weights via LoRA. Compared to state-of-the-art GPUs, our
co-design achieves up to approximately 16.1- and 17.0-fold speedups for the two
tasks, as well as 73.7- and 138.0-fold improvements in energy efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why humans learn meaningful sentences faster than random words and how mechanisms can simulate this process in artificial systems.

Method: The research integrates the SWOW-EN dataset into a spiking neural network utilizing the Hierarchical Temporal Memory model to simulate long-term memory.

Result: The neural network demonstrates quicker learning for meaningful constructs like poems compared to random word sequences. It also exhibits improved resilience to noise when initialized with SWOW-EN.

Conclusion: Embedding human-like association norms into neural network memory frameworks can enhance learning speeds for structured information and improve robustness under noisy conditions.

Abstract: Learning meaningful sentences is different from learning a random set of
words. When humans understand the meaning, the learning occurs relatively
quickly. What mechanisms enable this to happen? In this paper, we examine the
learning of novel sequences in familiar situations. We embed the Small World of
Words (SWOW-EN), a Word Association Norms (WAN) dataset, in a spiking neural
network based on the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) model to simulate
long-term memory. Results show that in the presence of SWOW-EN, there is a
clear difference in speed between the learning of meaningful sentences and
random noise. For example, short poems are learned much faster than sequences
of random words. In addition, the system initialized with SWOW-EN weights shows
greater tolerance to noise.

*Yimin Zhang,Mario de Sousa*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The study investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate Ladder Diagram (LD) to Sequential Function Chart (SFC) conversion, with promising accuracy (79%-91%) based on new datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges like state explosion and lack of domain-specific knowledge in LD-to-SFC conversion, facilitated by advancements in AI and LLMs.

Method: The authors constructed datasets of paired textual representations of LD and SFC programs conforming to IEC 61131-3 and fine-tuned an LLM to test its performance on this conversion task.

Result: The fine-tuned LLM achieved accuracy ranging from 79% to 91% in LD-to-SFC conversion on their datasets.

Conclusion: The study shows that LLMs, with proper datasets and training, can be effective tools for automating LD-to-SFC conversion, paving the way for further AI-driven advancements in PLC programming.

Abstract: In the domain of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming, converting
a Ladder Diagram (LD) into a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) is an inherently
challenging problem, primarily due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge and
the issue of state explosion in existing algorithms. However, the rapid
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - especially Large Language Model
(LLM) - offers a promising new approach.
  Despite this potential, data-driven approaches in this field have been
hindered by a lack of suitable datasets. To address this gap, we constructed
several datasets consisting of paired textual representations of SFC and LD
programs that conform to the IEC 61131-3 standard.
  Based on these datasets, we explored the feasibility of automating the LD-SFC
conversion using LLM. Our preliminary experiments show that a fine-tuned LLM
model achieves up to 91% accuracy on certain dataset, with the lowest observed
accuracy being 79%, suggesting that with proper training and representation,
LLMs can effectively support LD-SFC conversion. These early results highlight
the viability and future potential of this approach.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to generate smaller linear programming (LP) formulations from algorithms, reducing size while maintaining generality and validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the inefficiency of existing methods for specifying LP constraints through Algebraic Modeling Languages, as well as the challenges posed by the large size of polynomial LPs generated by newer methods.

Method: The proposed method uses a hierarchical linear pipelining technique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized execution regions, which localizes LP constraints and variables.

Result: The paper demonstrates a $25$-fold reduction in LP size and improved performance in LP solver capacities for benchmark problems like the makespan problem and the weighted minimum spanning tree problem.

Conclusion: The hierarchical linear pipelining technique effectively reduces LP size without losing problem generality or validity, offering improvements for LP solvers both commercial and non-commercial.

Abstract: Linear Programming (LP) is widely applied in industry and is a key component
of various other mathematical problem-solving techniques. Recent work
introduced an LP compiler translating polynomial-time, polynomial-space
algorithms into polynomial-size LPs using intuitive high-level programming
languages, offering a promising alternative to manually specifying each set of
constraints through Algebraic Modeling Languages (AMLs). However, the resulting
LPs, while polynomial in size, are often extremely large, posing challenges for
existing LP solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating
substantially smaller LPs from algorithms. Our goal is to establish
minimum-size compact LP formulations for problems in P having natural
formulations with exponential extension complexities. Our broader vision is to
enable the systematic generation of Compact Integer Programming (CIP)
formulations for problems with exponential-size IPs having polynomial-time
separation oracles. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical linear pipelining
technique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized regions
with well-defined execution transitions -- functions of compile-time
parameters. This decomposition allows us to localize LP constraints and
variables within each region, significantly reducing LP size without the loss
of generality, ensuring the resulting LP remains valid for all inputs of size
$n$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark problems
-- the makespan problem, which has exponential extension complexity, and the
weighted minimum spanning tree problem -- both of which have exponential-size
natural LPs. Our results show up to a $25$-fold reduction in LP size and
substantial improvements in solver performance across both commercial and
non-commercial LP solvers.

### [318] [Pleasant Imperative Program Proofs with GallinaC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13019)
*Fr√©d√©ric Fort,David Nowak,Vlad Rusu*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GallinaC, a shallow embedding of an imperative programming language into Gallina, enabling correctness proofs within the Rocq proof assistant. It aims to simplify verifying real-world imperative programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imperative programming remains essential, especially for low-level software like operating system kernels, but current languages are overly permissive, making correctness proofs complex and error-prone.

Method: The authors created GallinaC, a Turing-complete imperative language embedded within Gallina, the Rocq proof assistant, which allows combining functional and imperative proofs using unified tactics.

Result: The prototype implementation validated GallinaC's viability through correctness proofs for a linked-list reversal procedure and highlighted its potential. Focus is now on forward simulation with Cminor, the CompCert back-end.

Conclusion: GallinaC offers a promising framework for enabling correctness proofs for imperative programs, providing well-defined semantics while being compatible with proof-assistant ecosystems. Further development is underway.

Abstract: Even with the increase of popularity of functional programming, imperative
programming remains a key programming paradigm, especially for programs
operating at lower levels of abstraction. When such software offers key
components of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB), e.g. an operating system kernel,
it becomes desirable to provide mathematical correctness proofs.
  However, current real-world imperative programming languages possess
"expressive", i.e. overly permissive, semantics. Thus, producing correctness
proofs of such programs becomes tedious and error-prone, requiring to take care
of numerous "administrative" details. Ideally, a proof-oriented imperative
language should feature well-behaved semantics while allowing imperative
idioms.
  To obtain a high-degree of confidence in the correctness of such a language,
its tools should be developed inside a proof-assistant such that program proofs
are machine checked.
  We present GallinaC, a shallow embedding of a Turing-complete imperative
language directly inside the functional programming language of the Rocq proof
assistant, Gallina. In particular, it features a truly generic and unbounded
while loop. Having a functional core means proofs about GallinaC programs may
use the same tactics as proofs about pure functional ones.
  Work on GallinaC is still under progress, but we present first promising
results. A prototype implementation has shown the viability of GallinaC with
the correctness proof of a list reversal procedure for linked-lists of unknown
size. We currently focus on the forward simulation between the GallinaC
intermediate representation (IR) and Cminor, the entry language of the CompCert
back-end.

### [321] [Rebound: Efficient, Expressive, and Well-Scoped Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13261)
*No√© De Santo,Stephanie Weirich*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: "Rebound" is a Haskell library for term representations, automating substitutions and alpha-equivalence with improved performance via first-class environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and ensure correctness when dealing with operations like substitutions and alpha-equivalence in programming languages, which often involve complex invariants.

Method: The paper introduces a library leveraging first-class environments with static scope tracking, optimizing substitution operations while ensuring safe use of de Bruijn indices.

Result: Demonstrated expressiveness of Rebound through several advanced examples like type-checkers. Benchmarks indicate it outperforms competing libraries in terms of performance.

Conclusion: Rebound effectively provides an expressive, correct, and high-performance solution for working with scoped term representations and binding structures.

Abstract: We introduce the Rebound library that supports well-scoped term
representations in Haskell and automates the definition of substitution,
alpha-equivalence, and other operations that work with binding structures. The
key idea of our design is the use of first-class environments that map
variables to expressions in some new scope. By statically tracking scopes,
users of this library gain confidence that they have correctly maintained the
subtle invariants that stem from using de Bruijn indices. Behind the scenes,
Rebound uses environments to optimize the application of substitutions, while
providing explicit access to these data structures when desired. We demonstrate
that this library is expressive by using it to implement a wide range of
language features with sophisticated uses of binding and several different
operations that use this abstract syntax. Our examples include pi-forall, a
tutorial implementation of a type checker for a dependently-typed programming
language. Finally, we benchmark Rebound to understand its performance
characteristics and find that it produces faster code than competing libraries.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for the joint development of lunar construction equipment's physical designs and controls, leveraging OpenPLX language to integrate CAD models with autonomous system simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize the development of lunar construction equipment by integrating design and control processes, enabling robust navigation and control capabilities tailored for lunar environments.

Method: The method involves leveraging OpenPLX, a declarative language, to create simulations of multibody dynamics, regolith interactions, and sensor imperfections, demonstrated through case studies like an autonomous lunar rover.

Result: The proposed framework successfully integrates physical designs with control systems, validated through case studies involving advanced navigation and control mechanisms.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the integration of CAD models and autonomous system simulations using OpenPLX enhances the development of lunar construction equipment, providing adaptable and autonomous solutions for lunar exploration.

Abstract: We envision an integrated process for developing lunar construction
equipment, where physical design and control are explored in parallel. In this
paper, we describe a technical framework that supports this process. It relies
on OpenPLX, a readable/writable declarative language that links CAD-models and
autonomous systems to high-fidelity, real-time 3D simulations of contacting
multibody dynamics, machine regolith interaction forces, and non-ideal sensors.
To demonstrate its capabilities, we present two case studies, including an
autonomous lunar rover that combines a vision-language model for navigation
with a reinforcement learning-based control policy for locomotion.

### [323] [Geometric Red-Teaming for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12379)
*Divyam Goel,Yufei Wang,Tiancheng Wu,Guixiu Qiao,Pavel Piliptchak,David Held,Zackory Erickson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometric Red-Teaming (GRT), a framework for evaluating the robustness of robotic manipulation policies by generating shape perturbations that cause failures in those policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, robotic manipulation is evaluated on static, curated test sets, which fail to capture the variability leading to potential system failures. A more robust evaluation framework is needed to identify and address failure modes.

Method: The authors propose GRT, which uses a Jacobian field-based deformation model and a gradient-free optimization strategy within a simulation to generate CrashShapes‚Äîgeometric deformities that challenge robotic policies. They also pair this with a blue-teaming method to fine-tune policies on the identified failures.

Result: GRT is able to identify vulnerabilities in robotic manipulation policies across various tasks such as insertion, articulation, and grasping, demonstrating its ability to find failure modes overlooked by traditional benchmarks. Fine-tuning with CrashShapes (blue-teaming) improved task success rates significantly.

Conclusion: The GRT framework provides a systematic approach to evaluate and improve the robustness of robotic manipulation policies, bridging gaps between simulation and real-world performance.

Abstract: Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy
performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight
into how systems fail under plausible variation. We introduce Geometric
Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through
object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes --
structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger
catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method
integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free,
simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation,
and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse
policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static
benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape
exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured,
object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally
show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as
blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those
shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the
utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we
validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm,
observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as
22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the
corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

*Evangelos Psomiadis,Panagiotis Tsiotras*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a distributed event-triggered controller for multi-robot systems to form desired formations using fewer resources, validated through simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address resource limitations in multi-agent formation control by reducing unnecessary updates in control, while ensuring stability and efficiency.

Method: A distributed event-triggered control strategy is introduced, where control updates depend on inter-agent measurement errors surpassing a preset threshold, reducing redundant actions.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments show that the approach conserves resources and achieves desired formations effectively, outperforming periodic triggering strategies.

Conclusion: The event-triggered controller offers a resource-efficient solution for multi-agent formation control without compromising system stability or performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of collaborative formation control for
multi-agent systems with limited resources. We consider a team of robots tasked
with achieving a desired formation from arbitrary initial configurations. To
reduce unnecessary control updates and conserve resources, we propose a
distributed event-triggered formation controller that relies on inter-agent
distance measurements. Control updates are triggered only when the measurement
error exceeds a predefined threshold, ensuring system stability. The proposed
controller is validated through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments involving different formations, communication topologies,
scalability tests, and variations in design parameters, while also being
compared against periodic triggering strategies. Results demonstrate that the
event-triggered approach significantly reduces control efforts while preserving
formation performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system enabling lightweight UAVs to perform high-quality 3D reconstruction using a dual pipeline with real-time adjustments and final output refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address constraints of lightweight UAVs for complex tasks like 3D reconstruction in constrained areas.

Method: Combines real-time feedback loop (SfM-based pointcloud) and final reconstruction (NeRF-based approach) to autonomously adjust UAV flight paths.

Result: Dynamic trajectory adaptation improves 3D reconstruction quality compared to static flight paths, validated through experiments with Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable, autonomous solution for miniaturized UAVs, expanding their application for precise 3D scanning in constrained environments.

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for
navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in
payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like
high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,
high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100
grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates
a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A
near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model
quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently
capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data
acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline
employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)
approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)
location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this
architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both
single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory
adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight
paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks
the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in
constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger
platforms.

*Michael Lorenz,Bertram Taetz,Gabriele Bleser-Taetz,Didier Stricker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a real-time, calibration-free method for inertial motion capture to simplify setup, estimating global angular kinematics and joint positions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inertial motion capture methods suffer from inconvenient calibration processes, such as segment lengths or IMU-to-segment calibrations, which hinder ease of use.

Method: The authors developed a recursive Bayesian estimation algorithm for tracking global IMU angular kinematics and joint positions without requiring prior calibration, utilizing simulated IMU data.

Result: Experimental results on both simulated data from a kinematic chain and re-simulated human walking data demonstrated drift-free absolute orientation estimates, global heading accuracy, and fast convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a lightweight and robust solution for calibration-free inertial motion tracking in real-time across different scenarios.

Abstract: Inertial motion capture is a promising approach for capturing motion outside
the laboratory. However, as one major drawback, most of the current methods
require different quantities to be calibrated or computed offline as part of
the setup process, such as segment lengths, relative orientations between
inertial measurement units (IMUs) and segment coordinate frames (IMU-to-segment
calibrations) or the joint positions in the IMU frames. This renders the setup
process inconvenient. This work contributes to real-time capable
calibration-free inertial tracking of a kinematic chain, i.e. simultaneous
recursive Bayesian estimation of global IMU angular kinematics and joint
positions in the IMU frames, with a minimal state size. Experimental results on
simulated IMU data from a three-link kinematic chain (manipulator study) as
well as re-simulated IMU data from healthy humans walking (lower body study)
show that the calibration-free and lightweight algorithm provides not only
drift-free relative but also drift-free absolute orientation estimates with a
global heading reference for only one IMU as well as robust and fast
convergence of joint position estimates in the different movement scenarios.

### [327] [Computing forward statics from tendon-length in flexible-joint hyper-redundant manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12444)
*Weiting Feng,Kyle L. Walker,Yunjie Yang,Francesco Giorgio-Serchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a screw-based formulation for controlling hyper-redundant tendon-driven manipulators, which can use either tendon length or tension as input, enabling open-loop control without reliance on tension measurement or state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyper-redundant manipulators face challenges in control due to the need for accurate tension measurement or state estimation, which are often unreliable.

Method: The authors developed a screw-based formulation for the manipulators' forward statics and validated their solution experimentally using either tendon length or tension as input.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrated that the method successfully enables open-loop control in static conditions, even when relying solely on kinematic inputs like tendon length.

Conclusion: This approach addresses practical challenges by providing an effective control strategy for hyper-redundant manipulators, eliminating dependence on unreliable tension measurements or state estimation.

Abstract: Hyper-redundant tendon-driven manipulators offer greater flexibility and
compliance over traditional manipulators. A common way of controlling such
manipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control
parameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is
representative of the real operational conditions. However, when dealing with
manipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a
static force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping
from the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,
measurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust
tendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement
or state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not
always accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables
tension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics.
We develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment,
hyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics
iterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length
or tension as the input. This strategy is experimentally validated using a
traditional tension input first, subsequently showing the efficacy of the
method when exclusively tendon lengths are used. The results confirm the
possibility to perform open-loop control in static conditions using a kinematic
input only, thus bypassing some of the practical problems with tension
measurement and state estimation of hyper-redundant systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study investigates how tail design and control in a mudskipper-inspired robot enhance locomotion on deformable substrates like sand and mud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Terrestrial robots struggle with complex interactions on deformable surfaces such as sand and mud, necessitating innovative design approaches inspired by natural mechanisms.

Method: A bio-inspired robot emulating mudskipper behavior was tested experimentally by comparing locomotion performance between idle and actively oscillating tail configurations on granular media.

Result: Actively oscillating tails improved speed by 67%, reduced body drag by 46%, and fluidized the substrate, decreasing resistance. Tail morphology influenced oscillation efficiency based on surface area and insertion depth.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a design principle that tail selection strategies should consider substrate strength and tail morphology, offering advancements for robotics in agriculture, rescue, and exploration.

Abstract: Deformable substrates such as sand and mud present significant challenges for
terrestrial robots due to complex robot-terrain interactions. Inspired by
mudskippers, amphibious animals that naturally adjust their tail morphology and
movement jointly to navigate such environments, we investigate how tail design
and control can jointly enhance flipper-driven locomotion on granular media.
Using a bio-inspired robot modeled after the mudskipper, we experimentally
compared locomotion performance between idle and actively oscillating tail
configurations. Tail oscillation increased robot speed by 67% and reduced body
drag by 46%. Shear force measurements revealed that this improvement was
enabled by tail oscillation fluidizing the substrate, thereby reducing
resistance. Additionally, tail morphology strongly influenced the oscillation
strategy: designs with larger horizontal surface areas leveraged the
oscillation-reduced shear resistance more effectively by limiting insertion
depth. Based on these findings, we present a design principle to inform tail
action selection based on substrate strength and tail morphology. Our results
offer new insights into tail design and control for improving robot locomotion
on deformable substrates, with implications for agricultural robotics, search
and rescue, and environmental exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve natural human-agent communication in physically situated settings by integrating non-verbal communication modes such as gestures.

Method: A small motion capture dataset is employed to train a motor control policy using imitation and reinforcement learning, enabling accurate and naturalistic gesture generation.

Result: The proposed system outperforms supervised learning and retrieval baselines in terms of naturalness and referential accuracy, as proven through objective metrics and a virtual reality user study.

Conclusion: Imitation and reinforcement learning show promise for generating communicative gestures in robots and intelligent agents, facilitating better human-agent interaction.

Abstract: One of the main goals of robotics and intelligent agent research is to enable
natural communication with humans in physically situated settings. While recent
work has focused on verbal modes such as language and speech, non-verbal
communication is crucial for flexible interaction. We present a framework for
generating pointing gestures in embodied agents by combining imitation and
reinforcement learning. Using a small motion capture dataset, our method learns
a motor control policy that produces physically valid, naturalistic gestures
with high referential accuracy. We evaluate the approach against supervised
learning and retrieval baselines in both objective metrics and a virtual
reality referential game with human users. Results show that our system
achieves higher naturalness and accuracy than state-of-the-art supervised
models, highlighting the promise of imitation-RL for communicative gesture
generation and its potential application to robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for robots to adapt their control models in real-time to unstructured environments using function encoders and recursive least squares, improving safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots face challenges in unstructured environments, especially with sudden terrain changes causing dynamics shifts that can destabilize control systems.

Method: The method involves leveraging function encoders combined with recursive least squares for real-time adaptation, enabling constant-time updates based on streaming odometry without using gradient-based updates.

Result: The approach was validated on a Van der Pol system, in Unity simulations, and on a Clearpath Jackal robot under various terrain conditions. It showed improved model accuracy, better planning, and fewer collisions compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: This paper's method effectively improves autonomous robot control in dynamic and unpredictable environments, demonstrating practical benefits in accuracy and safety.

Abstract: Autonomous robots must go from zero prior knowledge to safe control within
seconds to operate in unstructured environments. Abrupt terrain changes, such
as a sudden transition to ice, create dynamics shifts that can destabilize
planners unless the model adapts in real-time. We present a method for online
adaptation that combines function encoders with recursive least squares,
treating the function encoder coefficients as latent states updated from
streaming odometry. This yields constant-time coefficient estimation without
gradient-based inner-loop updates, enabling adaptation from only a few seconds
of data. We evaluate our approach on a Van der Pol system to highlight
algorithmic behavior, in a Unity simulator for high-fidelity off-road
navigation, and on a Clearpath Jackal robot, including on a challenging terrain
at a local ice rink. Across these settings, our method improves model accuracy
and downstream planning, reducing collisions compared to static and
meta-learning baselines.

TL;DR: The study examines pre-trained vision models (PVMs) in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), showing they improve task performance under severe visual domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor generalization of visuomotor policies to novel scene changes in robotic agents using pre-trained vision models (PVMs), particularly in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL).

Method: The authors investigate the impact of PVMs on MBRL under visual domain shifts, testing varying levels of PVM fine-tuning to evaluate generalization and task performance.

Result: In scenarios with severe visual shifts, PVMs significantly outperform models trained from scratch, with partially fine-tuned PVMs achieving the best results in extreme distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The results establish the utility of PVMs in MBRL for improving robustness and generalization in robotic learning, advocating for their broader adoption.

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is
derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and
vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel
visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy
network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent
developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is
more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has
found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness
in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show
that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline
model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying
levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can
maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in
promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence
for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes KORR, a framework for improving imitation learning by integrating Koopman operator theory to refine residual policies, improving performance and generalization in long-horizon robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision control due to compounding errors, and existing residual policy methods lack a global perspective on state evolution.

Method: The authors propose using Koopman operator theory to impose a linear time-invariant structure in the learned latent space, guiding residual policy updates with global dynamics understanding through their KORR framework.

Result: KORR was tested on robotic furniture assembly tasks and showed improved performance, robustness, and generalization under diverse perturbations compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating Koopman-based modeling into residual policy learning bridges classical control theory with modern learning techniques, improving robustness and generalization in imitation learning tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying resource-intensive VLA models on constrained platforms, aiming to optimize performance and efficiency through token pruning.

Method: LightVLA uses dynamic queries to evaluate the importance of visual tokens and employs Gumbel softmax for differentiable token selection, enabling adaptive and performance-driven pruning during model fine-tuning.

Result: LightVLA achieves a 59.1% reduction in FLOPs, 38.2% lower latency, and a 2.9% improvement in task success rate compared to existing models and pruning methods on the LIBERO benchmark.

Conclusion: LightVLA sets a precedent in applying adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks for both efficiency and performance, highlighting its potential for advancing real-time robotic system capabilities.

Abstract: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

### [334] [ActiveVLN: Towards Active Exploration via Multi-Turn RL in Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12618)
*Zekai Zhang,Weiye Zhu,Hewei Pan,Xiangchen Wang,Rongtao Xu,Xing Sun,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ActiveVLN, a Vision-and-Language Navigation framework emphasizing active exploration via reinforcement learning (RL), achieving improved performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing VLN methods, specifically their dependency on expensive data collection and expert trajectories, and their constraints in engaging in open-ended active exploration.

Method: The proposed ActiveVLN consists of two stages: bootstrapping with imitation learning (IL) using a small set of expert trajectories, followed by iterative trajectory exploration and optimization using an RL-based GRPO objective, enhanced by dynamic early-stopping strategies.

Result: ActiveVLN demonstrates significant performance improvements over IL baseline methods and outperforms both DAgger-based and prior RL-based techniques, achieving results competitive with state-of-the-art methods using smaller models.

Conclusion: Active exploration through RL can effectively address the challenges in VLN tasks, providing a cost-efficient and performance-effective alternative to traditional methods. ActiveVLN holds promise for furthering advancements in the domain.

Abstract: The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow
natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.
Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and
often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While
effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training
costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,
prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend
on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended
active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and
plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose
ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through
multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is
used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively
predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and
optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL
efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail
or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.
Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL
baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training
methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art
approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PerchMobi^3, a innovative robot combining aerial flight, ground locomotion, and wall climbing without additional adhesion actuators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal robotic designs are complex, inefficient, and unreliable due to reliance on additional adhesion actuators.

Method: PerchMobi^3 uses quad-fan ducted propulsion for dual roles: aerial thrust and negative-pressure adhesion, integrated with actively driven wheels for seamless mobility.

Result: The feasibility of PerchMobi^3 was validated via experiments that showcased effective ground driving, wall climbing, aerial flight, and transitions among these modes.

Conclusion: PerchMobi^3 proves to be a promising approach for multi-modal robotic mobility, with potential for autonomous and application-specific enhancements.

Abstract: Achieving seamless integration of aerial flight, ground driving, and wall
climbing within a single robotic platform remains a major challenge, as
existing designs often rely on additional adhesion actuators that increase
complexity, reduce efficiency, and compromise reliability. To address these
limitations, we present PerchMobi^3, a quad-fan, negative-pressure,
air-ground-wall robot that implements a propulsion-adhesion power-reuse
mechanism. By repurposing four ducted fans to simultaneously provide aerial
thrust and negative-pressure adhesion, and integrating them with four actively
driven wheels, PerchMobi^3 eliminates dedicated pumps while maintaining a
lightweight and compact design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
quad-fan prototype to demonstrate functional power reuse for multi-modal
locomotion. A modeling and control framework enables coordinated operation
across ground, wall, and aerial domains with fan-assisted transitions. The
feasibility of the design is validated through a comprehensive set of
experiments covering ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial
flight, and cross-mode transitions, demonstrating robust adaptability across
locomotion scenarios. These results highlight the potential of PerchMobi^3 as a
novel design paradigm for multi-modal robotic mobility, paving the way for
future extensions toward autonomous and application-oriented deployment.

Motivation: To address limitations of current safety filters requiring full observability, making them less applicable in real-world robotic tasks.

Method: A combination of dense rollout simulation, sparse re-evaluation at key state transitions, generalized safety factors, and probing actions to tackle uncertainty in robotic manipulation.

Result: The proposed system identified and filtered unsafe trajectories efficiently in simulations of bimanual manipulation tasks with uncertainty in object parameters like mass and friction.

Conclusion: Physics-based sparse safety evaluation offers a scalable and effective approach to improving safety in robotic manipulation under uncertainty.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in dynamic and unstructured environments requires safety
mechanisms that exploit what is known and what is uncertain about the world.
Existing safety filters often assume full observability, limiting their
applicability in real-world tasks. We propose a physics-based safety filtering
scheme that leverages high-fidelity simulation to assess control policies under
uncertainty in world parameters. The method combines dense rollout with nominal
parameters and parallelizable sparse re-evaluation at critical
state-transitions, quantified through generalized factors of safety for stable
grasping and actuator limits, and targeted uncertainty reduction through
probing actions. We demonstrate the approach in a simulated bimanual
manipulation task with uncertain object mass and friction, showing that unsafe
trajectories can be identified and filtered efficiently. Our results highlight
physics-based sparse safety evaluation as a scalable strategy for safe robotic
manipulation under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces UDON‚Äîa neural implicit mapping framework for multi-robot setups that excels under extreme communication challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches to multi-robot mapping struggle under limited communication success rates, leading to performance issues that need resolution for real-world applications.

Method: UDON leverages uncertainty-weighted distributed optimization to manage communication disruptions effectively and enhance mapping reliability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate UDON outperforms baselines, enabling accurate mappings even with communication success rates as low as 1%.

Conclusion: UDON offers a robust solution to the communication challenges in multi-robot mapping, enabling consistent and high-fidelity scene reconstructions.

Abstract: Multi-robot mapping with neural implicit representations enables the compact
reconstruction of complex environments. However, it demands robustness against
communication challenges like packet loss and limited bandwidth. While prior
works have introduced various mechanisms to mitigate communication disruptions,
performance degradation still occurs under extremely low communication success
rates. This paper presents UDON, a real-time multi-agent neural implicit
mapping framework that introduces a novel uncertainty-weighted distributed
optimization to achieve high-quality mapping under severe communication
deterioration. The uncertainty weighting prioritizes more reliable portions of
the map, while the distributed optimization isolates and penalizes mapping
disagreement between individual pairs of communicating agents. We conduct
extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world robot
hardware. We demonstrate that UDON significantly outperforms existing
baselines, maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions and consistent scene
representations even under extreme communication degradation (as low as 1%
success rate).

TL;DR: Moir√©Tac is a visuotactile sensor that combines visual and tactile functionality using dense interference patterns from overlapping micro-gratings. It achieves high accuracy in 6-axis force/torque measurement, contact localization, and object classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visuotactile sensors have limitations in spatial resolution and lack clear force-to-image relationships, necessitating improvement.

Method: The paper introduces Moir√©Tac, employing overlapping micro-gratings to produce moir√© patterns for tactile sensing, and combining these with physics-based and deep spatial features for interpretable 6-axis force/torque measurements through end-to-end learning.

Result: Moir√©Tac achieves R^2 > 0.98 in 6-axis force/torque measurement, enables sensitivity tuning, maintains object classification despite moir√© overlay, and successfully demonstrates its use in robotic dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: The proposed Moir√©Tac sensor demonstrates significant potential for advancing visuotactile sensing with applications in robotics and manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors typically employ sparse marker arrays that limit spatial
resolution and lack clear analytical force-to-image relationships. To solve
this problem, we present \textbf{Moir\'eTac}, a dual-mode sensor that generates
dense interference patterns via overlapping micro-gratings within a transparent
architecture. When two gratings overlap with misalignment, they create moir\'e
patterns that amplify microscopic deformations. The design preserves optical
clarity for vision tasks while producing continuous moir\'e fields for tactile
sensing, enabling simultaneous 6-axis force/torque measurement, contact
localization, and visual perception. We combine physics-based features
(brightness, phase gradient, orientation, and period) from moir\'e patterns
with deep spatial features. These are mapped to 6-axis force/torque
measurements, enabling interpretable regression through end-to-end learning.
Experimental results demonstrate three capabilities: force/torque measurement
with R^2 > 0.98 across tested axes; sensitivity tuning through geometric
parameters (threefold gain adjustment); and vision functionality for object
classification despite moir\'e overlay. Finally, we integrate the sensor into a
robotic arm for cap removal with coordinated force and torque control,
validating its potential for dexterous manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortcomings of existing NAMO solutions which assume ideal conditions, leading to suboptimal and risky decisions in uncertain real-world scenarios.

Method: Integrates uncertainties like observation noise and action failures into decision-making by estimating their impact and optimizing obstacle handling strategies.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments show significant improvements in success rate and time efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: NAMOUnc proves to be a safer and more efficient approach for handling uncertainties in robotics navigation tasks.

Abstract: Navigation among movable obstacles (NAMO) is a critical task in robotics,
often challenged by real-world uncertainties such as observation noise, model
approximations, action failures, and partial observability. Existing solutions
frequently assume ideal conditions, leading to suboptimal or risky decisions.
This paper introduces NAMOUnc, a novel framework designed to address these
uncertainties by integrating them into the decision-making process. We first
estimate them and compare the corresponding time cost intervals for removing
and bypassing obstacles, optimizing both the success rate and time efficiency,
ensuring safer and more efficient navigation. We validate our method through
extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating significant
improvements over existing NAMO frameworks. More details can be found in our

TL;DR: The paper introduces ODiSAR, a Transformer-based digital twin model for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in self-adaptive robots (SARs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-adaptive robots in uncertain environments require robust mechanisms to detect and respond to abnormal behaviors, including OOD cases. Digital twins offer significant potential to address these challenges.

Method: The approach involves a Transformer-based digital twin that predicts SAR states and quantifies uncertainty through reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout. An explainability layer is integrated to link OOD events to SAR states.

Result: The method was tested on industrial robots in office navigation and maritime settings, achieving superior OOD detection metrics: up to 98% AUROC, 96% TNR@TPR95, and 95% F1-score, while offering interpretability.

Conclusion: ODiSAR demonstrated high effectiveness in detecting and providing interpretable diagnostics for OOD events in SARs, making it a valuable tool for enhancing robot adaptation in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Self-adaptive robots (SARs) in complex, uncertain environments must
proactively detect and address abnormal behaviors, including
out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. To this end, digital twins offer a valuable
solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for
OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to
forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout
for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with
predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even
in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an
explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering
insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of
two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another
performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR
behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects
OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance
-- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing
interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the use of smart digital twins powered by generative AI to predict and manage robots' thermal difficulties, ensuring greater operational efficiency and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robot safety and operational efficiency by addressing the issue of thermal saturation, a fundamental requirement for Industry 5.0 and 6.0's demands of resilience, robustness, and human-centric goals.

Method: The paper introduces smart digital twins that use generative AI, specifically variational autoencoders, to predict and anticipate thermally anomalous states and generate uncritical thermal states for robots.

Result: Robots equipped with these smart digital twins can autonomously predict and communicate their thermal feasibility, potentially avoiding productivity loss and ensuring greater safety.

Conclusion: This approach allows robots to self-sustain their operation, improve user experience, and align with the needs of automated thermally feasible tasks in future industries and societies.

Abstract: Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry
4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in
Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in
anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous
anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors
overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots
are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user
experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in
advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their
lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown,
when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories
and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement
after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with
generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage
thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal
difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational
autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the
thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from
emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing robot-assisted dressing systems to improve accessibility and quality of life for individuals with mobility impairments by addressing real-world limitations like arm movements and visual occlusions.

Method: A policy trained in simulation with partial observations is fine-tuned in real-world scenarios using a small dataset and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing, enabling it to adjust to dynamic human arm motions.

Result: The system was evaluated with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials, achieving successful dressing of long-sleeve garments while adapting to various arm movements and outperforming prior methods in task completion and user satisfaction.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements in real-world robot-assisted dressing, enhancing adaptability and user experience, and setting a benchmark for future systems in practical implementations.

Abstract: Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives
of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and
comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging
deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements
throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions
-- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world
applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system
capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as
robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy
trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to
fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal
feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's
adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in
simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human
study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully
dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being
adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior
baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback. Video are available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces NAVMOE, an approach for improved, modular robot navigation across diverse terrains using mixture-of-experts models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of achieving reliable and robust traversability estimation by integrating geometric and semantic knowledge for diverse environments.

Method: NAVMOE utilizes a modular mixture-of-experts model while dynamically weighting terrain-specific experts with a gating network to handle diverse environments.

Result: NAVMOE achieves 81.2% computational cost reduction while maintaining high path quality with less than 2% degradation, demonstrating enhanced efficiency and performance balance.

Conclusion: NAVMOE enables adaptive navigational strategies, improves cross-domain generalization for robots, and offers a scalable, efficient approach for traversability estimation.

Abstract: This paper explores traversability estimation for robot navigation. A key
bottleneck in traversability estimation lies in efficiently achieving reliable
and robust predictions while accurately encoding both geometric and semantic
information across diverse environments. We introduce Navigation via Mixture of
Experts (NAVMOE), a hierarchical and modular approach for traversability
estimation and local navigation. NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models
for specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based
or a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain
types. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based
on the input environment through a gating network. Overall, our approach offers
three advantages: First, NAVMOE enables traversability estimation to adaptively
leverage specialized approaches for different terrains, which enhances
generalization across diverse and unseen environments. Second, our approach
significantly improves efficiency with negligible cost of solution quality by
introducing a training-free lazy gating mechanism, which is designed to
minimize the number of activated experts during inference. Third, our approach
uses a two-stage training strategy that enables the training for the gating
networks within the hybrid MoE method that contains nondifferentiable modules.
Extensive experiments show that NAVMOE delivers a better efficiency and
performance balance than any individual expert or full ensemble across
different domains, improving cross- domain generalization and reducing average
computational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating, with less than a 2% loss in path
quality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes ActOwL, a framework that helps robots understand object ownership by actively asking intelligent questions and using commonsense knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots in homes and offices to accurately interpret ownership in object-related tasks, since visual features alone are insufficient.

Method: The approach uses a probabilistic generative model for selecting efficient ownership-related questions, combined with LLM-based commonsense classification for pre-classifying objects.

Result: In simulations and real-world tests, ActOwL achieved better ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: ActOwL effectively combines active learning with LLM-guided reasoning, enhancing robots' ability to understand ownership for more practical and socially informed interactions.

Abstract: Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object
ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.''
However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To
address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework
that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to
users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that
maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to
improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge
from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared
or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through
experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory
setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy
with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense
reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge
for practical and socially appropriate task execution.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for adaptive landing of quadruped robots on rough terrains combining Trajectory Optimization and Reinforcement Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies focus primarily on flat terrain landing scenarios, which are unrealistic in real-world rough terrains.

Method: The method integrates Trajectory Optimization for generating reference motions and Reinforcement Learning for tracking these motions in rough terrain environments.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate motion tracking and safe landing across various challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: This framework enhances the compliance and adaptability of quadruped robots' landing capabilities in complex terrains.

Abstract: Jumping constitutes an essential component of quadruped robots' locomotion
capabilities, which includes dynamic take-off and adaptive landing. Existing
quadrupedal jumping studies mainly focused on the stance and flight phase by
assuming a flat landing ground, which is impractical in many real world cases.
This work proposes a safe landing framework that achieves adaptive landing on
rough terrains by combining Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement
Learning (RL) together. The RL agent learns to track the reference motion
generated by TO in the environments with rough terrains. To enable the learning
of compliant landing skills on challenging terrains, a reward relaxation
strategy is synthesized to encourage exploration during landing recovery
period. Extensive experiments validate the accurate tracking and safe landing
skills benefiting from our proposed method in various scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing STL methods that rely on rigid pre-defined maps or mobility representations, which falter in unstructured, real-world robotics environments.

Method: The paper proposes S-MSP, a differentiable task and motion planner that uses a structure-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model and a composite loss function to map camera observations and STL specifications to feasible trajectories.

Result: Experiments in simulation of factory-logistics scenarios demonstrate that S-MSP surpasses single-expert baselines in meeting STL requirements and ensuring trajectory feasibility.

Conclusion: S-MSP is a practical, efficient solution for STL-based planning in robotics, enhanced by a rule-based safety filter for improved execution without sacrificing logical correctness.

Abstract: We investigate the task and motion planning problem for Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) specifications in robotics. Existing STL methods rely on pre-defined maps
or mobility representations, which are ineffective in unstructured real-world
environments. We propose the \emph{Structured-MoE STL Planner}
(\textbf{S-MSP}), a differentiable framework that maps synchronized multi-view
camera observations and an STL specification directly to a feasible trajectory.
S-MSP integrates STL constraints within a unified pipeline, trained with a
composite loss that combines trajectory reconstruction and STL robustness. A
\emph{structure-aware} Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model enables horizon-aware
specialization by projecting sub-tasks into temporally anchored embeddings. We
evaluate S-MSP using a high-fidelity simulation of factory-logistics scenarios
with temporally constrained tasks. Experiments show that S-MSP outperforms
single-expert baselines in STL satisfaction and trajectory feasibility. A
rule-based \emph{safety filter} at inference improves physical executability
without compromising logical correctness, showcasing the practicality of the
approach.

Method: The framework uses LLMs with a novel few-shot prompting strategy and spatial concepts to decompose language instructions into subtasks, assigning them to appropriate robots for execution.

Result: The proposed method outperformed random and commonsense-based approaches in task assignments, achieving a 47/50 success rate, and demonstrated effective real-world performance using two mobile robots.

Conclusion: The study showcases the potential of combining LLMs and spatial concepts to optimize multi-robot task planning and execution for natural and complex language instructions.

Abstract: It is crucial to efficiently execute instructions such as "Find an apple and
a banana" or "Get ready for a field trip," which require searching for multiple
objects or understanding context-dependent commands. This study addresses the
challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part
of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site
knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it
by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions
into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel
few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from
ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our
experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments,
outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50).
Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile
manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle
instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready
for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment,
sequential planning, and execution.

*Junlin Song,Antoine Richard,Miguel Olivares-Mendez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the spatial-temporal calibration of visual-inertial systems using a novel and efficient method based on discrete-time state representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current calibration methods rely on continuous-time state representations like B-splines, which are computationally expensive and inefficient for large-scale applications.

Method: Introduce a calibration approach leveraging discrete-time state representation while addressing its inherent weaknesses in temporal calibration.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces computational cost compared to traditional methods while maintaining precision.

Conclusion: The proposed discrete-time calibration technique offers efficiency gains, potentially saving extensive time in large-scale applications, and the code is open-sourced for community benefit.

Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and
autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To
bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal
displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most
existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more
specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise
spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused
by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and
extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of
discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time
state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the
increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial
platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one
minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.
To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be
open-source.

*Antoine L√©nat,Olivier Cheminat,Damien Chablat,Camilo Charron*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the need to understand and model human operator skills in human-machine interaction, especially in the context of Industry 5.0, using cognitive architecture and predicate logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of adapting human operator skills in human-machine interaction while understanding skill adaptation and performance under complex and variable tasks like welding.

Method: Combining Vergnaud's predicate logic with cognitive architectures to represent and analyze operator skills while incorporating cognitive system constraints.

Result: Introduced a framework for comprehensively representing operator skills, highlighting the significance of adapting these skills in dynamic scenarios such as welding.

Conclusion: Understanding and modeling operator skills are crucial for improving human-machine collaboration, particularly in tasks requiring dynamic adjustment, complex cognition, and action.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction is increasingly important in industry, and this
trend will only intensify with the rise of Industry 5.0. Human operators have
skills that need to be adapted when using machines to achieve the best results.
It is crucial to highlight the operator's skills and understand how they use
and adapt them [18]. A rigorous description of these skills is necessary to
compare performance with and without robot assistance. Predicate logic, used by
Vergnaud within Piaget's scheme concept, offers a promising approach. However,
this theory doesn't account for cognitive system constraints, such as the
timing of actions, the limitation of cognitive resources, the parallelization
of tasks, or the activation of automatic gestures contrary to optimal
knowledge. Integrating these constraints is essential for representing agent
skills understanding skill transfer between biological and mechanical
structures. Cognitive architectures models [2] address these needs by
describing cognitive structure and can be combined with the scheme for mutual
benefit. Welding provides a relevant case study, as it highlights the
challenges faced by operators, even highly skilled ones. Welding's complexity
stems from the need for constant skill adaptation to variable parameters like
part position and process. This adaptation is crucial, as weld quality, a key
factor, is only assessed afterward via destructive testing. Thus, the welder is
confronted with a complex perception-decision-action cycle, where the
evaluation of the impact of his actions is delayed and where errors are
definitive. This dynamic underscores the importance of understanding and
modeling the skills of operators.

*Yidan Lu,Rurui Yang,Qiran Kou,Mengting Chen,Tao Fan,Peter Cui,Yinzhao Dong,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces a learning approach enabling proactive humanoid locomotion policies without relying on perception during deployment, validated with robust performance on challenging terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-off in humanoid locomotion between reactive proprioceptive robustness and perception-driven proactivity for real-world applications.

Method: The authors developed a contrastive learning framework to encode environmental information in the policy's latent state, creating an adaptive gait clock for proactive adjustments.

Result: The approach demonstrated success in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, enabling a full-sized humanoid to navigate challenging terrains like 30 cm steps and 26.5¬∞ slopes effectively.

Conclusion: The study resolves the trade-off in locomotion control by blending proprioception with simulated foresight, achieving robust and proactive performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has produced remarkable advances in humanoid
locomotion, yet a fundamental dilemma persists for real-world deployment:
policies must choose between the robustness of reactive proprioceptive control
or the proactivity of complex, fragile perception-driven systems. This paper
resolves this dilemma by introducing a paradigm that imbues a purely
proprioceptive policy with proactive capabilities, achieving the foresight of
perception without its deployment-time costs. Our core contribution is a
contrastive learning framework that compels the actor's latent state to encode
privileged environmental information from simulation. Crucially, this
``distilled awareness" empowers an adaptive gait clock, allowing the policy to
proactively adjust its rhythm based on an inferred understanding of the
terrain. This synergy resolves the classic trade-off between rigid, clocked
gaits and unstable clock-free policies. We validate our approach with zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer to a full-sized humanoid, demonstrating highly robust
locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm high steps and 26.5{\deg}
slopes, proving the effectiveness of our method. Website:

### [352] [GRATE: a Graph transformer-based deep Reinforcement learning Approach for Time-efficient autonomous robot Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12863)
*Haozhan Ni,Jingsong Liang,Chenyu He,Yuhong Cao,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes GRATE, a deep reinforcement learning approach for autonomous robot exploration, using graph transformers and Kalman filters to improve reasoning and path feasibility. It outperforms prior methods in exploration efficiency and has demonstrated real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL-based methods for autonomous robot exploration struggle with limited reasoning on graph-structured data and optimizing for time efficiency during navigation.

Method: The authors introduced GRATE, which uses a Graph Transformer to analyze both local and global features of informative graphs and deploys a Kalman filter for kinodynamically feasible path generation.

Result: GRATE outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by up to 21.5% in distance traveled and 21.3% in exploration time across simulations, with successful real-world validation.

Conclusion: GRATE demonstrates more efficient exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches due to superior graph reasoning and motion feasibility techniques, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous robot exploration (ARE) is the process of a robot autonomously
navigating and mapping an unknown environment. Recent Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making
problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods
often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data.
Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting
RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while
neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph
Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global
contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's
reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a
Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path
is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5%
in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art
conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We
also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper outlines a novel dataset and methodology to generate human-like pointing gestures with robots, focusing on precision and contextual awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic interaction by generating human-like pointing gestures, moving beyond prior work's emphasis on gesture recognition.

Method: A motion capture dataset is created to train reinforcement learning policies that imitate human pointing gestures while optimizing for precision and context-aware dynamics.

Result: Generated pointing behaviors exhibit a balance between task performance and natural human dynamics in simulation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of creating robots capable of context-aware, human-like pointing gestures with high precision.

Abstract: Pointing is a key mode of interaction with robots, yet most prior work has
focused on recognition rather than generation. We present a motion capture
dataset of human pointing gestures covering diverse styles, handedness, and
spatial targets. Using reinforcement learning with motion imitation, we train
policies that reproduce human-like pointing while maximizing precision. Results
show our approach enables context-aware pointing behaviors in simulation,

*Malte Probst,Raphael Wenzel,Monica Dasi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces metrics for Social Robot Navigation (SRN) to evaluate human-robot conflict resolution, building upon a prior responsibility metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of meaningful metrics for evaluating how robots and humans interact, particularly in resolving conflicts in SRN scenarios.

Method: The paper extends a Responsibility metric by adding time normalization to model conflict buildup and introduces an Engagement metric to measure how actions intensify conflicts.

Result: The metrics were tested in simulated scenarios with dyadic, group, and crowd interactions, demonstrating their effectiveness in assessing cooperation and behavior quality.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics provide valuable insights for evaluating human-robot interactions and conflict resolution, though their limitations and design choices are discussed.

Abstract: In Social Robot Navigation (SRN), the availability of meaningful metrics is
crucial for evaluating trajectories from human-robot interactions. In the SRN
context, such interactions often relate to resolving conflicts between two or
more agents. Correspondingly, the shares to which agents contribute to the
resolution of such conflicts are important. This paper builds on recent work,
which proposed a Responsibility metric capturing such shares. We extend this
framework in two directions: First, we model the conflict buildup phase by
introducing a time normalization. Second, we propose the related Engagement
metric, which captures how the agents' actions intensify a conflict. In a
comprehensive series of simulated scenarios with dyadic, group and crowd
interactions, we show that the metrics carry meaningful information about the
cooperative resolution of conflicts in interactions. They can be used to assess
behavior quality and foresightedness. We extensively discuss applicability,
design choices and limitations of the proposed metrics.

### [355] [Spotting the Unfriendly Robot -- Towards better Metrics for Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12912)
*Raphael Wenzel,Malte Probst*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new metrics for evaluating social robot navigation (SRN) algorithms to better measure cooperation and social compliance during human-robot interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for SRN algorithms fail to capture the cooperative behavior between human and robot agents in scenarios where potential conflicts might arise.

Method: Two metrics are proposed: the conflict intensity metric, which quantifies the reduction of conflict, and the responsibility metric, which evaluates which agent took responsibility for conflict resolution.

Result: These metrics successfully assess the quality of human-robot interactions, measuring cooperation and responsibility during conflict resolution.

Conclusion: The work lays the foundation for standardized SRN evaluation methods, improving robot safety, efficiency, and social acceptance in human-centric environments.

Abstract: Establishing standardized metrics for Social Robot Navigation (SRN)
algorithms for assessing the quality and social compliance of robot behavior
around humans is essential for SRN research. Currently, commonly used
evaluation metrics lack the ability to quantify how cooperative an agent
behaves in interaction with humans. Concretely, in a simple frontal approach
scenario, no metric specifically captures if both agents cooperate or if one
agent stays on collision course and the other agent is forced to evade. To
address this limitation, we propose two new metrics, a conflict intensity
metric and the responsibility metric. Together, these metrics are capable of
evaluating the quality of human-robot interactions by showing how much a given
algorithm has contributed to reducing a conflict and which agent actually took
responsibility of the resolution. This work aims to contribute to the
development of a comprehensive and standardized evaluation methodology for SRN,
ultimately enhancing the safety, efficiency, and social acceptance of robots in
human-centric environments.

*Peiwen Yang,Mingquan Jiang,Xinyue Shen,Heping Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a teaching-free spatiotemporal calibration method for laser vision sensors using line constraints to address desynchronization and parameter drift issues during robot-assisted welding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laser vision sensors in industrial robots face two critical issues: temporal desynchronization due to camera communication delay and variations in hand-eye extrinsic parameters over time, which compromise welding accuracy.

Method: The authors developed a measurement model considering camera time-offset and introduced a calibration method that involves scanning straight-line fillet welds with S-shaped trajectories. They established a nonlinear optimization model based on line constraints and used the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to refine calibration parameters.

Result: Experimental validations on curved weld scanning demonstrated the approach's feasibility and accuracy. Results indicate that the method effectively resolves synchronization and calibration challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration method improves the reliability of laser vision sensor systems for robotic welding applications. Open-sourcing the code and datasets ensures reproducibility and broader adoption by the research community.

Abstract: Laser vision sensors (LVS) are critical perception modules for industrial
robots, facilitating real-time acquisition of workpiece geometric data in
welding applications. However, the camera communication delay will lead to a
temporal desynchronization between captured images and the robot motions.
Additionally, hand-eye extrinsic parameters may vary during prolonged
measurement. To address these issues, we introduce a measurement model of LVS
considering the effect of the camera's time-offset and propose a teaching-free
spatiotemporal calibration method utilizing line constraints. This method
involves a robot equipped with an LVS repeatedly scanning straight-line fillet
welds using S-shaped trajectories. Regardless of the robot's orientation
changes, all measured welding positions are constrained to a straight-line,
represented by Plucker coordinates. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization model
based on straight-line constraints is established. Subsequently, the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is employed to optimize parameters,
including time-offset, hand-eye extrinsic parameters, and straight-line
parameters. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach are
quantitatively validated through experiments on curved weld scanning. We

TL;DR: This paper introduces an underactuated hand with tendon-based proprioception using SEAs for enhanced grasp functionalities without relying on vision or tactile feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for compact sensing integration and interpretation in underactuated hands for effective and practical grasp functionalities.

Method: An anthropomorphic underactuated hand is developed with SEAs for compact sensing, enabling estimation of various grasp-related variables using proprioception and potential energy models.

Result: The system successfully reconstructs grasp postures, handles deformable objects, and recognizes objects with different geometries and stiffnesses in experiments and demonstrations.

Conclusion: Tendon-based proprioception is a reliable and compact sensing solution for practical manipulation in underactuated hands, eliminating the necessity for vision or tactile sensors.

Abstract: Anthropomorphic underactuated hands are widely employed for their versatility
and structural simplicity. In such systems, compact sensing integration and
proper interpretation aligned with underactuation are crucial for realizing
practical grasp functionalities. This study proposes an anthropomorphic
underactuated hand that achieves comprehensive situational awareness of
hand-object interaction, utilizing tendon-based proprioception provided by
series elastic actuators (SEAs). We developed a compact SEA with high accuracy
and reliability that can be seamlessly integrated into sensorless fingers. By
coupling proprioceptive sensing with potential energy-based modeling, the
system estimates key grasp-related variables, including contact timing, joint
angles, relative object stiffness, and finger configuration changes indicating
external disturbances. These estimated variables enable grasp posture
reconstruction, safe handling of deformable objects, and blind grasping with
proprioceptive-only recognition of objects with varying geometry and stiffness.
Finger-level experiments and hand-level demonstrations confirmed the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that
tendon-based proprioception serves as a compact and robust sensing modality for
practical manipulation without reliance on vision or tactile feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing vision-based docking methods, which require robots to have strict initial positioning, by proposing a new end-to-end approach.

Method: The authors developed an innovative method (DVDP) leveraging a binocular RGB-D camera and end-to-end machine learning, supported by a large-scale dataset created via virtual and real environments.

Result: The DVDP method outperforms other approaches in experiments using new evaluation metrics. Deployment on SCOUT Mini demonstrates its capacity to create physical-constraint-compliant docking trajectories.

Conclusion: DVDP represents a significant advancement in the field of automatic docking, providing a cost-effective, precise, and highly adaptable solution for mobile robots.

Abstract: Automatic docking has long been a significant challenge in the field of
mobile robotics. Compared to other automatic docking methods, visual docking
methods offer higher precision and lower deployment costs, making them an
efficient and promising choice for this task. However, visual docking methods
impose strict requirements on the robot's initial position at the start of the
docking process. To overcome the limitations of current vision-based methods,
we propose an innovative end-to-end visual docking method named DVDP(direct
visual docking policy). This approach requires only a binocular RGB-D camera
installed on the mobile robot to directly output the robot's docking path,
achieving end-to-end automatic docking. Furthermore, we have collected a
large-scale dataset of mobile robot visual automatic docking dataset through a
combination of virtual and real environments using the Unity 3D platform and
actual mobile robot setups. We developed a series of evaluation metrics to
quantify the performance of the end-to-end visual docking method. Extensive
experiments, including benchmarks against leading perception backbones adapted
into our framework, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.
Finally, real-world deployment on the SCOUT Mini confirmed DVDP's efficacy,
with our model generating smooth, feasible docking trajectories that meet
physical constraints and reach the target pose.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decentralized method for multi-robot teams to perform persistent monitoring in highly dynamic environments, showing it outperforms other approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust, adaptable, and scalable solutions for persistent monitoring in fields like security and disaster recovery, especially in environments with dynamic traversability, drives the research.

Method: The authors developed a decentralized, on-line method for monitoring and adapting to environmental dynamics in multi-robot patrol scenarios.

Result: Their method outperformed existing realistic baselines in highly dynamic monitoring situations, highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Explicitly accounting for changing environments in some scenarios may not be necessary, but their method shows significant potential for more dynamic use cases.

Abstract: Persistent monitoring using robot teams is of interest in fields such as
security, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. Performing such
monitoring in a fully on-line decentralised fashion has significant potential
advantages for robustness, adaptability, and scalability of monitoring
solutions, including, in principle, the capacity to effectively adapt in
real-time to a changing environment. We examine this through the lens of
multi-robot patrol, in which teams of patrol robots must persistently minimise
time between visits to points of interest, within environments where
traversability of routes is highly dynamic. These dynamics must be observed by
patrol agents and accounted for in a fully decentralised on-line manner. In
this work, we present a new method of monitoring and adjusting for environment
dynamics in a decentralised multi-robot patrol team. We demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic
scenarios, and also investigate dynamic scenarios in which explicitly
accounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a robotic hand that surpasses anthropomorphic grasp capabilities while simplifying the design and reducing actuator requirements.

Method: The SABD hand combines the Add/Abd joint of certain digits into one, increasing workspace by 400% and reducing required DoFs, validated through experimental and reinforcement learning-based evaluations.

Result: Experiments show effective grasping for objects with a 200 mm side distance and 86% success in teleoperated trials on YCB objects, including challenging configurations.

Conclusion: The SABD hand enhances stability, versatility, and dexterity without added complexity, making it highly applicable across various domains.

Abstract: This paper presents the SABD hand, a 16-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic hand
that departs from purely anthropomorphic designs to achieve an expanded grasp
envelope, enable manipulation poses beyond human capability, and reduce the
required number of actuators. This is achieved by combining the
adduction/abduction (Add/Abd) joint of digits four and five into a single joint
with a large range of motion. The combined joint increases the workspace of the
digits by 400\% and reduces the required DoFs while retaining dexterity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the combined Add/Abd joint enables the
hand to grasp objects with a side distance of up to 200 mm. Reinforcement
learning-based investigations show that the design enables grasping policies
that are effective not only for handling larger objects but also for achieving
enhanced grasp stability. In teleoperated trials, the hand successfully
performed 86\% of attempted grasps on suitable YCB objects, including
challenging non-anthropomorphic configurations. These findings validate the
design's ability to enhance grasp stability, flexibility, and dexterous
manipulation without added complexity, making it well-suited for a wide range
of applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fast generative method for creating task-specific robot morphologies, showing strong simulation and real-world performance in adapting to diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose robot designs often underperform in specific tasks, and custom designs are costly and slow to develop. This research aims to expedite the creation of task-tailored robots using computational methods.

Method: The authors propose an approach that uses inverse kinematics learning and a fully differentiable framework to design, optimize, and fine-tune robot morphologies, enabling rapid generation of designs.

Result: Tests show the approach generates robots capable of navigating cluttered areas, performing across defined workspaces, and adapting to hardware limits. A real-world test further validates its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method significantly accelerates robot design processes, making it feasible to create optimized solutions for specific environments quickly and efficiently.

Abstract: Although robotic manipulators are used in an ever-growing range of
applications, robot manufacturers typically follow a ``one-fits-all''
philosophy, employing identical manipulators in various settings. This often
leads to suboptimal performance, as general-purpose designs fail to exploit
particularities of tasks. The development of custom, task-tailored robots is
hindered by long, cost-intensive development cycles and the high cost of
customized hardware. Recently, various computational design methods have been
devised to overcome the bottleneck of human engineering. In addition, a surge
of modular robots allows quick and economical adaptation to changing industrial
settings. This work proposes an approach to automatically designing and
optimizing robot morphologies tailored to a specific environment. To this end,
we learn the inverse kinematics for a wide range of different manipulators. A
fully differentiable framework realizes gradient-based fine-tuning of designed
robots and inverse kinematics solutions. Our generative approach accelerates
the generation of specialized designs from hours with optimization-based
methods to seconds, serving as a design co-pilot that enables instant
adaptation and effective human-AI collaboration. Numerical experiments show
that our approach finds robots that can navigate cluttered environments,
manipulators that perform well across a specified workspace, and can be adapted
to different hardware constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our method by setting up a modular robot designed in
simulation that successfully moves through an obstacle course.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), known for its efficiency and planning capability, to multi-robot cooperation, addressing the challenges posed by complex joint dynamics.

Method: The Sequential World Model framework employs independent, sequential agent-wise world models that use sequential communication for collaborative decision-making. Each agent plans based on predictions from other agents, enabling intention sharing and reducing communication needs.

Result: SeqWM outperformed existing model-free and model-based baselines in simulated environments, showing better performance, efficiency, and cooperative behaviors. It was successfully applied to physical quadruped robots.

Conclusion: SeqWM offers an effective means for addressing the complexity of multi-robot cooperation, achieving high performance, efficiency, and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in
robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However,
extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the
complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World
Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into
model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent,
sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint
dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential
communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its
actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables
explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces
communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated
environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing
state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall
performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative
behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM
has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems. Demos and code are available

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-layer control framework combining model predictive control (MPC) and Bayesian optimization (BO) to safely achieve desired intracranial pressure (ICP) modulation using a soft robotic actuator system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better study cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and neurological disorders by developing a precise system for modulating intracranial pressure waveforms.

Method: The method consists of two layers: (1) MPC with a disturbance observer ensures offset-free motor position tracking under safety constraints, and (2) the BO algorithm performs online learning to find motor position trajectories that achieve desired ICP modulations.

processes underlying neurological disorders. A two-layer framework is proposed
to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive
controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking
of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints.
Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor
position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online
learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP
modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a
brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a
previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC
reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and
73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor
position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean
and amplitude.

*Miquel Oller,An Dang,Nima Fazeli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hydroelastic model for tactile sensors to model path-dependent dynamics and enable gradient-based trajectory optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensors' compliance and their role in force-rich robot-object interactions are underexplored.

Method: Developed a non-holonomic hydroelastic model that extends the object's state space to incorporate contact force distributions, enabling gradient-based trajectory optimization.

Result: The model was validated successfully through simulations and real-world experiments, emphasizing the importance of path-dependent dynamics.

Conclusion: The presented model effectively captures complex tactile sensor dynamics and integrates high-resolution feedback with trajectory optimization.

Abstract: Tactile sensors have long been valued for their perceptual capabilities,
offering rich insights into the otherwise hidden interface between the robot
and grasped objects. Yet their inherent compliance -- a key driver of
force-rich interactions -- remains underexplored. The central challenge is to
capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics introduced by these passive-compliant
elements. Here, we present a computationally efficient non-holonomic
hydroelastic model that accurately models path-dependent contact force
distributions and dynamic surface area variations. Our insight is to extend the
object's state space, explicitly incorporating the distributed forces generated
by the compliant sensor. Our differentiable formulation not only accounts for
path-dependent behavior but also enables gradient-based trajectory
optimization, seamlessly integrating with high-resolution tactile feedback. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of simulated and
real-world experiments and highlight the importance of modeling the path
dependence of sensor dynamics.

### [365] [An Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer for Navigation in Dense, Complex Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13132)
*Zhihao Zhang,Chengyang Peng,Minghao Zhu,Ekim Yurtsever,Keith A. Redmill*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer (UWDT), a transformer-based framework for autonomous driving, which handles uncertainty and improves safety and efficiency in complex roundabout scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve decision-making for autonomous vehicles in dense and dynamic environments, specifically addressing the challenges of spatial structure, long-term dependencies, and robustness under uncertainty.

Method: The method integrates bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with transformer-based modeling, using a teacher-student paradigm where predictive uncertainty from a frozen teacher guides the student's learning process via a weighted loss function.

Result: The proposed UWDT outperforms baseline methods in a simulated roundabout environment, demonstrating better performance in terms of reward, lower collision rates, and improved behavioral stability across various traffic densities.

Conclusion: The study concludes that incorporating uncertainty-aware spatial-temporal transformers leads to safer and more effective autonomous driving strategies in complex traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making
systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal
dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel
framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with
transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout
scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare
safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision
Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate
per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student
model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain,
high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk
transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic
densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of
reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that
uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more
efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeraSim-World, a pipeline for generating realistic and diverse safety-critical data for autonomous driving systems using real-world geospatial data and advanced video generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of E2E autonomous driving requires extensive safety-critical data, which is expensive, unsafe, and inefficient to collect from real-world road testing or simulators that suffer from sim-to-real gaps.

Method: TeraSim-World retrieves geospatial data, simulates agent behaviors, creates corner cases through simulated adversities, and uses photorealistic video rendering via the Cosmos-Drive model.

Result: The system produces geographically accurate and photorealistic safety-critical simulation data, enabling scalable training and evaluation of E2E autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: TeraSim-World bridges the gap between real-world and simulation by providing a scalable and realistic data synthesis framework crucial for autonomous driving system development.

Abstract: Safe and scalable deployment of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving requires
extensive and diverse data, particularly safety-critical events. Existing data
are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or
collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents
TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and
geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at
anywhere in the world. Starting from an arbitrary location, TeraSim-World
retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources.
Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and
orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street
views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded
sensor rendering via the frontier video generation model Cosmos-Drive. By
bridging agent and sensor simulations, TeraSim-World provides a scalable and
critical~data synthesis framework for training and evaluation of E2E autonomous
driving systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROOM, a simulation framework for generating realistic training data for bronchoscopy, addressing challenges in acquiring real-world medical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of realistic training and testing environments in bronchoscopy development due to ethical constraints, patient safety concerns, and the need for realistic imaging and physical feedback.

Method: The authors developed ROOM, a simulation framework that uses patient CT scans to create photorealistic, multi-modal sensor data such as RGB images, depth maps, surface normals, optical flow, and point clouds.

Result: The framework's generated data was validated on tasks like pose estimation and depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in helping existing models adapt to medical settings' unique challenges.

Conclusion: ROOM facilitates the generation of large-scale data for diverse medical applications, advancing training, autonomy algorithms, and navigation in bronchoscopy, and the code is openly shared for further use.

Abstract: Continuum robots are advancing bronchoscopy procedures by accessing complex
lung airways and enabling targeted interventions. However, their development is
limited by the lack of realistic training and test environments: Real data is
difficult to collect due to ethical constraints and patient safety concerns,
and developing autonomy algorithms requires realistic imaging and physical
feedback. We present ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), a
comprehensive simulation framework designed for generating photorealistic
bronchoscopy training data. By leveraging patient CT scans, our pipeline
renders multi-modal sensor data including RGB images with realistic noise and
light specularities, metric depth maps, surface normals, optical flow and point
clouds at medically relevant scales. We validate the data generated by ROOM in
two canonical tasks for medical robotics -- multi-view pose estimation and
monocular depth estimation, demonstrating diverse challenges that
state-of-the-art methods must overcome to transfer to these medical settings.
Furthermore, we show that the data produced by ROOM can be used to fine-tune
existing depth estimation models to overcome these challenges, also enabling
other downstream applications such as navigation. We expect that ROOM will
enable large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and
procedural scenarios that are challenging to capture in clinical settings. Code

### [368] [StageACT: Stage-Conditioned Imitation for Robust Humanoid Door Opening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13200)
*Moonyoung Lee,Dong Ki Kim,Jai Krishna Bandi,Max Smith,Aileen Liao,Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi,Shayegan Omidshafiei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: StageACT is a framework for humanoid robots designed to improve door-opening capabilities by addressing challenges posed by partial observability, resulting in significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots need to operate in environments with minimal modifications. Door-opening presents challenges due to partial observability, requiring solutions beyond standard imitation learning to prevent failures.

Method: StageACT employs stage-conditioned imitation learning, integrating task-stage inputs into policies to enhance success rates and robustness in performing actions.

Result: StageACT achieved a 55% success rate for unseen doors in real-world tests on a humanoid robot, doubling the performance of existing baselines.

Conclusion: Stage-conditioned inputs are an efficient and effective solution for improving robot performance in long-horizon tasks like door opening.

Abstract: Humanoid robots promise to operate in everyday human environments without
requiring modifications to the surroundings. Among the many skills needed,
opening doors is essential, as doors are the most common gateways in built
spaces and often limit where a robot can go. Door opening, however, poses
unique challenges as it is a long-horizon task under partial observability,
such as reasoning about the door's unobservable latch state that dictates
whether the robot should rotate the handle or push the door. This ambiguity
makes standard behavior cloning prone to mode collapse, yielding blended or
out-of-sequence actions. We introduce StageACT, a stage-conditioned imitation
learning framework that augments low-level policies with task-stage inputs.
This effective addition increases robustness to partial observability, leading
to higher success rates and shorter completion times. On a humanoid operating
in a real-world office environment, StageACT achieves a 55% success rate on
previously unseen doors, more than doubling the best baseline. Moreover, our
method supports intentional behavior guidance through stage prompting, enabling
recovery behaviors. These results highlight stage conditioning as a lightweight
yet powerful mechanism for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable one-armed legged robots to efficiently perform complex pick-and-place tasks, including collaborative operations, addressing challenges in long-horizon RL tasks for robotics.

Method: The authors developed a hierarchical RL pipeline with a dynamic reward curriculum that gradually guides robots through payload-centered sub-objectives, promoting efficient policy learning. This method supports single- and dual-robot scenarios.

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the approach improves training efficiency by 55% and reduces task execution time by 18.6%. The dual-robot configuration showed effective coordination through autonomous attention shifts.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates significant advancements in task efficiency and collaboration in both simulation and physical experiments with ANYmal D robots, marking the first RL pipeline for comprehensive collaborative pick-and-place tasks using legged manipulators.

Abstract: We present a hierarchical RL pipeline for training one-armed legged robots to
perform pick-and-place (P&P) tasks end-to-end -- from approaching the payload
to releasing it at a target area -- in both single-robot and cooperative
dual-robot settings. We introduce a novel dynamic reward curriculum that
enables a single policy to efficiently learn long-horizon P&P operations by
progressively guiding the agents through payload-centered sub-objectives.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches for long-horizon RL tasks, our method
improves training efficiency by 55% and reduces execution time by 18.6% in
simulation experiments. In the dual-robot case, we show that our policy enables
each robot to attend to different components of its observation space at
distinct task stages, promoting effective coordination via autonomous attention
shifts. We validate our method through real-world experiments using ANYmal D
platforms in both single- and dual-robot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is
the first RL pipeline that tackles the full scope of collaborative P&P with two
legged manipulators.

Conclusion: The drone's innovative design and advanced control improve energy efficiency and operational stability, offering valuable advancements in drone technology.

Abstract: The endurance and energy efficiency of drones remain critical challenges in
their design and operation. To extend mission duration, numerous studies
explored perching mechanisms that enable drones to conserve energy by
temporarily suspending flight. This paper presents a new perching drone that
utilizes an active flexible perching mechanism inspired by the rapid predation
mechanism of the Venus flytrap, achieving perching in less than 100 ms. The
proposed system is designed for high-speed adaptability to the perching
targets. The overall drone design is outlined, followed by the development and
validation of the biomimetic perching structure. To enhance the system
stability, a cascade extended high-gain observer (EHGO) based control method is
developed, which can estimate and compensate for the external disturbance in
real time. The experimental results demonstrate the adaptability of the
perching structure and the superiority of the cascaded EHGO in resisting wind
and perching disturbances.

### [372] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Functional and Maintainable Code in Industrial Settings: A Case Study at ASML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12395)
*Yash Mundhra,Max Valk,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for code generation in proprietary industrial software environments, specifically at ASML, by creating tailored evaluation frameworks and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the suitability and effectiveness of large language models for generating functional and maintainable code in highly specialized and closed industrial software environments.

Method: The authors created a custom evaluation framework and introduced the build@k metric for compiling and integrating LLM-generated code. They assessed various prompting strategies, LLMs designed for general versus coding applications, and the influence of model size using tailored metrics.

Result: Prompting strategies like few-shot learning and chain-of-thought yield better build success rates. Model size significantly affects code quality, while differences between general and code-specific LLMs depend on model families.

Conclusion: Prompting techniques and model scaling are critical for optimizing LLM-generated code in proprietary environments, though differences between general and specialized models are nuanced.

Abstract: Large language models have shown impressive performance in various domains,
including code generation across diverse open-source domains. However, their
applicability in proprietary industrial settings, where domain-specific
constraints and code interdependencies are prevalent, remains largely
unexplored. We present a case study conducted in collaboration with the
leveling department at ASML to investigate the performance of LLMs in
generating functional, maintainable code within a closed, highly specialized
software environment.
  We developed an evaluation framework tailored to ASML's proprietary codebase
and introduced a new benchmark. Additionally, we proposed a new evaluation
metric, build@k, to assess whether LLM-generated code successfully compiles and
integrates within real industrial repositories. We investigate various
prompting techniques, compare the performance of generic and code-specific
LLMs, and examine the impact of model size on code generation capabilities,
using both match-based and execution-based metrics. The findings reveal that
prompting techniques and model size have a significant impact on output
quality, with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting yielding the highest
build success rates. The difference in performance between the code-specific
LLMs and generic LLMs was less pronounced and varied substantially across
different model families.

*Sparsh Gupta,Kamalavasan Kamalakkannan,Maxim Moraru,Galen Shipman,Patrick Diehl*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven workflow that uses large language models (LLMs) to translate legacy Fortran code into portable Kokkos C++ programs, making the code performance-portable across GPU-accelerated architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift toward GPU-accelerated architectures in HPC highlights the need to modernize legacy Fortran code, as many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings. Current manual porting solutions, like Fortran-to-Kokkos, are time-intensive and require high expertise.

Method: The authors proposed a workflow where specialized LLM 'agents' autonomously collaborate on tasks such as translation, validation, compilation, debugging, and optimization of Fortran kernels into Kokkos C++ code.

Result: Benchmark tests were conducted, showing that paid LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) successfully generated functional and optimized Kokkos C++ programs that outperformed Fortran baselines. In contrast, open-source models showed limited success.

Conclusion: The study proves the feasibility of using LLM-driven workflows for autonomously modernizing legacy Fortran codes, enabling scientific applications to achieve performance portability on diverse super computing architectures.

Abstract: Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases
originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance
Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many
accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize
legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance
portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos
porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs)
have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully
autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains
largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse
hardware.
  This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents"
collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize
Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline
modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos
codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and
o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating
optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models
like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes.
  This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos
transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy
scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse
supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic
systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific
and systems-oriented applications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies the concept of Sustainable Software Engineering (SSE) within the financial services industry and identifies gaps in understanding sustainability between organizational levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear and varied definitions of Sustainable Software Engineering (SSE), especially in data-driven and regulated sectors like financial services.

Method: A qualitative case study conducted using interviews and a focus group with 22 employees (higher management and software engineers) in a financial services company.

Result: The study reveals divergence in sustainability perceptions between higher management and developers, with management focusing on technical and economic aspects while developers emphasize human-centric concerns.

Conclusion: There is a disconnect between organizational goals and individual developer needs, necessitating context-sensitive, co-designed solutions for implementing SSE.

Abstract: Sustainable Software Engineering (SSE) is slowly becoming an industry need
for reasons including reputation enhancement, improved profits and more
efficient practices. However, SSE has many definitions, and this is a challenge
for organisations trying to build a common and broadly agreed understanding of
the term. Although much research effort has gone into identifying general SSE
practices, there is a gap in understanding the sustainability needs of specific
organisational contexts, such as financial services, which are highly
data-driven, operate under strict regulatory requirements, and handle millions
of transactions day to day. To address this gap, our research focuses on a
financial services company (FinServCo) that invited us to investigate
perceptions of sustainability in their IT function: how it could be put into
practice, who is responsible for it, and what the challenges are. We conducted
an exploratory qualitative case study using interviews and a focus group with
six higher management employees and 16 software engineers comprising various
experience levels from junior developers to team leaders. Our study found a
clear divergence in how sustainability is perceived between organisational
levels. Higher management emphasised technical and economic sustainability,
focusing on cloud migration and business continuity through data availability.
In contrast, developers highlighted human-centric concerns such as workload
management and stress reduction. Scepticism toward organisational initiatives
was also evident, with some developers viewing them as a PR strategy. Many
participants expressed a preference for a dedicated sustainability team,
drawing analogies to internal structures for security governance. The
disconnect between organisational goals and individual developer needs
highlights the importance of context-sensitive, co-designed interventions.

TL;DR: This paper systematically examines the paradigm of vibe coding, which emphasizes iterative co-design with AI. It explores developers' perceptions, challenges, and practices while proposing a grounded theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limited empirical understanding of vibe coding, a rapidly emerging programming paradigm co-designed with AI that emphasizes flow and experimentation.

Method: Researchers analyzed qualitative data from 190,000 words obtained from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts to construct a grounded qualitative theory.

Result: The study identified AI trust as central to developer flow, co-creation, and delegation. It also highlighted recurring challenges like debugging, latency, and collaboration, and shared best practices to mitigate these issues.

Conclusion: Vibe coding offers unique benefits for developer flow and experimentation but is hindered by several challenges. The findings pave the way for improved AI developer tools and further research in this paradigm.

Abstract: Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly
become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in
AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI
assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront
specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most
focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical
backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it
is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic
qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on
over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and
LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use
it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We
propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on
conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We
find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to
co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We
surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification,
reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also
present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these
challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and
directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates leveraging ensemble learning techniques to enhance LLM-based code vulnerability detection, highlighting promising improvements in detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address inconsistencies in vulnerability detection outcomes by different LLMs or training stages while harnessing their latent complementarity.

Method: Five LLMs were evaluated using three ensemble strategies (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking) and proposed a novel method called Dynamic Gated Stacking (DGS). Experiments included three datasets.

Result: Ensemble methods improved detection results overall, with Boosting being effective for imbalanced datasets and DGS outperforming traditional Stacking in challenging classification scenarios.

Conclusion: Using ensemble methods and the proposed DGS approach enhances vulnerability detection in LLMs, offering insights for more robust detection systems.

Abstract: Code vulnerability detection is crucial for ensuring the security and
reliability of modern software systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have shown promising capabilities in this domain. However, notable
discrepancies in detection results often arise when analyzing identical code
segments across different training stages of the same model or among
architecturally distinct LLMs. While such inconsistencies may compromise
detection stability, they also highlight a key opportunity: the latent
complementarity among models can be harnessed through ensemble learning to
create more robust vulnerability detection systems. In this study, we explore
the potential of ensemble learning to enhance the performance of LLMs in source
code vulnerability detection. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving
five LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, CodeLlama-7B, CodeLlama-13B,
CodeQwen1.5-7B, and StarCoder2-15B), using three ensemble strategies (i.e.,
Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking). These experiments are carried out across
three widely adopted datasets (i.e., Devign, ReVeal, and BigVul). Inspired by
Mixture of Experts (MoE) techniques, we further propose Dynamic Gated Stacking
(DGS), a Stacking variant tailored for vulnerability detection. Our results
demonstrate that ensemble approaches can significantly improve detection
performance, with Boosting excelling in scenarios involving imbalanced
datasets. Moreover, DGS consistently outperforms traditional Stacking,
particularly in handling class imbalance and multi-class classification tasks.
These findings offer valuable insights into building more reliable and
effective LLM-based vulnerability detection systems through ensemble learning.

Result: Academic research focuses on theory and task optimization, while industry prioritizes operability and efficiency. Factors like technological maturity, performance, and cost impede real-world application.

Conclusion: There is a misalignment between academia and industry in UAV-LLM integration. Recommendations to overcome challenges and align research with practice are provided.

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and large language models
(LLMs) has emerged as a research direction of growing interest, with the
potential to address challenges in autonomous decision-making, human-UAV
interaction, and real-time adaptability. However, existing studies have
remained largely in preliminary exploration with a limited understanding of
real-world practice, risking a misalignment between academic research and
practical needs and hindering the translation of results. To examine and
address these potential challenges, we conducted an empirical study of 74
selected papers and 56 public GitHub projects, identified nine task types for
LLMs in UAV systems, and quantified their distribution. Our findings show that
academic research emphasizes theoretical modeling and task optimization with
dispersed attention across tasks. In contrast, industrial projects focus on
flight control, task planning, and human-machine interaction, prioritizing
operability and efficiency. To further capture industry perspectives, we
distributed an online questionnaire. We obtained 52 valid responses: 40.4% of
practitioners have attempted to apply LLMs to UAV tasks. We further identify
factors that impede real-world integration, including technological maturity,
performance, safety, cost, and other considerations. Finally, we highlight
challenges for future development and provide recommendations.

### [379] [LLM-Based Approach for Enhancing Maintainability of Automotive Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12798)
*Nenad Petrovic,Lukasz Mazur,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o to enhance the flexibility of automotive systems through automation, with three case studies targeting updates, interface checking, and architecture modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automotive systems face challenges in flexibility due to time-intensive processes like re-engineering, standardization, compliance, and dealing with diverse hardware and software components.

Method: The methodology revolves around leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4o for automation tasks, demonstrated through three key case studies: updates and compliance, interface compatibility, and architecture suggestions.

Result: The research reveals proof-of-concept implementations for automating processes, showing promise in overcoming flexibility bottlenecks in automotive systems using LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant potential to address long-term automotive challenges associated with system updates, compliance, and architecture improvements, suggesting transformative improvements in flexibility and maintenance efficiencies.

Abstract: There are many bottlenecks that decrease the flexibility of automotive
systems, making their long-term maintenance, as well as updates and extensions
in later lifecycle phases increasingly difficult, mainly due to long
re-engineering, standardization, and compliance procedures, as well as
heterogeneity and numerosity of devices and underlying software components
involved. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) when it comes to the automation of tasks and processes that aim to
increase the flexibility of automotive systems. Three case studies towards
achieving this goal are considered as outcomes of early-stage research: 1)
updates, hardware abstraction, and compliance, 2) interface compatibility
checking, and 3) architecture modification suggestions. For proof-of-concept
implementation, we rely on OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

*Jinfeng Wen,Jianshu Zhao,Zixi Zhu,Xiaomin Zhang,Qi Liang,Ao Zhou,Shangguang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SateLight, a satellite software update framework utilizing containerization, differential strategies, onboard update designs, and fault-tolerant recovery mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is in updating satellite application software efficiently due to heterogeneous applications, restricted bandwidth, and unstable space conditions.

Method: The authors present SateLight, leveraging containerization to standardize updates along with differential, fine-grained reconstruction, and fault-tolerant recovery methods to meet the unique challenges of satellite computing environments.

Result: On simulation, SateLight cuts transmission latency by up to 91.18% while maintaining update correctness at 100%. A real-world case study confirms its applicability.

Conclusion: SateLight is a practical and reliable approach for updating satellite applications, designed to meet the unique constraints of space computing and improve efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Satellite computing is an emerging paradigm that empowers satellites to
perform onboard processing tasks (i.e., \textit{satellite applications}),
thereby reducing reliance on ground-based systems and improving responsiveness.
However, enabling application software updates in this context remains a
fundamental challenge due to application heterogeneity, limited
ground-to-satellite bandwidth, and harsh space conditions. Existing software
update approaches, designed primarily for terrestrial systems, fail to address
these constraints, as they assume abundant computational capacity and stable
connectivity.
  To address this gap, we propose SateLight, a practical and effective
satellite application update framework tailored for satellite computing.
SateLight leverages containerization to encapsulate heterogeneous applications,
enabling efficient deployment and maintenance. SateLight further integrates
three capabilities: (1) a content-aware differential strategy that minimizes
communication data volume, (2) a fine-grained onboard update design that
reconstructs target applications, and (3) a layer-based fault-tolerant recovery
mechanism to ensure reliability under failure-prone space conditions.
Experimental results on a satellite simulation environment with 10
representative satellite applications demonstrate that SateLight reduces
transmission latency by up to 91.18% (average 56.54%) compared to the best
currently available baseline. It also consistently ensures 100% update
correctness across all evaluated applications. Furthermore, a case study on a
real-world in-orbit satellite demonstrates the practicality of our approach.

*Aamer Aljagthami,Mohammed Banabila,Musab Alshehri,Mohammed Kabini,Mohammad D. Alahmadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Large language models outperform traditional tools like TransCoder for source-code translation, with prompt design and language significantly impacting translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Source-code translation is crucial for software migration, maintenance, and interoperability. Understanding how models and prompts influence translation quality across multiple programming languages is underexplored.

Method: The paper benchmarks multiple LLMs and TransCoder, comparing translation quality among C++, Java, Python, and C# using BLEU and CodeBLEU metrics. It tests two prompt styles‚Äîconcise instructions and detailed specifications‚Äîin both English and Arabic.

Result: Detailed prompts consistently enhance translation quality across models. English prompts outperform Arabic by 13-15%. The highest-performing LLM surpasses traditional tools in challenging translation tasks like Java to C# and Python to C++.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering and language choice are critical to optimizing source-code translation, offering actionable advice for improving software modernization processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated source-code
translation, a capability critical to software migration, maintenance, and
interoperability. Yet comparative evidence on how model choice, prompt design,
and prompt language shape translation quality across multiple programming
languages remains limited. This study conducts a systematic empirical
assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs for code translation among C++, Java,
Python, and C#, alongside a traditional baseline (TransCoder). Using BLEU and
CodeBLEU, we quantify syntactic fidelity and structural correctness under two
prompt styles (concise instruction and detailed specification) and two prompt
languages (English and Arabic), with direction-aware evaluation across language
pairs. Experiments show that detailed prompts deliver consistent gains across
models and translation directions, and English prompts outperform Arabic by
13-15%. The top-performing model attains the highest CodeBLEU on challenging
pairs such as Java to C# and Python to C++. Our evaluation shows that each LLM
outperforms TransCoder across the benchmark. These results demonstrate the
value of careful prompt engineering and prompt language choice, and provide
practical guidance for software modernization and cross-language
interoperability.

*≈ûtefan-Claudiu Susan,Andrei Arusoaie,Dorel Lucanu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new detection pipeline for Solidity smart contract vulnerabilities, combining static analysis, LLMs, and execution methods to reduce false alarms and improve verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high rate of false alarms in current vulnerability detection methods for Solidity smart contracts makes manual verification burdensome and inefficient.

Method: The authors integrate custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge into a pipeline to detect vulnerabilities, cross-validate them using symbolic or concrete execution, and generate proofs.

Result: The pipeline shows promising results in detecting seven types of critical defects, including reentrancy and faulty access control policies, reducing false positives significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances automated smart contract auditing by combining heuristic analysis with formal verification, though challenges like the cost and inconsistency of LLMs remain.

Abstract: The high rate of false alarms from static analysis tools and Large Language
Models (LLMs) complicates vulnerability detection in Solidity Smart Contracts,
demanding methods that can formally or empirically prove the presence of
defects. This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates
custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is
designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform
experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We
demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three
vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control
Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which
often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the
potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying
such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively
validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification
burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency
and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining
heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and
automated smart contract auditing.

*Youngkyoung Kim,Sanghyeok Park,Misoo Kim,Gangho Yoon,Eunseok Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents Progressive Knowledge Enhancement (PKE), a framework for improving large language models (LLMs) performance in generating low-level equipment code, achieving notable improvements on an industrial dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semiconductor programming relies on low-level equipment languages like ALPG, which are difficult to program due to their syntax and learning curve. Existing LLMs struggle to effectively generate such code.

Method: The paper introduces Progressive Knowledge Enhancement (PKE), a multi-stage prompting framework that progressively extracts latent knowledge from LLMs through increasingly complex examples, without requiring extensive fine-tuning.

Result: Using an industrial ALPG dataset, the PKE framework outperformed standard prompting and other state-of-the-art techniques, achieving 11.1% and 15.2% higher exact match scores, respectively.

Conclusion: PKE significantly enhances LLM capabilities for low-level programming tasks, offering a practical solution to improve productivity in semiconductor software development.

Abstract: Semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics, with their
manufacturing and testing relying on highly specialized equipment and
domain-specific programming languages. Equipment languages such as the
Algorithmic Pattern Generator (ALPG) are critical for precise hardware control
but are challenging to program due to their low-level syntax and steep learning
curve. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
high-level code from natural language, their effectiveness on low-level
equipment languages remains limited. To address this, we propose Progressive
Knowledge Enhancement (PKE), a novel multi-stage prompting framework that
progressively extracts and activates the latent knowledge within LLMs, guiding
them from simple to complex examples without extensive fine-tuning. Empirical
evaluation on an industrial ALPG dataset shows that PKE significantly
outperforms standard prompting and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
generating correct ALPG code, achieving 11.1\% and 15.2\% higher exact match
scores compared to the second-best technique. Further analysis of individual
components confirms that progressive knowledge extraction based on difficulty
enhances accuracy. Our study offer a practical approach to boosting LLM
capabilities for specialized low-level programming, supporting greater
productivity in semiconductor software development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a large language model (LLM) tool designed to assist researchers in efficiently conducting Multi Vocal Literature Reviews (MVLRs) without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge researchers face in reviewing large, unstructured, heterogeneous documents for MVLRs, requiring a solution to reduce time and effort.

Method: The study used engineering practices to create an on-premises LLM tool utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. Tool performance was measured using Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and validated through convenience sampling and human judgment.

Result: The developed LLM tool achieved 90% agreement with human researchers when identifying irrelevant sources, demonstrating its effectiveness in streamlining source filtering.

Conclusion: LLM-based tools are effective for supporting rigorous MVLR processes, enabling researchers to focus on higher-level tasks, but researcher engagement remains critical to ensure research integrity.

Abstract: Background: Conducting Multi Vocal Literature Reviews (MVLRs) is often time
and effort-intensive. Researchers must review and filter a large number of
unstructured sources, which frequently contain sparse information and are
unlikely to be included in the final study. Our experience conducting an MVLR
on Context-Aware Software Systems (CASS) Testing in the avionics domain
exemplified this challenge, with over 8,000 highly heterogeneous documents
requiring review. Therefore, we developed a Large Language Model (LLM)
assistant to support the search and filtering of documents. Aims: To develop
and validate an LLM based tool that can support researchers in performing the
search and filtering of documents for an MVLR without compromising the rigor of
the research protocol. Method: We applied sound engineering practices to
develop an on-premises LLM-based tool incorporating Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to process candidate sources. Progress towards the aim was
quantified using the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) as the primary metric to
ensure the performance of the LLM based tool. Convenience sampling, supported
by human judgment and statistical sampling, were used to verify and validate
the tool's quality-in-use. Results: The tool currently demonstrates a PPA
agreement with human researchers of 90% for sources that are not relevant to
the study. Development details are shared to support domain-specific adaptation
of the tool. Conclusions: Using LLM-based tools to support academic researchers
in rigorous MVLR is feasible. These tools can free valuable time for
higher-level, abstract tasks. However, researcher participation remains
essential to ensure that the tool supports thorough research.

TL;DR: This paper examines trends and stability in vulnerability patching for Red Hat products between 1999 and 2024, indicating fluctuating patterns and potential stabilization in security debt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing importance of software maintenance and the concept of security debt, aiming to understand vulnerability patching trends over time.

Method: The authors applied time series and segmented regression analysis to examine trends in vulnerable Red Hat products and components.

Result: The study found instability in vulnerability patching trends, with visible breakpoints suggesting that linear trends are not universally applicable. Security debt may show signs of stabilization.

Conclusion: Linear trends only partially explain vulnerability patterns, with signs that growing security debt may be stabilizing in some areas.

Abstract: Motivated by software maintenance and the more recent concept of security
debt, the paper presents a time series analysis of vulnerability patching of
Red Hat's products and components between 1999 and 2024. According to the
results based on segmented regression analysis, the amounts of vulnerable
products and components have not been stable; a linear trend describes many of
the series well. Nor do the amounts align well with trends characterizing
vulnerabilities in general. There are also visible breakpoints indicating that
the linear trend is not universally applicable and that the growing security
debt may be stabilizing.

TL;DR: Investigates combining code embedding techniques and classifiers for Python vulnerability detection, finding BiLSTM with Word2Vec performing the best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of impractical manual software vulnerability detection caused by growing code complexity and scale.

Method: Evaluated Word2Vec, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT embeddings with BiLSTM and CNN classifiers.

Result: BiLSTM with Word2Vec consistently outperformed other combinations, while CNN with GraphCodeBERT showed commendable results.

Conclusion: Optimal embedding-classifier choice is essential; classical Word2Vec with BiLSTM proves effective despite advanced embedding models.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing complexity and scale of source code have
rendered manual software vulnerability detection increasingly impractical. To
address this challenge, automated approaches leveraging machine learning and
code embeddings have gained substantial attention. This study investigates the
optimal combination of code embedding techniques and machine learning
classifiers for vulnerability detection in Python source code. We evaluate
three embedding techniques, i.e., Word2Vec, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT
alongside two deep learning classifiers, i.e., Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While CNN
paired with GraphCodeBERT exhibits strong performance, the BiLSTM model using
Word2Vec consistently achieves superior overall results. These findings suggest
that, despite the advanced architectures of recent models like CodeBERT and
GraphCodeBERT, classical embeddings such as Word2Vec, when used with
sequence-based models like BiLSTM, can offer a slight yet consistent
performance advantage. The study underscores the critical importance of
selecting appropriate combinations of embeddings and classifiers to enhance the
effectiveness of automated vulnerability detection systems, particularly for
Python source code.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the concept and engineering blueprint of AI-native applications, which redefine how software is developed using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of systematic guidance and architectural definition for practitioners working on AI-native applications, a growing area in the software engineering domain.

Method: Authors performed a grey literature review by integrating insights from targeted online searches and analysis of open-source GitHub projects, following a structured protocol of selection and thematic synthesis.

Result: The study identified 106 sources, highlighting AI-native applications' reliance on AI intelligence and their probabilistic nature. Key qualities include reliability and AI-specific observability, with a typical technology stack involving LLM frameworks, vector databases, and observability platforms.

Conclusion: The study offers a dual-layered engineering blueprint for AI-native applications, advancing understanding and best practices in this emerging field.

Abstract: Background: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has given
rise to AI-native applications, a new paradigm in software engineering that
fundamentally redefines how software is designed, developed, and evolved.
Despite their growing prominence, AI-native applications still lack a unified
engineering definition and architectural blueprint, leaving practitioners
without systematic guidance for system design, quality assurance, and
technology selection.
  Objective: This study seeks to establish a comprehensive understanding of
AI-native applications by identifying their defining characteristics, key
quality attributes, and typical technology stacks, as well as by clarifying the
opportunities and challenges they present.
  Method: We conducted a grey literature review, integrating conceptual
perspectives retrieved from targeted Google and Bing searches with practical
insights derived from leading open-source projects on GitHub. A structured
protocol encompassing source selection, quality assessment, and thematic
analysis was applied to synthesize findings across heterogeneous sources.
  Results: We finally identified 106 studies based on the selection criteria.
The analysis reveals that AI-native applications are distinguished by two core
pillars: the central role of AI as the system's intelligence paradigm and their
inherently probabilistic, non-deterministic nature. Critical quality attributes
include reliability, usability, performance efficiency, and AI-specific
observability. In addition, a typical technology stack has begun to emerge,
comprising LLM orchestration frameworks, vector databases, and AI-native
observability platforms. These systems emphasize response quality,
cost-effectiveness, and outcome predictability, setting them apart from
conventional software systems.
  Conclusion: This study is the first to propose a dual-layered engineering

*Julien Brandoit,Damien Ernst,Guillaume Drion,Arthur Fyon*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper presents a method combining deep learning and Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), enabling inference of neuronal ion channel dynamics using only spike recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between neuronal spike timing and ion channel interactions, two critical aspects of understanding neuronal processing.

Method: The method combines deep learning with DICs to interpret ion channel interactions influencing spike timing and generates neuron models replicating observed spike activity.

Result: The approach accurately infers DICs, successfully captures variability in ion channel composition, and operates using only spike recording data.

Conclusion: This novel technique offers a fast, accessible, and effective way to study neuronal ion channel dynamics through open-source software.

Abstract: Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of
neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both
intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of
state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is
controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different
transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion
channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge,
we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool
called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion
channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons
spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times
and then generates populations of "twin" neuron models that replicate the
observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel
composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike
recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface,
making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework combining The Virtual Brain (TVB) for brain dynamics simulation and Cobrawap for model analysis, demonstrating improved brain modeling through precise parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework for accurately simulating whole-brain dynamics by integrating tools to better configure and calibrate mathematical models, addressing the need for realistic neural activity representation at multiple scales.

Method: The authors combined The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform with the Collaborative Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) for parameter tuning and applied them to a human connectome using the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model with both default and tuned configurations.

Result: The tuned model exhibited biologically relevant features like robust alpha-band oscillations, scale-free activity, and spatio-temporal complexity in both spontaneous and evoked dynamics, outperforming the default model.

Conclusion: Integrating TVB with Cobrawap facilitates effective parameter tuning, enabling realistic and biologically informed whole-brain models, paving the way for data-driven calibration and validation.

Abstract: The simulation of whole-brain dynamics should reproduce realistic spontaneous
and evoked neural activity across different scales, including emergent rhythms,
spatio-temporal activation patterns, and macroscale complexity. Once a
mathematical model is selected, its configuration must be determined by
properly setting its parameters. A critical preliminary step in this process is
defining an appropriate set of observables to guide the selection of model
configurations (parameter tuning), laying the groundwork for quantitative
calibration of accurate whole-brain models. Here, we address this challenge by
presenting a framework that integrates two complementary tools: The Virtual
Brain (TVB) platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics, and the Collaborative
Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) for analyzing the simulations using a
set of standardized metrics. We apply this framework to a 998-node human
connectome, using two configurations of the Larter-Breakspear neural mass
model: one with the TVB default parameters, the other tuned using Cobrawap. The
results reveal that the tuned configuration exhibits several biologically
relevant features, absent in the default model for both spontaneous and evoked
dynamics. In response to external perturbations, the tuned model generates
non-stereotyped, complex spatio-temporal activity, as measured by the
perturbational complexity index. In spontaneous activity, it displays robust
alpha-band oscillations, infra-slow rhythms, scale-free characteristics,
greater spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and asymmetric functional connectivity.
This work demonstrates the potential of combining TVB and Cobrawap to guide
parameter tuning and lays the groundwork for data-driven calibration and
validation of accurate whole-brain models.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents PBPK-iPINN, an advanced method integrating physics-informed neural networks to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters and drug concentration profiles for PBPK brain models, emphasizing proper tuning and loss function weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance PBPK modeling, which traditionally relies on mechanistic ODEs but lacks efficient parameter estimation methods, by leveraging PINNs for improved patient- and drug-specific predictions.

Method: PBPK-iPINN combines inverse PINNs with PBPK brain compartment models to solve direct and inverse problems by estimating drug-specific parameters and accurately profiling drug concentrations. Key focus was given to tuning loss function weights and model parameters.

Result: PBPK-iPINN demonstrated improved performance in estimating parameters and drug concentration profiles with careful tuning, outperforming traditional numerical and statistical methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that PBPK-iPINN is effective for drug-specific and patient-specific parameter estimation in PBPK modeling, provided proper adjustment of neural network settings and loss function weights.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) leverage machine learning with
differential equations to solve direct and inverse problems, ensuring
predictions follow physical laws. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
modeling advances beyond classical compartmental approaches by using a
mechanistic, physiology focused framework. A PBPK model is based on a system of
ODEs, with each equation representing the mass balance of a drug in a
compartment, such as an organ or tissue. These ODEs include parameters that
reflect physiological, biochemical, and drug-specific characteristics to
simulate how the drug moves through the body. In this paper, we introduce
PBPK-iPINN, a method to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters
and drug concentration profiles in PBPK brain compartment models using inverse
PINNs. We demonstrate that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct
solution, the loss function components (data loss, initial conditions loss, and
residual loss) must be appropriately weighted, and parameters (including number
of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, learning rate, optimizer,
and collocation points) must be carefully tuned. The performance of the
PBPK-iPINN approach is then compared with established traditional numerical and
statistical methods.

*Zhao Feng,Bicheng Yan,Luanxiao Zhao,Xianda Shen,Renyu Zhao,Wenhao Wang,Fengshou Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: SURGIN is a new zero-shot capable framework for subsurface multiphase flow data assimilation, integrating generative learning with Bayesian inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inversion methods require retraining for new observation configurations, which limits their real-time application. The study aims to overcome this limitation by proposing a framework capable of assimilating unseen monitoring data in real-time.

Method: SURGIN combines a U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) surrogate with a score-based generative model (SGM). The framework uses unconditional SGM for geological prior learning and a differentiable U-FNO surrogate for posterior sampling through a Bayesian approach.

Result: SURGIN accurately infers heterogeneous geological fields, predicts spatiotemporal flow behavior, and quantifies uncertainty across diverse measurement setups, as shown in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: SURGIN introduces an efficient and adaptive approach to inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification, marking a significant advancement in data assimilation for subsurface multiphase flows.

Abstract: We present a direct inverse modeling method named SURGIN, a SURrogate-guided
Generative INversion framework tailed for subsurface multiphase flow data
assimilation. Unlike existing inversion methods that require adaptation for
each new observational configuration, SURGIN features a zero-shot conditional
generation capability, enabling real-time assimilation of unseen monitoring
data without task-specific retraining. Specifically, SURGIN synergistically
integrates a U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) surrogate with a
score-based generative model (SGM), framing the conditional generation as a
surrogate prediction-guidance process in a Bayesian perspective. Instead of
directly learning the conditional generation of geological parameters, an
unconditional SGM is first pretrained in a self-supervised manner to capture
the geological prior, after which posterior sampling is performed by leveraging
a differentiable U-FNO surrogate to enable efficient forward evaluations
conditioned on unseen observations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate
SURGIN's capability to decently infer heterogeneous geological fields and
predict spatiotemporal flow dynamics with quantified uncertainty across diverse

### [393] [On the Fixed Point Property in Reflexive Banach Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13121)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: math.FA

TL;DR: The paper explores fixed point theory in Banach spaces, proposing new quantitative measures and analyzing their implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to resolve whether every reflexive Banach space possesses the fixed point property, a long-standing open question.

Method: The paper introduces metrics like diametral l1 pressure and weighted selection functionals to analyze orbit hull collapse for nonexpansive operators.

Result: It demonstrates that uniformly positive invariants imply the presence of l1 subspaces, thus excluding reflexivity. It also introduces computational routines and provides cases supporting the framework.

Conclusion: This research offers a new quantitative perspective on fixed point problems, highlighting limitations of prior approaches and identifying directions for future investigation.

Abstract: Fixed point theory studies conditions under which nonexpansive maps on Banach
spaces have fixed points. This paper examines the open question of whether
every reflexive Banach space has the fixed point property. After surveying
classical results, we propose a quantitative framework based on diametral l1
pressure and weighted selection functionals, which measure how much an orbit
hull of a fixed point free nonexpansive map can collapse. We prove that if
either invariant is uniformly positive, then the space must contain a copy of
l1 and thus cannot be reflexive. We present finite dimensional certificates,
positive and negative examples, and an x86-64 routine that computes mutual
coherence and a lower bound for the pressure. The paper clarifies why existing
approaches fail and outlines open problems and ethical considerations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network (VPINN) using a Petrov-Galerkin formulation to solve singularly perturbed BVPs and PDEs more effectively than standard VPINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address numerical challenges and improve accuracy in solving singularly perturbed boundary value problems (BVPs) and parabolic PDEs with small parameters.

Method: The approach combines neural network-based trial functions and hat functions for test spaces in a Petrov-Galerkin weak formulation. Localized test functions and interface penalty terms are employed for stability. Automatic differentiation is used to compute source terms.

Result: The proposed VPINN framework achieves significantly higher accuracy (in both $L_2$ and maximum norms) in numerical experiments compared to standard VPINNs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising improvement for solving one-dimensional differential equations, especially singularly perturbed problems.

Abstract: This work proposes a Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network (VPINN)
framework that integrates the Petrov-Galerkin formulation with deep neural
networks (DNNs) for solving one-dimensional singularly perturbed boundary value
problems (BVPs) and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
one or two small parameters. The method adopts a nonlinear approximation in
which the trial space is defined by neural network functions, while the test
space is constructed from hat functions. The weak formulation is constructed
using localized test functions, with interface penalty terms introduced to
enhance numerical stability and accurately capture boundary layers. Dirichlet
boundary conditions are imposed via hard constraints, and source terms are
computed using automatic differentiation. Numerical experiments on benchmark
problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing
significantly improved accuracy in both the $L_2$ and maximum norms compared to
the standard VPINN approach for one-dimensional singularly perturbed
differential equations (SPDEs).

*Anisio P. Santos Junior,Robinson Sabino-Silva,M√°rio Machado Martins,Thulio Marquez Cunha,Murillo G. Carneiro*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel CNN-BiLSTM architecture for COVID-19 detection using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, achieving superior accuracy on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current COVID-19 detection methods like RT-PCR are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, driving the need for cost-effective, quick, and non-invasive alternatives.

Method: The study integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process ATR-FTIR spectral data from saliva samples and compares performance with other machine learning models.

Result: The CNN-BiLSTM model achieves an average accuracy and F1-score of 0.80, outperforming standalone CNN and other state-of-the-art models on a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: CNN-BiLSTM is a more accurate and reliable method for COVID-19 diagnosis using ATR-FTIR spectra of saliva, offering a non-invasive and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare systems
and remains a global health concern, especially with the emergence of new
variants. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered
the gold standard for COVID-19 detection, it is expensive, time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and sensitive to issues with RNA extraction. In this context,
ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis of biofluids offers a reagent-free,
cost-effective alternative for COVID-19 detection. We propose a novel
architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, referred to as
CNN-BiLSTM, to process spectra generated by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and diagnose
COVID-19 from spectral samples. We compare the performance of this architecture
against a standalone CNN and other state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our CNN-BiLSTM model
outperforms all other models, achieving an average accuracy and F1-score of
0.80 on a challenging real-world COVID-19 dataset. The addition of the BiLSTM
layer to the CNN architecture significantly enhances model performance, making
CNN-BiLSTM a more accurate and reliable choice for detecting COVID-19 using
ATR-FTIR spectra of non-invasive saliva samples.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents FusionMAE, a large-scale model leveraging AI to compress and unify diagnostic data in magnetically confined fusion devices. It enhances control and monitoring capabilities while reducing system complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fusion energy development has been hindered by the complexity and uncertain interrelations among numerous diagnostic systems required for plasma monitoring. Integration and simplification of these systems are crucial for advancing fusion technology.

Method: The authors developed FusionMAE, an AI model pre-trained to process data from 88 diagnostic signals through compression-reduction and missing-signal reconstruction mechanisms. This ensures reliable embeddings for diagnostics and controls.

Result: FusionMAE achieves 'virtual backup diagnosis' to infer missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. It also showcases emergent abilities: automatic data analysis, universal diagnostic-control interface, and improved control task performance.

Conclusion: The study introduces the potential for large-scale AI in evolving fusion energy systems by simplifying system interfaces and reducing diagnostic complexity, potentially accelerating fusion reactor operations.

Abstract: In magnetically confined fusion device, the complex, multiscale, and
nonlinear dynamics of plasmas necessitate the integration of extensive
diagnostic systems to effectively monitor and control plasma behaviour. The
complexity and uncertainty arising from these extensive systems and their
tangled interrelations has long posed a significant obstacle to the
acceleration of fusion energy development. In this work, a large-scale model,
fusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the
information from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a
unified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators. Two
mechanisms are proposed to ensure a meaningful embedding: compression-reduction
and missing-signal reconstruction. Upon completion of pre-training, the model
acquires the capability for 'virtual backup diagnosis', enabling the inference
of missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. Furthermore, the model
demonstrates three emergent capabilities: automatic data analysis, universal
control-diagnosis interface, and enhancement of control performance on multiple
tasks. This work pioneers large-scale AI model integration in fusion energy,
demonstrating how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the system interface,
reducing necessary diagnostic systems and optimize operation performance for
future fusion reactors.

### [397] [Power-Dominance in Estimation Theory: A Third Pathological Axis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12691)
*Sri Satish Krishna Chaitanya Bulusu,Mikko Sillanp√§√§*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical framework aiming to optimize estimator design by addressing errors tied to estimator power regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing estimation theories primarily focus on bias-variance trade-offs without accounting for foundational constraints tied to estimator performance.

Method: They introduce classifications for estimators, diagnostics such as the 'safe-zone law', and visual tools like safe-zone maps to simplify and optimize estimator design.

Result: The analysis shows that estimators in the 'power-dominant regime' underperform structurally while safe-zone principles can reformulate estimator design as bounded path optimizations.

Conclusion: The framework paves the way for new methodologies in estimator design, emphasizing practical optimization and reframing the regularization process theoretically.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation theory by introducing
a second-order diagnostic for estimator design. While classical analysis
focuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational
constraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for
both parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist
frameworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power
regimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the
`power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty,
making it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a
`safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps.
One map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating
characteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone
corresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden
`power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This
framework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing
new theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design
philosophies.

*Pratik Nag,Andrew Zammit-Mangion,Ying Sun*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural autoregressive flow (NAF) approach, enabling advanced modeling of nonstationary spatial processes by allowing for complex, high-dimensional warping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in appropriately modeling nonstationary spatial processes, particularly in higher dimensions, due to the difficulty in selecting suitable spatial warping functions.

Method: The authors propose the use of Neural Autoregressive Flows (NAFs), which are powerful invertible mappings, to model and represent nonstationary and anisotropic spatial processes.

Result: Simulation studies demonstrate the superior representational capacity of the NAF-based model compared to traditional spatial process models. The framework's effectiveness is further validated through its application to a 3D Argo Floats dataset.

Conclusion: NAFs provide a robust and versatile tool for modeling complex nonstationary spatial processes, offering practical utility for real-world applications, especially in higher-dimensional spatial domains.

Abstract: Nonstationary spatial processes can often be represented as stationary
processes on a warped spatial domain. Selecting an appropriate spatial warping
function for a given application is often difficult and, as a result of this,
warping methods have largely been limited to two-dimensional spatial domains.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to modeling nonstationary,
anisotropic spatial processes using neural autoregressive flows (NAFs), a class
of invertible mappings capable of generating complex, high-dimensional
warpings. Through simulation studies we demonstrate that a NAF-based model has
greater representational capacity than other commonly used spatial process
models. We apply our proposed modeling framework to a subset of the 3D Argo
Floats dataset, highlighting the utility of our framework in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: The paper develops a comprehensive Bayesian framework for learning Discrete Bayesian Networks (DBNs) with hierarchical priors and novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to handle sparsity and parametric issues in categorical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of data sparsity and parametric assumptions in learning conditional probabilities and graphical structures of DBNs.

Method: The paper introduces hierarchical priors for conditional probabilities, a log-concave concentration parameter distribution, and novel MCMC algorithms (using parallel Langevin proposals), along with two methods for network structure learning.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate accuracy, power, and efficient performance during simulation studies and successfully uncover prognostic network structures from primary breast cancer data.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian methods provide robust tools for learning DBNs, especially in sparse data regimes, and offer significant utility in practical applications such as cancer prognostics.

Abstract: Discrete Bayesian networks (DBNs) provide a broadly useful framework for
modeling dependence structures in multivariate categorical data. There is a
vast literature on methods for inferring conditional probabilities and
graphical structure in DBNs, but data sparsity and parametric assumptions are
major practical issues. In this article, we detail a comprehensive Bayesian
framework for learning DBNs. First, we propose a hierarchical prior for the
conditional probabilities that enables complicated interactions between parent
variables and stability in sparse regimes. We give a novel Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm utilizing parallel Langevin proposals to generate exact
posterior samples, avoiding the pitfalls of variational approximations.
Moreover, we verify that the full conditional distribution of the concentration
parameters is log-concave under mild conditions, facilitating efficient
sampling. We then propose two methods for learning network structures,
including parent sets, Markov blankets, and DAGs, from categorical data. The
first cycles through individual edges each MCMC iteration, whereas the second
updates the entire structure as a single step. We evaluate the accuracy, power,
and MCMC performance of our methods on several simulation studies. Finally, we
apply our methodology to uncover prognostic network structure from primary
breast cancer samples.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an ultra-realistic NIR simulator to test glucose monitoring methods, showing that a simplified Enhanced Beer-Lambert model outperforms deep learning models in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current non-invasive glucose monitors often fail in real-world scenarios due to the negligence of hardware noise, environmental variables, and individual differences in physiology.

Method: The authors developed a near-infrared (NIR) simulator with diverse real-world conditions, such as LED aging, dark noise, temperature, humidity, and melanin variability, and used this to evaluate six glucose monitoring models.

Result: The Beer-Lambert model achieved the best performance with 13.6 mg/dL RMSE and over 93% accuracy with significantly fewer parameters and faster inference time than competing PINNs and shallow deep neural networks.

Conclusion: Simpler physics-based models like Enhanced Beer-Lambert can outperform deep learning approaches in realistic scenarios, and the study provides an open platform for future research on optical glucose sensors.

Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitors often fail outside the lab because existing
datasets ignore hardware noise, environmental drift, and person-to-person
physiology. We introduce the first ultra-realistic near-infrared (NIR)
simulator that injects 12-bit ADC quantisation, +/-0.1% LED ageing, photodiode
dark noise, 15-45 C temperature, 30-90% relative humidity, contact-pressure
variation, Fitzpatrick I-VI melanin, and diurnal glucose excursions (dawn
phenomenon). Using this platform (rho glucose-NIR = 0.21), we benchmark six
methods: Enhanced Beer-Lambert (physics-engineered ridge regression), three
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a selective radiative-transfer PINN,
and a shallow DNN. Beer-Lambert achieves 13.6 mg/dL RMSE, 95.8% Clarke-A and
93.8% +/-15% accuracy with only 56 parameters and 0.01 ms inference,
outperforming the best PINN (14.6 mg/dL) and the SDNN baseline (35.1 mg/dL).
Results overturn the assumption that deeper PINNs dominate and supply an open,
end-to-end reference stack for rapid prototyping of embedded optical glucose
sensors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method utilizing DINOv2, a pretrained vision model, combined with attention-based mechanisms for effective 3D medical image anomaly classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in medical imaging anomaly detection and classification, including limited annotated data, class imbalance, and expensive expert labeling.

Method: The proposed method employs the pretrained DINOv2 model as a feature extractor for 2D slices of 3D brain MRIs. An attention-based mechanism assigns adaptive importance weights to slices and a composite loss function enhances feature separability and consistency.

Result: The framework was validated on the ADNI dataset and a multi-class headache cohort, achieving strong performance in anomaly classification even with limited, imbalanced data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of pretrained 2D foundation models, combined with attention mechanisms, to improve volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and classification in medical imaging are critical for
early diagnosis but remain challenging due to limited annotated data, class
imbalance, and the high cost of expert labeling. Emerging vision foundation
models such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer
generalized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations.
In this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework
tailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging
the self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method
processes individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive
slice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further
address data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised
contrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class
separability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI
dataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong
anomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and
significant class imbalance. Our results highlight the efficacy of utilizing
pretrained 2D foundation models combined with attention-based slice aggregation
for robust volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging. Our implementation
is publicly available at https://github.com/Rafsani/DinoAtten3D.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for ophthalmologists exceeds the workforce availability, causing delays in retinal disease diagnosis and treatment.

Method: AI-based strategies, including multi-modal deep learning, enhanced keyword representation, overcoming RNN limitations, and improved system interpretability.

Result: The proposed methods achieved state-of-the-art performance and were rigorously evaluated using various metrics.

Conclusion: AI automation significantly enhances clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care for retinal diseases.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge
to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the
available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and
treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of
generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation,
which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining
ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal
images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle
patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI
systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis,
reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases.
The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report
generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions
between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive
medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation
enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3)
Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing
long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance
the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust
and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated
using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis
demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by
automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency,
diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

Motivation: Existing methods in chest radiology often ignore patient metadata, which hampers diagnostic accuracy and fairness.

Method: MetaCheX integrates chest X-ray imaging via a CNN with patient metadata processed through a multilayer perceptron, using a shared classifier.

Result: MetaCheX outperformed radiograph-only baselines in diagnostic accuracy on the CheXpert Plus dataset, as evidenced by an increased AUROC.

Conclusion: The integration of metadata improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces algorithmic bias, and enhances model performance across diverse patient groups, making MetaCheX a step forward in clinical AI.

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for chest radiology often neglect patient
metadata, limiting diagnostic accuracy and fairness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MetaCheX, a novel multimodal framework that integrates chest X-ray
images with structured patient metadata to replicate clinical decision-making.
Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone with
metadata processed by a multilayer perceptron through a shared classifier.
Evaluated on the CheXpert Plus dataset, MetaCheX consistently outperformed
radiograph-only baseline models across multiple CNN architectures. By
integrating metadata, the overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly
improved, measured by an increase in AUROC. The results of this study
demonstrate that metadata reduces algorithmic bias and enhances model
generalizability across diverse patient populations. MetaCheX advances clinical
artificial intelligence toward robust, context-aware radiographic disease
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uncertainty quantification methods often rely on a single expert's annotations, neglecting inter-rater variability, which is critical in healthcare applications.

Method: MEGAN uses multiple EDL models trained with diverse ground truths, combining their predictions and uncertainties through a gating network to enhance calibration and prediction reliability.

Result: MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5% reduction in Expected Calibration Error in a large-scale UC clinical trial.

Conclusion: MEGAN not only improves prediction confidence and calibration but also facilitates efficient and consistent clinical processes by supporting uncertainty-guided sample stratification.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential in medical AI.
Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) offers a computationally efficient way to
quantify model uncertainty alongside predictions, unlike traditional methods
such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout and Deep Ensembles (DE). However, all these
methods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for model
training, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To address
this issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates
uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL models
trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies. MEGAN's gating
network optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model,
enhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively
benchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease
severity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore
(MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective
UC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5%
reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification,
reducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and
consistency in UC trials.

*Weiming Feng,Zelin Li,Pan Peng*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces sublinear-time algorithms for estimating solutions to linear systems with diagonally dominant matrices, improving upon prior works by broadening the applicable matrix class and presenting enhanced performance bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently solving large linear systems is crucial due to their widespread application in scientific computing and modeling, yet evaluating specific parts of solutions in sublinear time remains a challenge.

Method: The method involves analyzing a probabilistic recurrence for solutions to linear systems and developing algorithms that provide additive error estimates while reading only a small portion of matrix and vector inputs.

Result: The algorithms achieve sublinear runtime bounds and support broader matrix classes (strictly and non-strictly diagonally dominant), with a proven optimal dependency on matrix parameters.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes prior methods to handle more matrices and achieves optimal runtime, opening up new applications like enhanced opinion estimation in social network models.

Abstract: We study sublinear-time algorithms for solving linear systems $Sz = b$, where
$S$ is a diagonally dominant matrix, i.e., $|S_{ii}| \geq \delta + \sum_{j \ne
i} |S_{ij}|$ for all $i \in [n]$, for some $\delta \geq 0$. We present
randomized algorithms that, for any $u \in [n]$, return an estimate $z_u$ of
$z^*_u$ with additive error $\varepsilon$ or $\varepsilon \lVert
z^*\rVert_\infty$, where $z^*$ is some solution to $Sz^* = b$, and the
algorithm only needs to read a small portion of the input $S$ and $b$. For
example, when the additive error is $\varepsilon$ and assuming $\delta>0$, we
give an algorithm that runs in time $O\left( \frac{\|b\|_\infty^2
S_{\max}}{\delta^3 \varepsilon^2} \log \frac{\| b \|_\infty}{\delta
\varepsilon} \right)$, where $S_{\max} = \max_{i \in [n]} |S_{ii}|$. We also
prove a matching lower bound, showing that the linear dependence on $S_{\max}$
is optimal. Unlike previous sublinear-time algorithms, which apply only to
symmetric diagonally dominant matrices with non-negative diagonal entries, our
algorithm works for general strictly diagonally dominant matrices ($\delta >
0$) and a broader class of non-strictly diagonally dominant matrices $(\delta =
0)$. Our approach is based on analyzing a simple probabilistic recurrence
satisfied by the solution. As an application, we obtain an improved
sublinear-time algorithm for opinion estimation in the Friedkin--Johnsen model.

TL;DR: The research introduces LatentFrag, a solution for fragment-based drug design utilizing contrastive learning to encode protein-fragment interactions effectively, enabling sensitive predictions and superior generative drug design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragment-based drug design faces challenges in the weak and non-specific binding of fragments, necessitating methods for more efficient fragment identification and guided discovery.

Method: The study developed a protein-fragment encoder based on contrastive learning, mapping fragments and protein surfaces in a shared latent space, and introduced LatentFrag for virtual screening and generative fragment design conditioned on protein surfaces.

Result: LatentFrag demonstrated high sensitivity in locating protein-fragment interaction sites, achieved state-of-the-art fragment recovery rates, and provided superior outcomes compared to traditional virtual screening methods at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: LatentFrag advances fragment identification, streamlines generative drug design, and offers effective tools for fragment-driven drug discovery, paving the way for more efficient and practical workflows in ligand design.

Abstract: Fragment-based drug design is a promising strategy leveraging the binding of
small chemical moieties that can efficiently guide drug discovery. The initial
step of fragment identification remains challenging, as fragments often bind
weakly and non-specifically. We developed a protein-fragment encoder that
relies on a contrastive learning approach to map both molecular fragments and
protein surfaces in a shared latent space. The encoder captures
interaction-relevant features and allows to perform virtual screening as well
as generative design with our new method LatentFrag. In LatentFrag, fragment
embeddings and positions are generated conditioned on the protein surface while
being chemically realistic by construction. Our expressive fragment and protein
representations allow location of protein-fragment interaction sites with high
sensitivity and we observe state-of-the-art fragment recovery rates when
sampling from the learned distribution of latent fragment embeddings. Our
generative method outperforms common methods such as virtual screening at a
fraction of its computational cost providing a valuable starting point for
fragment hit discovery. We further show the practical utility of LatentFrag and
extend the workflow to full ligand design tasks. Together, these approaches
contribute to advancing fragment identification and provide valuable tools for
fragment-based drug discovery.

Method: The authors developed DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow Matching-based model, and trained it on diverse protein trajectories to predict long-term dynamics and analyze computational trade-offs.

Result: DeepJump can predict folding pathways, native states, and long-timescale dynamics of proteins, achieving a computational speed-up of $
approx 1000\times$.

Conclusion: DeepJump enables significantly faster and accurate simulation of protein dynamics, thus advancing the routine study of biomolecular motions.

Abstract: Unraveling the dynamical motions of biomolecules is essential for bridging
their structure and function, yet it remains a major computational challenge.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a detailed depiction of
biomolecular motion, but its high-resolution temporal evolution comes at
significant computational cost, limiting its applicability to timescales of
biological relevance. Deep learning approaches have emerged as promising
solutions to overcome these computational limitations by learning to predict
long-timescale dynamics. However, generalizable kinetics models for proteins
remain largely unexplored, and the fundamental limits of achievable
acceleration while preserving dynamical accuracy are poorly understood. In this
work, we fill this gap with DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow
Matching-based model for predicting protein conformational dynamics across
multiple temporal scales. We train DeepJump on trajectories of the diverse
proteins of mdCATH, systematically studying our model's performance in
generalizing to long-term dynamics of fast-folding proteins and characterizing
the trade-off between computational acceleration and prediction accuracy. We
demonstrate the application of DeepJump to ab initio folding, showcasing
prediction of folding pathways and native states. Our results demonstrate that
DeepJump achieves significant $\approx$1000$\times$ computational acceleration
while effectively recovering long-timescale dynamics, providing a stepping
stone for enabling routine simulation of proteins.

### [408] [LEAF: Knowledge Distillation of Text Embedding Models with Teacher-Aligned Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12539)
*Robin Vujanic,Thomas Rueckstiess*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LEAF, a framework for distilling text embedding models that balance performance and efficiency. LEAF enables asymmetric architectures and requires minimal resources for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a lightweight, efficient text embedding model that aligns closely with a larger teacher model, offering high performance in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: LEAF employs knowledge distillation, ensuring alignment between teacher and smaller models, and does not require judgments or hard negatives during training. This model supports small batch sizes and works with black-box models. It was demonstrated on benchmarks using models like leaf-ir and leaf-mt.

Result: The leaf-ir model achieved SOTA results on the BEIR benchmark leaderboard, and the leaf-mt model ranked #1 on the MTEB v2 leaderboard in its size category. The asymmetric mode further improved retrieval performance.

Conclusion: LEAF is a versatile, resource-efficient framework that simplifies training and delivers high-performance text embedding models. Its wide applicability highlights its significance in advancing lightweight architectures.

Abstract: We present LEAF ("Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework"), a knowledge
distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature
is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context
of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures
where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be
served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models
automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these
properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for
them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M
parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using
LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the
public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in
asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is
however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate
its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also
sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its
size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding
model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,
and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and
training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our
models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

### [409] [InfoGain-RAG: Boosting Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Document Information Gain-based Reranking and Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12765)
*Zihan Wang,Zihan Liang,Zhou Shao,Yufei Ma,Huangyu Dai,Ben Chen,Lingtao Mao,Chenyi Lei,Yuqing Ding,Han Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Document Information Gain (DIG), a metric to improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by measuring contributions of documents to answer accuracy. DIG-based algorithms significantly outperform existing methods in document reranking and answer generation across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG frameworks struggle with evaluating the relevance and meaningfulness of retrieved documents for accurate answer generation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing LLM shortcomings.

Method: The authors propose the DIG metric to measure document contribution by comparing LLM answer confidence with and without augmentation, paired with InfoGain-RAG, a new framework leveraging DIG scores to sort and rerank documents for improved retrieval.

Result: The InfoGain-RAG framework demonstrated major performance improvements in benchmarks like NaturalQA, with significant gains in exact match accuracy over naive, self-reflective, and ranking-based RAG frameworks, and even proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: InfoGain-RAG, powered by the DIG metric, offers a practical and reliable solution for enhancing RAG systems by optimally filtering and ranking documents, showing potential for diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,
outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks
often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully
contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter
out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final
performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel
metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct
answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference
of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.
Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to
train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from
exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can
effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones
for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and
benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing
approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on
NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match
accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG
respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary
model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple
applications.

### [410] [Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation via BPE Token-Level Embedding Initialization with LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13179)
*Yushang Zhao,Xinyue Han,Qian Leng,Qianyi Sun,Haotian Lyu,Chengrui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the cold-start issue in recommender systems by creating a novel strategy using subword-level representations derived from Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The cold-start challenge presents difficulties in recommending items or services for new users or items without prior interaction data. Conventional methods often struggle in sparse metadata environments and fail to capture deeper semantic patterns.

Method: The authors propose a novel approach utilizing BPE tokenization and pre-trained LLM embeddings at the token level, to provide detailed and fine-grained semantic representations for unseen entities, enabling recommendations without prior interaction history.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BPE-LLM approach outperforms baseline recommender system methods, achieving higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate metrics on benchmark datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Token-level semantic initialization using subword-aware embeddings offers a robust, generalizable, and interpretable approach, effectively addressing cold-start problems in multilingual and sparse input scenarios, and serves as a lightweight extension for modern recommender systems in zero-shot contexts.

Abstract: The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems,
especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new
users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as
conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment
with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation
strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by
applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language
Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained
token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to
using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can
be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate
recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our
mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over
benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings
show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit
Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same
capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more
interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The
practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight,
but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the
zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.

*Fitsum Sileshi Beyene,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to historical Black newspapers and proposes a layout-aware OCR pipeline specialized for this context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the structural underrepresentation of Black digital archives in AI research, particularly in OCR applications for historical Black newspapers.

Method: The authors utilized synthetic layout generation, pretraining on augmented datasets, and YOLO detector fusion along with annotation-free metrics like Semantic Coherence Score (SCS), Region Entropy (RE), and Textual Redundancy Score (TRS) for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on a dataset of 400 pages from ten historical Black newspaper titles showed improvements in structural diversity and reduced redundancy compared to full-page baselines, albeit with slight coherence trade-offs.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the significance of honoring cultural layout contexts in AI-driven document analysis, advocating for future community-oriented, ethical AI systems for archival purposes.

Abstract: Despite their cultural and historical significance, Black digital archives
continue to be a structurally underrepresented area in AI research and
infrastructure. This is especially evident in efforts to digitize historical
Black newspapers, where inconsistent typography, visual degradation, and
limited annotated layout data hinder accurate transcription, despite the
availability of various systems that claim to handle optical character
recognition (OCR) well. In this short paper, we present a layout-aware OCR
pipeline tailored for Black newspaper archives and introduce an unsupervised
evaluation framework suited to low-resource archival contexts. Our approach
integrates synthetic layout generation, model pretraining on augmented data,
and a fusion of state-of-the-art You Only Look Once (YOLO) detectors. We used
three annotation-free evaluation metrics, the Semantic Coherence Score (SCS),
Region Entropy (RE), and Textual Redundancy Score (TRS), which quantify
linguistic fluency, informational diversity, and redundancy across OCR regions.
Our evaluation on a 400-page dataset from ten Black newspaper titles
demonstrates that layout-aware OCR improves structural diversity and reduces
redundancy compared to full-page baselines, with modest trade-offs in
coherence. Our results highlight the importance of respecting cultural layout
logic in AI-driven document understanding and lay the foundation for future
community-driven and ethically grounded archival AI systems.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: Genome-Factory is a Python library designed for genomic data handling, model tuning, inference, benchmarking, and interpretability, validated across key dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to streamline and unify genomic model development by providing a tool that comprehensively addresses challenges such as data collection, quality control, model tuning, inference, benchmarking, and interpretation.

Method: The method involves introducing Genome-Factory, which includes automated pipelines for genomic workflows, tools for model tuning (full-parameter, low-rank adaptation, adapter-based fine-tuning), embedding extractions, benchmarking interfaces, and biological interpretation using a sparse auto-encoder.

Result: The utility of Genome-Factory is validated in compatibility with diverse models and tuning methods, benchmarking performance, and biological interpretation using DNABERT-2.

Conclusion: Genome-Factory demonstrates end-to-end usability and practical benefits, offering streamlined workflows and enhanced accessibility for genomic analysis.

Abstract: We introduce Genome-Factory, an integrated Python library for tuning,
deploying, and interpreting genomic models. Our core contribution is to
simplify and unify the workflow for genomic model development: data collection,
model tuning, inference, benchmarking, and interpretability. For data
collection, Genome-Factory offers an automated pipeline to download genomic
sequences and preprocess them. It also includes quality control, such as GC
content normalization. For model tuning, Genome-Factory supports three
approaches: full-parameter, low-rank adaptation, and adapter-based fine-tuning.
It is compatible with a wide range of genomic models. For inference,
Genome-Factory enables both embedding extraction and DNA sequence generation.
For benchmarking, we include two existing benchmarks and provide a flexible
interface for users to incorporate additional benchmarks. For interpretability,
Genome-Factory introduces the first open-source biological interpreter based on
a sparse auto-encoder. This module disentangles embeddings into sparse,
near-monosemantic latent units and links them to interpretable genomic features
by regressing on external readouts. To improve accessibility, Genome-Factory
features both a zero-code command-line interface and a user-friendly web
interface. We validate the utility of Genome-Factory across three dimensions:
(i) Compatibility with diverse models and fine-tuning methods; (ii)
Benchmarking downstream performance using two open-source benchmarks; (iii)
Biological interpretation of learned representations with DNABERT-2. These
results highlight its end-to-end usability and practical value for real-world
genomic analysis.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved Step 9 for a lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows, resolving issues in the previous approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the periodicity/support mismatch in the "domain-extension" component of existing windowed-QFT lattice algorithms.

Method: Introduces a pair-shift difference construction to coherently cancel offsets, generate a uniform CRT-coset state, and enforce modular linear relations using QFT.

Result: The new unitary method is fully reversible, efficient (using poly(log M‚ÇÇ) gates), and preserves algorithmic asymptotics while fixing the mismatch issue.

Conclusion: This approach offers a more robust and assumption-light alternative to the existing Step 9, improving its correctness and applicability.

Abstract: We give a simple, fully correct, and assumption-light replacement for the
contested "domain-extension" in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice
algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~\citep{chen2024quantum}. The published
Step~9 suffers from a periodicity/support mismatch. We present a pair-shift
difference construction that coherently cancels all unknown offsets, produces
an exact uniform CRT-coset state over $\mathbb{Z}_{P}$, and then uses the QFT
to enforce the intended modular linear relation. The unitary is reversible,
uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves the algorithm's
asymptotics. Project Page: https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/quantum-lattice.

*Dawei Xiang,Wenyan Xu,Kexin Chu,Zixu Shen,Tianqi Ding,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces PromptSculptor, a multi-agent system to optimize text-to-image (T2I) model prompts, improving image quality via iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models require detailed and refined prompts, which can be tedious and often need multiple user attempts to achieve high-quality results.

Method: The proposed framework uses four specialized agents employing Chain-of-Thought reasoning, self-evaluation, and user feedback integration to refine prompts iteratively.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that PromptSculptor improves image quality, reduces user input iterations, and is compatible with various T2I models.

Conclusion: PromptSculptor streamlines T2I prompt creation and enhances usability, making it valuable for industrial adoption and broader applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has democratized access to powerful
tools such as Text-to-Image models. However, to generate high-quality images,
users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and
context-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor,
a novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization
process. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work
collaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive,
refined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework
effectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To
iteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified
prompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user
feedback for further refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that
PromptSculptor significantly enhances output quality and reduces the number of
iterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover, its model-agnostic design
allows seamless integration with various T2I models, paving the way for
industrial applications.

### [415] [Towards Closing the Performance Gap for Cryptographic Kernels Between CPUs and Specialized Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12494)
*Naifeng Zhang,Sophia Fu,Franz Franchetti*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper aims to close the performance gap between CPUs and ASICs for cryptographic workloads using optimized scalar implementations and a proposed AVX-512 extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving performance parity between general-purpose CPUs and specialized hardware (ASICs) for cryptographic operations.

Method: The authors developed optimized scalar implementations for x86 CPUs, leveraged SIMD instructions, and proposed a multi-word extension (MQX) for AVX-512.

Result: The work achieved significant speedups (38x for NTTs, 62x for BLAS) and reduced the gap with ASICs to 35x using MQX.

Conclusion: With the proposed techniques, CPUs can significantly reduce the performance gap with ASICs, making them competitive for cryptographic workloads, especially for server-grade CPUs.

Abstract: Specialized hardware like application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)
remains the primary accelerator type for cryptographic kernels based on large
integer arithmetic. Prior work has shown that commodity and server-class GPUs
can achieve near-ASIC performance for these workloads. However, achieving
comparable performance on CPUs remains an open challenge. This work
investigates the following question: How can we narrow the performance gap
between CPUs and specialized hardware for key cryptographic kernels like basic
linear algebra subprograms (BLAS) operations and the number theoretic transform
(NTT)?
  To this end, we develop an optimized scalar implementation of these kernels
for x86 CPUs at the per-core level. We utilize SIMD instructions (specifically
AVX2 and AVX-512) to further improve performance, achieving an average speedup
of 38 times and 62 times over state-of-the-art CPU baselines for NTTs and BLAS
operations, respectively. To narrow the gap further, we propose a small AVX-512
extension, dubbed multi-word extension (MQX), which delivers substantial
speedup with only three new instructions and minimal proposed hardware
modifications. MQX cuts the slowdown relative to ASICs to as low as 35 times on
a single CPU core. Finally, we perform a roofline analysis to evaluate the peak
performance achievable with MQX when scaled across an entire multi-core CPU.
Our results show that, with MQX, top-tier server-grade CPUs can approach the
performance of state-of-the-art ASICs for cryptographic workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The IoEV ecosystem faces challenges such as vulnerability to cyberattacks, unreliable battery predictions, and lack of transparent decision-making.

Method: Developing an AAI framework including agents for cyber-threat detection, SoC and SoH estimation, coordinated reasoning, proactive threat mitigation, and resilient forecasting using LLMs.

Result: The proposed AAI framework improves IoEV security and battery prediction accuracy, validated through experiments in various scenarios.

Conclusion: This research establishes a robust framework enhancing trust, security, and performance in IoEV, and releases all datasets, models, and code for public use.

Abstract: The Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) envisions a tightly coupled
ecosystem of electric vehicles (EVs), charging infrastructure, and grid
services, yet it remains vulnerable to cyberattacks, unreliable battery-state
predictions, and opaque decision processes that erode trust and performance. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel Agentic Artificial Intelligence
(AAI) framework tailored for IoEV, where specialized agents collaborate to
deliver autonomous threat mitigation, robust analytics, and interpretable
decision support. Specifically, we design an AAI architecture comprising
dedicated agents for cyber-threat detection and response at charging stations,
real-time State of Charge (SoC) estimation, and State of Health (SoH) anomaly
detection, all coordinated through a shared, explainable reasoning layer;
develop interpretable threat-mitigation mechanisms that proactively identify
and neutralize attacks on both physical charging points and learning
components; propose resilient SoC and SoH models that leverage continuous and
adversarial-aware learning to produce accurate, uncertainty-aware forecasts
with human-readable explanations; and implement a three-agent pipeline, where
each agent uses LLM-driven reasoning and dynamic tool invocation to interpret
intent, contextualize tasks, and execute formal optimizations for user-centric
assistance. Finally, we validate our framework through comprehensive
experiments across diverse IoEV scenarios, demonstrating significant
improvements in security and prediction accuracy. All datasets, models, and
code will be released publicly.

*Siyuan Bao,Ying Shi,Zhiguang Yang,Hanzhou Wu,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel watermarking method for large language models (LLMs) that embeds watermarks into the model's internal parameters and allows extraction under black-box scenarios, addressing limitations in existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking methods for LLMs either reduce generated text quality or require extensive training and white-box access, prompting the need for a more robust, imperceptible, and efficient approach.

Method: The authors manipulate the internal parameters of LLMs to embed watermarks intrinsically while enabling watermark extraction from generated text without accessing the original model.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and feasibility of the proposed watermarking framework, proving its advantage over existing methods.

Conclusion: This work offers a computationally efficient, robust, and imperceptible watermarking technique for LLMs, paving the way for future innovations in watermarking systems.

Abstract: Existing watermarking methods for large language models (LLMs) mainly embed
watermark by adjusting the token sampling prediction or post-processing,
lacking intrinsic coupling with LLMs, which may significantly reduce the
semantic quality of the generated marked texts. Traditional watermarking
methods based on training or fine-tuning may be extendable to LLMs. However,
most of them are limited to the white-box scenario, or very time-consuming due
to the massive parameters of LLMs. In this paper, we present a new watermarking
framework for LLMs, where the watermark is embedded into the LLM by
manipulating the internal parameters of the LLM, and can be extracted from the
generated text without accessing the LLM. Comparing with related methods, the
proposed method entangles the watermark with the intrinsic parameters of the
LLM, which better balances the robustness and imperceptibility of the
watermark. Moreover, the proposed method enables us to extract the watermark
under the black-box scenario, which is computationally efficient for use.
Experimental results have also verified the feasibility, superiority and
practicality. This work provides a new perspective different from mainstream
works, which may shed light on future research.

*Johan Wahr√©us,Ahmed Hussain,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a technique to bypass Large Language Model (LLM) safety mechanisms and demonstrates its effectiveness through improved malicious content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM safety mechanisms are vulnerable to being bypassed using jailbreaking techniques, posing risks in content automation and generation.

Method: The proposed Content Concretization technique uses a two-stage iterative process involving less constrained and higher-tier models for refinements, tested with 350 cybersecurity prompts.

Result: Success Rates for jailbreaking increased from 7% to 62% after three refinement iterations, and refined outputs were rated as more malicious and technically superior.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need to address vulnerabilities in LLM safety frameworks as they can lead to improved and executable harmful code generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for task automation
and content generation, yet their safety mechanisms remain vulnerable to
circumvention through different jailbreaking techniques. In this paper, we
introduce \textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique
that iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete,
executable implementations. CC is a two-stage process: first, generating
initial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models,
then refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary
output and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350
cybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in
jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\% (no refinements) to 62\%
after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\textcent~per
prompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms
that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more
malicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that
generated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal
deployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning. With eventual
improved harmful code generation, these results highlight critical
vulnerabilities in current LLM safety frameworks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMULET, a Python library to evaluate unintended interactions of ML model defenses on security, privacy, and fairness risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address unintended interactions caused by ML defenses, as these may increase risks unrelated to their intended goals, in line with upcoming regulatory frameworks.

Method: AMULET is designed as a modular library with a user-friendly API, incorporating representative attacks, defenses, and metrics for evaluation of risks.

Result: The library is comprehensive, extensible, consistent, and capable of exploring previously unexplored unintended interactions.

Conclusion: AMULET facilitates practitioners and researchers to assess, design, and deploy ML defenses without inadvertently increasing unrelated risks.

Abstract: ML models are susceptible to risks to security, privacy, and fairness.
Several defenses are designed to protect against their intended risks, but can
inadvertently affect susceptibility to other unrelated risks, known as
unintended interactions. Several jurisdictions are preparing ML regulatory
frameworks that require ML practitioners to assess the susceptibility of ML
models to different risks. A library for valuating unintended interactions that
can be used by (a) practitioners to evaluate unintended interactions at scale
prior to model deployment and (b) researchers to design defenses which do not
suffer from an unintended increase in unrelated risks. Ideally, such a library
should be i) comprehensive by including representative attacks, defenses and
metrics for different risks, ii) extensible to new modules due to its modular
design, iii) consistent with a user-friendly API template for inputs and
outputs, iv) applicable to evaluate previously unexplored unintended
interactions. We present AMULET, a Python library that covers risks to
security, privacy, and fairness, which satisfies all these requirements. AMULET
can be used to evaluate unexplored unintended interactions, compare
effectiveness between defenses or attacks, and include new attacks and
defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent generation of insecure code by LLMs presents serious risks in software development, necessitating improved fine-tuning methods for enhancing code security.

Method: Seven parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques were evaluated, along with decoding optimizations such as sampling temperature adjustments; robustness against attacks was tested using the TrojanPuzzle framework.

Result: Prompt-tuning achieved the best results, improving secure code generation to 80.86% and reducing security vulnerabilities by 203,700 per million code snippets, demonstrating consistency across Python and Java.

Conclusion: Prompt-tuning and decoding optimizations offer effective solutions for enhancing secure code generation in LLMs, improving resilience against security threats, and broad applicability across programming languages.

Abstract: Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerate
software development. However, their frequent generation of insecure code
presents serious risks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of seven
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, demonstrating substantial
gains in secure code generation without compromising functionality. Our
research identifies prompt-tuning as the most effective PEFT method, achieving
an 80.86% Overall-Secure-Rate on CodeGen2 16B, a 13.5-point improvement over
the 67.28% baseline. Optimizing decoding strategies through sampling
temperature further elevated security to 87.65%. This equates to a reduction of
approximately 203,700 vulnerable code snippets per million generated. Moreover,
prompt and prefix tuning increase robustness against poisoning attacks in our
TrojanPuzzle evaluation, with strong performance against CWE-79 and CWE-502
attack vectors. Our findings generalize across Python and Java, confirming
prompt-tuning's consistent effectiveness. This study provides essential
insights and practical guidance for building more resilient software systems

*Magnus Wiik Eckhoff,Peter Marius Flydal,Siem Peters,Martin Eian,Jonas Halvorsen,Vasileios Mavroeidis,Gudmund Grov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a graph-based approach to better contextualize and group alerts in Security Operations Centres (SOCs) for improved handling and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security Operations Centres face challenges in processing and understanding massive volumes of security alerts, often lacking effective means for rapid contextualization to distinguish threats.

Method: The paper proposes using graph-based alert groups where nodes are alerts and edges are relationships in time windows. It employs Graph Matching Networks (GMNs) to correlate current alerts with historical incidents.

Result: By grouping related alerts, the graph-based approach allows for analysis at higher abstraction levels, effectively capturing attack steps and facilitating machine learning applications.

Conclusion: The method enhances threat analysis by providing SOC analysts with improved contextualization and insights through historical correlation, enabling more effective response to security alerts.

Abstract: Interpreting the massive volume of security alerts is a significant challenge
in Security Operations Centres (SOCs). Effective contextualisation is
important, enabling quick distinction between genuine threats and benign
activity to prioritise what needs further analysis.This paper proposes a
graph-based approach to enhance alert contextualisation in a SOC by aggregating
alerts into graph-based alert groups, where nodes represent alerts and edges
denote relationships within defined time-windows. By grouping related alerts,
we enable analysis at a higher abstraction level, capturing attack steps more
effectively than individual alerts. Furthermore, to show that our format is
well suited for downstream machine learning methods, we employ Graph Matching
Networks (GMNs) to correlate incoming alert groups with historical incidents,
providing analysts with additional insights.

orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning
on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to
generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We
evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and
AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently
outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of
79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT.
These findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when

*Eyal German,Daniel Samira,Yuval Elovici,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIA-EPT, a novel black-box attack targeting membership leakage in tabular diffusion models, achieving notable results in privacy vulnerability assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of diffusion models generating synthetic tabular data to membership inference attacks, which are underexplored despite significant privacy concerns.

Method: MIA-EPT creates error-based feature vectors using masked and reconstructed attributes, relying solely on the synthetic data output without accessing internal model components.

Result: MIA-EPT demonstrated effectiveness with AUC-ROC scores up to 0.599, and ranked second in the MIDST 2025 competition‚Äôs Black-box Multi-Table track.

Conclusion: Synthetic tabular data generated by diffusion models is not inherently privacy-preserving, as evidenced by substantial membership leakage uncovered by MIA-EPT.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation plays an important role in enabling data sharing,
particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Recent advances
in diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality
tabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive
information. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by
determining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied
in images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains
underexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited
record diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference
Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack
specifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs
errorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target
records, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are
predicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the
generative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to
generalize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate
MIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up
to 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST
2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box
Multi-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%). These results demonstrate that our
method can uncover substantial membership leakage in synthetic tabular data,
challenging the assumption that synthetic data is inherently
privacy-preserving. Our code is publicly available at

### [424] [ScaleDoc: Scaling LLM-based Predicates over Large Document Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12610)
*Hengrui Zhang,Yulong Hui,Yihao Liu,Huanchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScaleDoc, a system for large-scale semantic document filtering that reduces reliance on costly Large Language Model (LLM) operations through a two-phase method and efficiency-focused innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern workloads require semantic understanding for analyzing unstructured documents, which traditional value-based predicates fail to address. Using LLMs for this purpose incurs high inference costs, leading to inefficiency.

Method: ScaleDoc employs a two-phase approach: (1) an offline phase where LLMs generate semantic representations for documents, and (2) an online phase where a lightweight proxy model filters documents, forwarding challenging cases to the LLM. It includes a contrastive-learning framework and an adaptive cascade mechanism for efficiency.

Result: Experiments conducted on three datasets show ScaleDoc achieves a speedup of over 2√ó and reduces LLM usage by up to 85%, making semantic document analysis significantly more efficient.

Conclusion: ScaleDoc effectively enhances efficiency in semantic document analysis via innovative solutions, enabling practical large-scale processing while maintaining accuracy and minimizing resource use.

Abstract: Predicates are foundational components in data analysis systems. However,
modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands
semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given
enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to
unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel
system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline
representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline
phase, \textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations
for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model
on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only
the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore,
\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant
efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy
model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade
mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific
accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that
\textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces
expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\%, making large-scale semantic analysis
practical and efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in solving second-quantized Hamiltonians with scalable and flexible methods, particularly in the context of quantum embedding methods.

Method: Developed a graph transformer-based NQS framework capable of representing arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and integrated an error control mechanism for stable iterative updates.

Result: The method demonstrated excellent accuracy when compared with exact diagonalisation impurity solver results for the Anderson Lattice Model, with computational bottlenecks identified in the sampling of physical observables.

Conclusion: The study highlights the efficiency and reliability of the developed NQS impurity solver while identifying a need for more advanced inference techniques to address computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising approach to solve
second-quantised Hamiltonians, because of their scalability and flexibility. In
this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum
embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA)
framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to
represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control
mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding
loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations
of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the
exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the
computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the
high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop,
rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the
critical need for more efficient inference techniques.

*Sriram S. K. S. Narayanan,Sajad Ahmadi,Javad Mohammadpour Velni,Umesh Vaidya*

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPC-CDF, a novel approach for ensuring safe navigation in nonlinear systems by integrating control density functions into the MPC framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety-critical control challenges in nonlinear dynamical systems and ensure convergence and safety in navigation tasks.

Method: The method incorporates control density functions into a model predictive control framework, leveraging occupancy measures of system trajectories to derive safety-critical controllers.

Result: The approach is validated using a unicycle model and an autonomous underwater vehicle, demonstrating effective safe navigation and avoidance of obstacles.

Conclusion: MPC-CDF provides a promising method for achieving safety-critical control in nonlinear systems, outperforming traditional methods like control barrier functions in certain scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents MPC-CDF, a new approach integrating control density
functions (CDFs) within a model predictive control (MPC) framework to ensure
safety-critical control in nonlinear dynamical systems. By using the dual
formulation of the navigation problem, we incorporate CDFs into the MPC
framework, ensuring both convergence and safety in a discrete-time setting.
These density functions are endowed with a physical interpretation, where the
associated measure signifies the occupancy of system trajectories. Leveraging
this occupancy-based perspective, we synthesize safety-critical controllers
using the proposed MPC-CDF framework. We illustrate the safety properties of
this framework using a unicycle model and compare it with a control barrier
function-based method. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated in the
autonomous safe navigation of an underwater vehicle, which avoids complex and
arbitrary obstacles while achieving the desired level of safety.

*Sel Ly,Kapil Chauhan,Anshuman Singh,Hung Dinh Nguyen*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Neural Process-based model that efficiently solves probabilistic power flow (PPF) problems for variable grid topologies, addressing computational inefficiencies tied to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in existing PPF methods that require re-solving when grid topologies change, especially as grid contingency events increase due to higher renewable energy and electric vehicle integration.

Method: Develop a topology-adaptive approach using the meta-model Neural Process (MMNP), which leverages context-set-based topology representation and conditional distribution techniques to learn solutions under varying topologies.

Result: The proposed MMNP method achieved a maximum L1-relative error norm of 1.11% on the IEEE 9-bus system and 0.77% on the IEEE 118-bus system, showcasing robust and accurate performance for varying topologies.

Conclusion: The topology-adaptive MMNP approach mitigates the computational and modeling limitations of traditional PPF methods, offering an efficient solution for grids experiencing frequent topology changes.

Abstract: The probabilistic power flow (PPF) problem is essential to quantifying the
distribution of the nodal voltages due to uncertain injections. The
conventional PPF problem considers a fixed topology, and the solutions to such
a PPF problem are associated with this topology. A change in the topology might
alter the power flow patterns and thus require the PPF problem to be solved
again. The previous PPF model and its solutions are no longer valid for the new
topology. This practice incurs both inconvenience and computation burdens as
more contingencies are foreseen due to high renewables and a large share of
electric vehicles. This paper presents a novel topology-adaptive approach,
based on the meta-model Neural Process (MMNP), for finding the solutions to PPF
problems under varying N-1 topologies, particularly with one-line failures. By
leveraging context set-based topology representation and conditional
distribution over function learning techniques, the proposed MMNP enhances the
robustness of PPF models to topology variations, mitigating the need for
retraining PPF models on a new configuration. Simulations on an IEEE 9-bus
system and IEEE 118-bus system validate the model's performance. The maximum
%L1-relative error norm was observed as 1.11% and 0.77% in 9-bus and 118-bus,
respectively. This adaptive approach fills a critical gap in PPF methodology in
an era of increasing grid volatility.

*Filippo Fabiani,Andrea Simonetto*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This study examines least squares problems with semidefinite constraints, offering guarantees that enable simplified computations while maintaining eigenvalue accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Least squares problems with semidefinite constraints are computationally intensive, but their simplifications can provide valuable insights without losing spectrum fidelity.

Method: The authors derive finite-sample guarantees for relaxed semidefinite constraints and provide error bounds for approximating solutions, requiring independent, identically distributed samples.

Result: They produce high-confidence bounds that narrow as data samples increase, and establish guarantees on error approximations for gradient descent solutions without semidefinite constraints.

Conclusion: The findings allow practitioners to efficiently approximate solutions to semidefinite least squares problems, with robust error certificates for eigenvalue proximities and gradient descent methods.

Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD)
constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their
optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide
a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the
full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting
solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The
developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data
increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only
requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the
SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the
error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained
with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AoI-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture utilizing high-altitude platforms (HAPs) as intelligent relays between LEO satellites and ground terminals, aiming to improve coverage, reduce latency, and optimize communication dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in remote area communication and emergency connectivity caused by the intermittent coverage and limited communication windows of LEO satellites.

Method: The study formulates a joint optimization problem to minimize the AoI and satellite handover frequency. They introduce a DD3QN-AS algorithm enhanced with diffusion models and state transformer encoders.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to policy-based methods and alternative DRL benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture and algorithm fulfill the dual goals of improving communication reliability across remote areas and optimizing satellite operations in SAGINs.

Abstract: Despite the widespread deployment of terrestrial networks, providing reliable
communication services to remote areas and maintaining connectivity during
emergencies remains challenging. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations
offer promising solutions with their global coverage capabilities and reduced
latency, yet struggle with intermittent coverage and limited communication
windows due to orbital dynamics. This paper introduces an age of information
(AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that
leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO
satellites and ground terminals. Our three-layer design employs hybrid
free-space optical (FSO) links for high-capacity satellite-to-HAP communication
and reliable radio frequency (RF) links for HAP-to-ground transmission, and
thus addressing the temporal discontinuity in LEO satellite coverage while
serving diverse user priorities. Specifically, we formulate a joint
optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the AoI and satellite handover
frequency through optimal transmit power distribution and satellite selection
decisions. This highly dynamic, non-convex problem with time-coupled
constraints presents significant computational challenges for traditional
approaches. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel diffusion model
(DM)-enhanced dueling double deep Q-network with action decomposition and state
transformer encoder (DD3QN-AS) algorithm that incorporates transformer-based
temporal feature extraction and employs a DM-based latent prompt generative
module to refine state-action representations through conditional denoising.
Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach
compared with policy-based methods and some other deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inequity created by CanLII's limitations on bulk and programmatic access to Canadian legal data, which disproportionately benefits well-resourced actors while disadvantaging the broader public.

Method: Development of the A2AJ Canadian Legal Data project that provides open access to court decisions and statutes through APIs, machine learning datasets, and AI integration protocols.

Result: A database of 116,000+ court decisions and 5,000 statutes accessible via multiple technological formats, promoting broader accessibility and innovative legal applications.

Conclusion: Open legal data empowers equitable access to justice, facilitates evidence-based legal assessments, and fosters innovation for serving underserved communities.

Abstract: The Access to Algorithmic Justice project (A2AJ) is an open-source
alternative to the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII). At a moment
when technology promises to enable new ways of working with law, CanLII is
becoming an impediment to the free access of law and access to justice
movements because it restricts bulk and programmatic access to Canadian legal
data. This means that Canada is staring down a digital divide: well-resourced
actors have the best new technological tools and, because CanLII has disclaimed
leadership, the public only gets second-rate tools. This article puts CanLII in
its larger historical context and shows how long and deep efforts to
democratize access to Canadian legal data are, and how often they are thwarted
by private industry. We introduce the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data project, which
provides open access to over 116,000 court decisions and 5,000 statutes through
multiple channels including APIs, machine learning datasets, and AI integration

TL;DR: This paper applies reinforcement learning, specifically the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to develop a market-making agent, enhancing its adaptability to complex, real-world market dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to utilize reinforcement learning to create adaptive strategies for market-making, considering real-world complexities such as irregular order timing and volatile price movements.

Method: A simulator-based environment was used to train a Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning agent, incorporating stylized facts like stochastic order quantities and non-stationary conditions.

Result: The agent demonstrated effective performance under non-stationary market conditions, with validation via financial return and risk metrics, rivaling closed-form optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The study concludes that reinforcement learning agents, trained with realistic simulations incorporating domain knowledge, offer a viable approach for market-making even in dynamic and uncertain market environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a promising framework for developing
adaptive and data-driven strategies, enabling market makers to optimize
decision-making policies based on interactions with the limit order book
environment. This paper explores the integration of a reinforcement learning
agent in a market-making context, where the underlying market dynamics have
been explicitly modeled to capture observed stylized facts of real markets,
including clustered order arrival times, non-stationary spreads and return
drifts, stochastic order quantities and price volatility. These mechanisms aim
to enhance stability of the resulting control agent, and serve to incorporate
domain-specific knowledge into the agent policy learning process. Our
contributions include a practical implementation of a market making agent based
on the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, alongside a comparative
evaluation of the agent's performance under varying market conditions via a
simulator-based environment. As evidenced by our analysis of the financial
return and risk metrics when compared to a closed-form optimal solution, our
results suggest that the reinforcement learning agent can effectively be used
under non-stationary market conditions, and that the proposed simulator-based
environment can serve as a valuable tool for training and pre-training
reinforcement learning agents in market-making scenarios.

*Zo√´ J. Gray,Joseph B. Choi,Youngsoo Choi,H. Keo Springer,H. S. Udaykumar,Stephen S. Baek*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve physics-aware deep learning (PADL) for predicting the evolution of complex spatiotemporal fields, using a latent space approach to make models faster and more computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex fields, such as those in energetic materials (EM), is computationally intensive. Simplifying and accelerating PADL for these tasks is crucial for practical applications.

Method: The authors introduce a latent space approach to PARC (Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutions), projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional manifold to encode the evolution of complex field geometry in a more efficient manner.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces training and inference time while producing predictions comparable in accuracy to the standard PARC approach.

Conclusion: By leveraging latent space representations, the research advances efficient and scalable predictions for thermomechanics in energetic materials, paving the way for larger-scale applications and linking structure, properties, and performance.

Abstract: Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex
spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise
frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show
that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution
problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks:
learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics
over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this,
we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC).
PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network
architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical
fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as
the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation
scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a
microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and
reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a
lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent
representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g.
temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced
dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the
initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a
significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results
comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid
prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM
structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.

Motivation: To address the limitations of centralized MLOps and existing compute platforms, and to lower barriers for AI deployment.

Method: The paper introduces a blockchain-based protocol combining Proof-of-Availability and Proof-of-AI consensus with components like dAuth, CSTORE, R1FS, EDIL, Deeploy, and OracleSync.

Result: The proposed system improves accessibility, scalability, and security for decentralized AI pipelines and apps.

Conclusion: Ratio1 demonstrates significant advantages over current platforms in terms of efficiency, trust, and accessibility.

Abstract: We propose the Ratio1 AI meta-operating system (meta-OS), a decentralized
MLOps protocol that unifies AI model development, deployment, and inference
across heterogeneous edge devices. Its key innovation is an integrated
blockchain-based framework that transforms idle computing resources (laptops,
smartphones, cloud VMs) into a trustless global supercomputer. The architecture
includes novel components: a decentralized authentication layer (dAuth), an
in-memory state database (CSTORE), a distributed storage system (R1FS),
homomorphic encrypted federated learning (EDIL), decentralized container
orchestration (Deeploy) and an oracle network (OracleSync), which collectively
ensure secure, resilient execution of AI pipelines and other container based
apps at scale. The protocol enforces a formal circular token-economic model
combining Proof-of-Availability (PoA) and Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus.
Compared to centralized heterogeneous cloud MLOps and existing decentralized
compute platforms, which often lack integrated AI toolchains or trusted Ratio1
node operators (R1OP) mechanics, Ratio1's holistic design lowers barriers for
AI deployment and improves cost-efficiency. We provide mathematical
formulations of its secure licensing and reward protocols, and include
descriptive information for the system architecture and protocol flow. We argue

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: UrgenGo improves GPU task deadline adherence in autonomous vehicles through urgency-aware scheduling, reducing deadline misses by 61% without needing source code access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary autonomous driving systems and closed-source GPU drivers limit control over GPU execution, leading to missed task deadlines and compromised reliability.

Method: Developed UrgenGo, a non-intrusive GPU scheduling system using kernel launch manipulation, stream binding, delayed launches, and batched synchronization, without requiring source code access.

Result: UrgenGo achieved a 61% reduction in deadline miss ratio in real-world testing on a self-driving bus, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: UrgenGo offers a practical, source-code-independent solution for enhancing GPU scheduling in autonomous vehicle systems, demonstrating substantial performance improvements.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in autonomous driving have introduced increasingly
complex, real-time GPU-bound tasks critical for reliable vehicle operation.
However, the proprietary nature of these autonomous systems and closed-source
GPU drivers hinder fine-grained control over GPU executions, often resulting in
missed deadlines that compromise vehicle performance. To address this, we
present UrgenGo, a non-intrusive, urgency-aware GPU scheduling system that
operates without access to application source code. UrgenGo implicitly
prioritizes GPU executions through transparent kernel launch manipulation,
employing task-level stream binding, delayed kernel launching, and batched
kernel launch synchronization. We conducted extensive real-world evaluations in
collaboration with a self-driving startup, developing 11 GPU-bound task chains
for a realistic autonomous navigation application and implementing our system
on a self-driving bus. Our results show a significant 61% reduction in the
overall deadline miss ratio, compared to the state-of-the-art GPU scheduler
that requires source code modifications.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: SamudrACE is a coupled global climate model emulator providing long-term, high-resolution simulations while maintaining low climate biases and realistic variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance climate modeling by leveraging machine learning, ensuring stability and realistic climate variability for coupled phenomena like ENSO.

Method: Machine learning-based emulation of individual Earth system components, coupled through spatial and temporal boundary alignment.

Result: SamudrACE delivers centuries-long simulations with 1-degree horizontal and high temporal resolution, producing realistic coupled climate patterns and low biases.

Conclusion: SamudrACE is an effective tool for simulating complex climate interactions, benefiting researchers and complementing traditional models.

Abstract: Traditional numerical global climate models simulate the full Earth system by
exchanging boundary conditions between separate simulators of the atmosphere,
ocean, sea ice, land surface, and other geophysical processes. This paradigm
allows for distributed development of individual components within a common
framework, unified by a coupler that handles translation between realms via
spatial or temporal alignment and flux exchange. Following a similar approach
adapted for machine learning-based emulators, we present SamudrACE: a coupled
global climate model emulator which produces centuries-long simulations at
1-degree horizontal, 6-hourly atmospheric, and 5-daily oceanic resolution, with
145 2D fields spanning 8 atmospheric and 19 oceanic vertical levels, plus sea
ice, surface, and top-of-atmosphere variables. SamudrACE is highly stable and
has low climate biases comparable to those of its components with prescribed
boundary forcing, with realistic variability in coupled climate phenomena such
as ENSO that is not possible to simulate in uncoupled mode.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QDFlow, an open-source physics simulator for generating synthetic data with ground-truth labels for quantum dot arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning approaches for quantum dot devices require labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain experimentally due to labor-intensive labeling and data limitations.

Method: QDFlow integrates a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and noise modules to simulate charge stability diagrams and ray-based data.

Result: QDFlow produces realistic synthetic datasets resembling experimental results and supports customizable noise models and extensive tunable parameters.

Conclusion: QDFlow is a practical tool for accelerated ML development, benchmarking, and quantum dot device research through synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in
calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches
rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training,
benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data.
Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data
availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an
open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic
synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent
Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to
produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling
experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models,
QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development,
benchmarking, and quantum device research.

### [438] [Evolution of Programmers' Trust in Generative AI Programming Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13253)
*Anshul Shah,Thomas Rexin,Elena Tomson,Leo Porter,William G. Griswold,Adalbert Gerald Soosai Raj*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how programmers' trust in GitHub Copilot evolves with short-term and extended use, focusing on computer science students using the tool on challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trust in AI programming assistants influences how programmers utilize them, affecting productivity and outcomes. Over-trust can lead to errors, while under-trust may result in neglecting beneficial tools.

Method: The study involved 71 upper-division computer science students using GitHub Copilot on a legacy code project. It employed surveys to measure changes in trust levels over one hour and ten days, backed by qualitative insights into the reasons for trust changes.

Result: On average, students' trust in Copilot increased with time. However, they recognized the necessity of manual intervention for some tasks. Factors such as Copilot‚Äôs apparent correctness, understanding its use of context, and familiarity with natural language processing elevated trust.

Conclusion: The study offers insights for educators and managers, emphasizing skilled usage of Copilot through challenging tasks, verification skills, natural language processing knowledge, and showcasing the tool's features.

Abstract: Motivation. Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude
that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that
are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or
vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that
can improve their productivity and well-being.
  Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this
study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one
hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data
from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base,
representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study,
we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why
student trust changes.
  Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a
project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent
programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing
Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code
base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to
their elevated trust.
  Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand
the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI
assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS
educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on
challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach
traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can
verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language
processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features
available in Copilot.

### [439] [The Adaptation Paradox: Agency vs. Mimicry in Companion Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12525)
*T. James Brandt,Cecilia Xi Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Generative AI-based chatbots face challenges in fostering genuine connections. A study found that avatar generation improves user rapport, while adaptive Language Style Matching (LSM) paradoxically reduces perception of adaptability and satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unsettled principles for fostering authentic human connection in companion chatbots powered by generative AI.

Method: A preregistered 3x2 experimental design with 162 participants tested user-controlled avatar generation (none, premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs. adaptive).

Result: Avatar generation significantly enhanced user rapport, but adaptive LSM performed worse than static LSM in terms of personalization and satisfaction and was perceived as less adaptive.

Conclusion: Visible user authorship fosters natural interaction, while covert mimicry introduces risks of incoherence. Designers should emphasize legible personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry.

Abstract: Generative AI powers a growing wave of companion chatbots, yet principles for
fostering genuine connection remain unsettled. We test two routes: visible user
authorship versus covert language-style mimicry. In a preregistered 3x2
experiment (N = 162), we manipulated user-controlled avatar generation (none,
premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs.
adaptive). Generating an avatar boosted rapport ($\omega^2$ = .040, p = .013),
whereas adaptive LSM underperformed static style on personalization and
satisfaction (d = 0.35, p = .009) and was paradoxically judged less adaptive (t
= 3.07, p = .003, d = 0.48). We term this an Adaptation Paradox: synchrony
erodes connection when perceived as incoherent, destabilizing persona. To
explain, we propose a stability-and-legibility account: visible authorship
fosters natural interaction, while covert mimicry risks incoherence. Our
findings suggest designers should prioritize legible, user-driven
personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a transparent and shareable interpretive process for scholarly interpretation and writing.

Method: The study utilized a co-creative and iterative prototyping design process to develop the Textarium web-based environment.

Result: Textarium merges human analysis and computational methods to enable readers to annotate, group keywords, and visually render interpretive actions.

Conclusion: Textarium bridges close and distant reading practices, making digital interpretive actions accessible and shareable.

Abstract: We present a web-based environment that connects annotation, abstraction, and
argumentation during the interpretation of text. As a visual interface for
scholarly reading and writing, Textarium combines human analysis with
lightweight computational processing to bridge close and distant reading
practices. Readers can highlight text, group keywords into concepts, and embed
these observations as anchors in essays. The interface renders these
interpretive actions as parameterized visualization states. Through a
speculative design process of co-creative and iterative prototyping, we
developed a reading-writing approach that makes interpretive processes
transparent and shareable within digital narratives.

*Tao Long,Xuanming Zhang,Sitong Wang,Zhou Yu,Lydia B Chilton*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DoubleAgents is a transparent and controllable agentic planning tool designed to build user trust through simulation, clear policies, and adaptive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of building trust in agentic workflows by focusing on transparency, controllability, and explainability.

Method: The researchers developed 'DoubleAgents,' which includes user intervention, value-reflecting policies, state visualizations, and uncertainty flagging. The tool incorporates respondent simulation for rehearsal and refinement and was tested in lab studies, real-world deployments, and technical evaluations.

Result: Participants initially hesitated to delegate tasks but became more reliant on the tool as they experienced its features during simulation. Deployment showed the tool's practical relevance and scalability with task complexity.

Conclusion: DoubleAgents enables trust in AI systems through proactive design focused on transparency, control, and simulation-based reliability calibration, contributing to trust-by-design patterns for agentic workflows.

Abstract: Agentic workflows promise efficiency, but adoption hinges on whether people
actually trust systems that act on their behalf. We present DoubleAgents, an
agentic planning tool that embeds transparency and control through user
intervention, value-reflecting policies, rich state visualizations, and
uncertainty flagging for human coordination tasks. A built-in respondent
simulation generates realistic scenarios, allowing users to rehearse, refine
policies, and calibrate their reliance before live use. We evaluate
DoubleAgents in a two-day lab study (n=10), two deployments (n=2), and a
technical evaluation. Results show that participants initially hesitated to
delegate but grew more reliant as they experienced transparency, control, and
adaptive learning during simulated cases. Deployment results demonstrate
DoubleAgents' real-world relevance and usefulness, showing that the effort
required scaled appropriately with task complexity and contextual data. We
contribute trust-by-design patterns and mechanisms for proactive AI --
consistency, controllability, and explainability -- along with simulation as a
safe path to build and calibrate trust over time.

*Axel Wiebe Werner,Jonas Beskow,Anna Deichler*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study evaluates computer-generated gestures in both VR and 2D settings, showing that VR slightly enhances perception, particularly with motion-capture gestures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how immersive virtual reality influences the perception of AI-generated gestures compared to traditional 2D space.

Method: A comparative evaluation of three models from the 2023 GENEA Challenge was conducted, within both VR and 2D environments.

Result: Gestures in VR were rated slightly higher on average, especially motion-capture gestures, while model rankings stayed consistent across formats.

Conclusion: VR enhances the perception of AI-generated gestures and provides unique advantages over traditional 2D evaluation.

Abstract: Gestures are central to human communication, enriching interactions through
non-verbal expression. Virtual avatars increasingly use AI-generated gestures
to enhance life-likeness, yet evaluations have largely been confined to 2D.
Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive alternative that may affect how
gestures are perceived. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
computer-generated gestures in VR and 2D, examining three models from the 2023
GENEA Challenge. Results show that gestures viewed in VR were rated slightly
higher on average, with the strongest effect observed for motion-capture "true
movement." While model rankings remained consistent across settings, VR
influenced participants' overall perception and offered unique benefits over
traditional 2D evaluation.

*David Oprea,David Perkins*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Wave Function Collapse Set Covering (WFC-SC) heuristic, paired with Hill Climbing, for solving the Minimum Set Cover Problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to improve the efficiency and balance between solution quality and computational time for solving the Minimum Set Cover Problem.

Method: They designed WFC-SC using techniques like observation, propagation, and collapsing, and further enhanced it with the Hill Climbing metaheuristic.

Result: The proposed algorithm performs better in terms of optimality and time balance compared to existing methods from Brunel University's OR library.

Conclusion: The WFC-SC algorithm proves to be a competitive and efficient approach to solving the Minimum Set Cover Problem with the help of benchmarking against other algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new heuristic that focuses on the optimization
problem for the Minimum Set Cover Problem. Our new heuristic involves using
Wave Function Collapse and is called Wave Function Collapse Set Covering
(WFC-SC). This algorithm goes through observation, propagation, and collapsing,
which will be explained more later on in this paper. We optimize this algorithm
to quickly find optimal coverings that are close to the minimum needed. To
further optimize this algorithm, we pair it with the Hill Climbing
metaheuristic to help WFC-SC find a better solution than its "local optimum."
We benchmark our algorithm using the well known OR library from Brunel
University against other proficient algorithms. We find that our algorithm has
a better balance between both optimality and time.

*Amin Ghodousian,Sara Zal,Minoo Ahmadi*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper examines an optimization problem constrained by fuzzy relational inequalities using Sugeno-Weber t-norms, proposing an algorithm that guarantees an exact solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving optimization problems constrained by fuzzy relational inequalities effectively and to utilize the powerful Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms/t-conorms.

Method: The paper first examines the feasibility of the problem region under max-Sugeno-Weber composition, provides a necessary and sufficient feasibility condition, and proposes a resolution algorithm based on theoretical properties.

Result: The proposed algorithm is proven to attain the exact optimal solution, and its validity is demonstrated through an example.

Conclusion: The paper successfully formulates the problem, analyzes its feasibility, and provides a reliable solution algorithm, contributing valuable insights to fuzzy modeling and optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a latticized optimization problem with fuzzy
relational inequality constraints where the feasible region is formed as the
intersection of two inequality fuzzy systems and Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms
is considered as fuzzy composition. Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms and
t-conorms is one of the most applied one in various fuzzy modelling problems.
This family of t-norms and t-conorms was suggested by Weber for modeling
intersection and union of fuzzy sets. Also, the t-conorms were suggested as
addition rules by Sugeno for so-called alpha-fuzzy measures. The resolution of
the feasible region of the problem is firstly investigated when it is defined
with max-Sugeno-Weber composition and a necessary and sufficient condition is
presented for determining the feasibility. Then, based on some theoretical
properties of the problem, an algorithm is presented for solving this nonlinear
problem. It is proved that the algorithm can find the exact optimal solution
and an example is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm.

*Santanu Banerjee,Goutam Sen,Siddhartha Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This study tackles an advanced vehicle routing issue for disaster management involving multiple depots, heterogeneous vehicles, and diverse transportation modes. A heuristic algorithm is developed for practical implementation, surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize disaster management logistics to minimize route duration and improve preparedness and response times.

Method: Developed a heuristic algorithm called PSR-GIP that utilizes decision trees and route clustering strategies, combined with perturbation techniques.

Result: The PSR-GIP heuristic demonstrated effective and swift solutions for large-scale practical problems on novel datasets.

Conclusion: The heuristic outperforms MILP formulations, proving its suitability for real-world disaster response decision systems.

Abstract: A rich vehicle routing problem is considered allowing multiple trips of
heterogeneous vehicles stationed at distributed vehicle depots spread across
diverse geographies having access to different modes of transportation. The
problem arises from the real world requirement of optimizing the disaster
response/preparedness time and minimizes the route duration of the vehicles to
achieve the solution with the minimum highest-vehicle-route-duration. Multiple
diversely-functional vertices are considered including the concept of
Transhipment Ports as inter-modal resource transfer stations. Both simultaneous
and split pickup and transferring of different types of delivery and pickup
cargo is considered, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo
Compatibility. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach
is shown over existing makespan minimization approaches through the developed
MILP formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation
within Disaster Management-specific Decision Support Systems, an extensive
Heuristic Algorithm is devised. The Heuristic utilizes Decision Tree based
structuring of possible routes and is able to inherently consider the
compatibility issues. Preferential generation of small route elements are
performed, which are integrated into route clusters; we consider multiple
different logical integration approaches, as well as shuffling the logics to
simultaneously produce multiple independent solutions. Finally perturbation of
the different solutions are done to find better neighbouring solutions. The
computational performance of the PSR-GIP Heuristic, on our created novel
datasets, indicate that it is able to give good solutions swiftly for practical
problems involving large integer instances which the MILP is unable to solve.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper introduces VADER, a probabilistic deep learning model using a variational autoencoder, to infer planetary mass and disk properties from high-resolution protoplanetary disk images. It delivers highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust method for extracting global disk properties and planet mass from high-resolution images of protoplanetary disks, addressing the need for precise, data-intensive astrophysical tools.

Method: Utilized a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on over 100,000 synthetic PPD images simulated via FARGO3D and post-processed with RADMC3D. The model incorporated probabilistic learning for uncertainty-aware predictions.

Result: VADER demonstrated prediction accuracies with $R^2 > 0.9$ on physical parameters and its estimations on real disks align well with extant literature. It also uncovered latent physical correlations in disk data.

Conclusion: The study establishes the utility of VADER as a robust and interpretable tool for astrophysical inference in PPD images, with strong implications for use in large-scale interferometric surveys.

Abstract: We present \textbf{VADER} (Variational Autoencoder for Disks Embedded with
Rings), for inferring both planet mass and global disk properties from
high-resolution ALMA dust continuum images of protoplanetary disks (PPDs).
VADER, a probabilistic deep learning model, enables uncertainty-aware inference
of planet masses, $\alpha$-viscosity, dust-to-gas ratio, Stokes number, flaring
index, and the number of planets directly from protoplanetary disk images.
VADER is trained on over 100{,}000 synthetic images of PPDs generated from
\texttt{FARGO3D} simulations post-processed with \texttt{RADMC3D}. Our trained
model predicts physical planet and disk parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ from dust
continuum images of PPDs. Applied to 23 real disks, VADER's mass estimates are
consistent with literature values and reveal latent correlations that reflect
known disk physics. Our results establish VAE-based generative models as robust
tools for probabilistic astrophysical inference, with direct applications to
interpreting protoplanetary disk substructures in the era of large
interferometric surveys.

*Theodora Moldovan,Arianna Pera,Davide Vega,Luca Maria Aiello*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how activism, specifically the Black Lives Matter movement, is discussed in podcasts by analyzing transcripts to identify emotional and participatory expressions across various activism stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to extend the understanding of collective action and activism discourse to spoken digital formats, as most prior research has been conducted on text-based content.

Method: The authors analyzed podcast transcripts using a layered framework and categorized participatory expressions (problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, execution) while examining emotions using eight categories of emotional contexts.

Result: They found that emotional profiles shifted across different stages of activism, with positive emotions being more present during calls-to-action and execution, while negative emotions were less associated with collective action than theoretically expected.

Conclusion: Activism is articulated differently across emotional profiles and participatory stages in podcasts, and the study highlights how emotional framing depends on the spoken format of discussions.

Abstract: We study how participation in collective action is articulated in podcast
discussions, using the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a case study. While
research on collective action discourse has primarily focused on text-based
content, this study takes a first step toward analyzing audio formats by using
podcast transcripts. Using the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC), we
investigated spoken language expressions of participation in collective action,
categorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution. We
identified podcast episodes discussing racial justice after important
BLM-related events in May and June of 2020, and extracted participatory
statements using a layered framework adapted from prior work on social media.
We examined the emotional dimensions of these statements, detecting eight key
emotions and their association with varying stages of activism. We found that
emotional profiles vary by stage, with different positive emotions standing out
during calls-to-action, intention, and execution. We detected negative
associations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to
theoretical expectations. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how
activism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and how emotional framing may
depend on the format of the discussion.

*Kanlun Wang,Zhe Fu,Wangjiaxuan Xin,Lina Zhou,Shashi Kiran Chandrappa*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study introduces a computational framework analyzing domestic violence self-disclosures and support mechanisms on social media, enabling insights and interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domestic violence victims often disclose their experiences on social media, highlighting gaps in understanding support-seeking behavior and community responses.

Method: The researchers developed a framework comprising detection of self-disclosure posts, clustering them, summarizing topics, and extracting/mapping support mechanisms.

Result: The framework was implemented on social media data, yielding insights into self-disclosures and support patterns, advancing knowledge in these areas.

Conclusion: The findings enable the development of victim-centered digital interventions and expand understanding of online support-seeking in domestic violence contexts.

Abstract: Domestic Violence (DV) is a pervasive public health problem characterized by
patterns of coercive and abusive behavior within intimate relationships. With
the rise of social media as a key outlet for DV victims to disclose their
experiences, online self-disclosure has emerged as a critical yet underexplored
avenue for support-seeking. In addition, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and nuanced understanding of DV self-disclosure, support
provisions, and their connections. To address these gaps, this study proposes a
novel computational framework for modeling DV support-seeking behavior
alongside community support mechanisms. The framework consists of four key
components: self-disclosure detection, post clustering, topic summarization,
and support extraction and mapping. We implement and evaluate the framework
with data collected from relevant social media communities. Our findings not
only advance existing knowledge on DV self-disclosure and online support
provisions but also enable victim-centered digital interventions.

*Gabriel Chuang,Augustin Chaintreau*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper studies the limitations and implications of a network embedding algorithm concerning the representation of generative graph models and its applications in link prediction and community detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the effectiveness and limitations of network embedding algorithms in preserving graph generative models and their impact on structural biases in link prediction and community detection.

Method: The authors explicitly characterize when embeddings capture graph generative models, analyze equivalence classes of graphons, and assess the effects of embeddings on downstream tasks like link prediction.

Result: Findings reveal that embeddings preserve community structure but lose density information. Link prediction using embeddings alone is prone to structural biases, sometimes mitigating or exacerbating them.

Conclusion: Network embeddings have limitations in fully representing generative graph models, which affects tasks like link prediction. Awareness of these biases can guide better methods or algorithms in similar applications.

Abstract: We analyze a simple algorithm for network embedding, explicitly
characterizing conditions under which the learned representation encodes the
graph's generative model fully, partially, or not at all. In cases where the
embedding loses some information (i.e., is not invertible), we describe the
equivalence classes of graphons that map to the same embedding, finding that
these classes preserve community structure but lose substantial density
information. Finally, we show implications for community detection and link
prediction. Our results suggest strong limitations on the effectiveness of link
prediction based on embeddings alone, and we show common conditions under which
naive link prediction adds edges in a disproportionate manner that can either
mitigate or exacerbate structural biases.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Pressure Threshold model (PT) to simulate influence spread in social networks, modifies the Linear Threshold model, and studies seed node selection for Influence Maximization (IM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing diffusion models like the Linear Threshold model, specifically by incorporating dynamic influence adjustments based on incoming pressure.

Method: Developed the PT model where a node's outgoing influence adjusts dynamically based on its activated neighbors' influence. Used experiments on real-world networks with enhanced open-source tools.

Result: The PT model demonstrated unique and distinct seed node selection compared to the LT model. It also showed increased influence propagation in densely connected networks.

Conclusion: The PT model effectively simulates social influence spread and impacts Influence Maximization strategies, especially in dense networks.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, an individual's local social network carries
significant influence over the opinions they form and subsequently propagate to
others. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model -- the Pressure
Threshold model (PT) -- for dynamically simulating the spread of influence
through a social network. This new model extends the popular Linear Threshold
Model (LT) by adjusting a node's outgoing influence proportional to the
influence it receives from its activated neighbors. We address the Influence
Maximization (IM) problem, which involves selecting the most effective seed
nodes to achieve maximal graph coverage after a diffusion process, and how the
problem manifests with the PT Model. Experiments conducted on real-world
networks, facilitated by enhancements to the open-source network-diffusion
Python library, CyNetDiff, demonstrate unique seed node selection for the PT
Model when compared to the LT Model. Moreover, analyses demonstrate that
densely connected networks amplify pressure effects more significantly than
sparse networks.

thought dropout mechanism that focuses reasoning on challenging cases.
Integrated with GRPO training, these strategies enable the model to learn more
effectively from informative samples. Experiments on MMAU-mini and MMAR
demonstrate that Omni-CLST achieves competitive accuracy (73.80% on MMAU-mini)
and establishes a new state of the art (64.30% on MMAR), highlighting its
robustness and generalization capability in multimodal audio-language
understanding.

*Christian Zhou-Zheng,John Backsund,Dun Li Chan,Alex Coventry,Avid Eslami,Jyotin Goel,Xingwen Han,Danysh Soomro,Galen Wei*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a simple next-token-prediction model for symbolic piano music continuation, emphasizing efficiency over complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the trend of relying on large, complex models for tasks and suggests simpler methods may still be more effective for constrained problems like symbolic piano music continuation.

Method: A straightforward next-token-prediction objective is applied to tokenized raw MIDI data, focusing on improving data quality and fundamentals rather than architectural complexity.

Result: The approach attempts to outperform large foundation models with its simplicity and the emphasis on better data and fundamentals.

Conclusion: Simple methods can be more effective than large foundational models in specific constrained tasks like symbolic piano music generation.

Abstract: We present a traditional approach to symbolic piano music continuation for
the MIREX 2025 Symbolic Music Generation challenge. While computational music
generation has recently focused on developing large foundation models with
sophisticated architectural modifications, we argue that simpler approaches
remain more effective for constrained, single-instrument tasks. We thus return
to a simple, unaugmented next-token-prediction objective on tokenized raw MIDI,
aiming to outperform large foundation models by using better data and better
fundamentals. We release model weights and code at

### [453] [More Similar than Dissimilar: Modeling Annotators for Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12295)
*James Tavernor,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to efficiently personalize speech emotion recognition by leveraging inter-annotator similarity, requiring minimal data from new annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech emotion recognition models struggle to predict individual annotator preferences and need extensive data to adapt to new annotators.

Method: The proposed system identifies a similar annotator from a pre-trained model on a large population, enabling predictions for a new annotator using limited data.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms other off-the-shelf methods in personalization and lightweight adaptation.

Conclusion: The system offers a practical, low-cost solution for adapting emotion recognition in real-world scenarios by leveraging annotator similarity.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition systems often predict a consensus value generated
from the ratings of multiple annotators. However, these models have limited
ability to predict the annotation of any one person. Alternatively, models can
learn to predict the annotations of all annotators. Adapting such models to new
annotators is difficult as new annotators must individually provide sufficient
labeled training data. We propose to leverage inter-annotator similarity by
using a model pre-trained on a large annotator population to identify a
similar, previously seen annotator. Given a new, previously unseen, annotator
and limited enrollment data, we can make predictions for a similar annotator,
enabling off-the-shelf annotation of unseen data in target datasets, providing
a mechanism for extremely low-cost personalization. We demonstrate our approach
significantly outperforms other off-the-shelf approaches, paving the way for
lightweight emotion adaptation, practical for real-world deployment.

### [454] [A Lightweight Pipeline for Noisy Speech Voice Cloning and Accurate Lip Sync Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12831)
*Javeria Amir,Farwa Attaria,Mah Jabeen,Umara Noor,Zahid Rashid*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper presents a modular pipeline combining Tortoise text-to-speech and GAN-based lip synchronization for zero-shot voice cloning and real-time lip-sync in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for voice cloning and lip synchronization rely on extensive datasets, clean input conditions, and significant computational resources, making them impractical for noisy or low-resource environments.

Method: The authors propose a modular pipeline using Tortoise text-to-speech (a transformer-based latent diffusion model for zero-shot voice cloning) alongside a lightweight GAN for real-time lip synchronization.

Result: The pipeline achieves high-quality voice cloning and robust lip synchronization under noisy and unconstrained conditions, requiring minimal training samples.

Conclusion: This modular approach reduces dependence on massive pre-training and enables emotionally expressive speech synthesis and lip sync in challenging scenarios, with scalability for future multimodal applications.

Abstract: Recent developments in voice cloning and talking head generation demonstrate
impressive capabilities in synthesizing natural speech and realistic lip
synchronization. Current methods typically require and are trained on large
scale datasets and computationally intensive processes using clean studio
recorded inputs that is infeasible in noisy or low resource environments. In
this paper, we introduce a new modular pipeline comprising Tortoise text to
speech. It is a transformer based latent diffusion model that can perform high
fidelity zero shot voice cloning given only a few training samples. We use a
lightweight generative adversarial network architecture for robust real time
lip synchronization. The solution will contribute to many essential tasks
concerning less reliance on massive pre training generation of emotionally
expressive speech and lip synchronization in noisy and unconstrained scenarios.
The modular structure of the pipeline allows an easy extension for future multi
modal and text guided voice modulation and it could be used in real world
systems.

*Xin Fang,Guirui Zhong,Qing Wang,Fan Chu,Lei Wang,Mengui Qian,Mingqi Cai,Jiangzhao Wu,Jianqing Gao,Jun Du*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach to assign pseudo-attribute labels for anomalous sound detection (ASD), leveraging representations from a domain-adaptive pre-trained model, followed by fine-tuning for enhanced classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited availability of labeled machine attribute data for ASD makes exhaustive label collection impractical, motivating the need for a method that can assign pseudo-attribute labels using readily accessible representations.

Method: The authors employ a domain-adaptive pre-trained model to extract representations and assign pseudo-attribute labels through agglomerative hierarchical clustering. They then adapt the model further with supervised fine-tuning for machine attribute classification.

Result: The proposed approach achieves substantial performance improvements in ASD, surpassing the authors' previously top-ranking model on the DCASE 2025 Challenge dataset.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the issue of missing attribute labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its efficacy in ASD tasks.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) is often formulated as a machine attribute
classification task, a strategy necessitated by the common scenario where only
normal data is available for training. However, the exhaustive collection of
machine attribute labels is laborious and impractical. To address the challenge
of missing attribute labels, this paper proposes an agglomerative hierarchical
clustering method for the assignment of pseudo-attribute labels using
representations derived from a domain-adaptive pre-trained model, which are
expected to capture machine attribute characteristics. We then apply model
adaptation to this pre-trained model through supervised fine-tuning for machine
attribute classification, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance.
Evaluation on the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events
(DCASE) 2025 Challenge dataset demonstrates that our proposed approach yields
significant performance gains, ultimately outperforming our previous
top-ranking system in the challenge.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a contrastive learning framework for musical instrument retrieval using both single and multi-instrument sounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of efficiently retrieving specific instrument timbres from audio mixtures in digital music production.

Method: Contrastive learning framework with novel data augmentation techniques to generate positive/negative sound pairs for virtual musical instruments.

Result: Contrastive approaches achieve competitive performance for single-instrument retrieval and outperform existing methods for multi-instrument retrieval, with high top-1 and top-5 accuracies.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations in audio data augmentation, enhancing instrument retrieval tasks in both single and multi-instrument contexts.

Abstract: Efficiently retrieving specific instrument timbres from audio mixtures
remains a challenge in digital music production. This paper introduces a
contrastive learning framework for musical instrument retrieval, enabling
direct querying of instrument databases using a single model for both single-
and multi-instrument sounds. We propose techniques to generate realistic
positive/negative pairs of sounds for virtual musical instruments, such as
samplers and synthesizers, addressing limitations in common audio data
augmentation methods.
  The first experiment focuses on instrument retrieval from a dataset of 3,884
instruments, using single-instrument audio as input. Contrastive approaches are
competitive with previous works based on classification pre-training. The
second experiment considers multi-instrument retrieval with a mixture of
instruments as audio input. In this case, the proposed contrastive framework
outperforms related works, achieving 81.7\% top-1 and 95.7\% top-5 accuracies
for three-instrument mixtures.

*Po-Heng Chou,Jiun-Jia Wu,Wan-Jen Huang,Ronald Y. Chang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a sustainable LSTM-based precoding framework for RIS-assisted mmWave MIMO that implicitly learns channel characteristics for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in mmWave MIMO systems such as high pilot overhead, inference complexity, and energy consumption while accommodating practical hardware constraints.

Method: The framework uses LSTM models that exploit uplink pilot sequences, incorporating RIS phase-dependent amplitude modeling and multi-label training for robustness.

Result: The design achieves over 90% spectral efficiency of exhaustive search with only 2.2% computation time, reducing energy consumption significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is energy-efficient, scalable, and robust, making it highly practical for next-generation sustainable 6G networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state
information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to
implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and
inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by
incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a
multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal
codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed
design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES)
with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly
two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under
distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a
practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.

### [458] [Context-Aware Language Models for Forecasting Market Impact from Sequences of Financial News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12519)
*Ross Koval,Nicholas Andrews,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper shows the benefit of incorporating historical context into financial news analysis, enhancing prediction accuracy and improving investment simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial news significantly impacts stock prices, but news articles often require a deeper historical context for accurate interpretation.

Method: A method combining a large language model (LM) for analyzing main articles and a smaller LM for summarizing historical context into aligned embeddings was proposed.

Result: Historical context consistently improves model performance across methods and timeframes, yielding better interpretability and investment simulation results.

Conclusion: Using historical context in financial news analysis enhances prediction accuracy and has practical applications in investment strategies.

Abstract: Financial news plays a critical role in the information diffusion process in
financial markets and is a known driver of stock prices. However, the
information in each news article is not necessarily self-contained, often
requiring a broader understanding of the historical news coverage for accurate
interpretation. Further, identifying and incorporating the most relevant
contextual information presents significant challenges. In this work, we
explore the value of historical context in the ability of large language models
to understand the market impact of financial news. We find that historical
context provides a consistent and significant improvement in performance across
methods and time horizons. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective
contextualization method that uses a large LM to process the main article,
while a small LM encodes the historical context into concise summary embeddings
that are then aligned with the large model's representation space. We explore
the behavior of the model through multiple qualitative and quantitative
interpretability tests and reveal insights into the value of contextualization.
Finally, we demonstrate that the value of historical context in model
predictions has real-world applications, translating to substantial
improvements in simulated investment performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the algebraic and geometric properties of multiview ideals formed in pinhole camera image formation and extend those to unknown cameras.

Method: The authors use a criterion by Huang and Larson to prove a universal Gr√∂bner basis for multiview ideals, deploying symmetry reduction and induction for generalization.

Result: The method successfully proves the universal Gr√∂bner basis for multiview ideals, gives a proof of the Huang-Larson criterion, and describes associated matroids.

Conclusion: The paper advances the understanding of multiview ideals and their universal counterparts, offering tools for handling their algebraic structure and extending insights using generalizable methods.

Abstract: Multiview ideals arise from the geometry of image formation in pinhole
cameras, and universal multiview ideals are their analogs for unknown cameras.
We prove that a natural collection of polynomials form a universal Gr\"obner
basis for both types of ideals using a criterion introduced by Huang and
Larson, and include a proof of their criterion in our setting. Symmetry
reduction and induction enable the method to be deployed on an infinite family
of ideals. We also give an explicit description of the matroids on which the
methodology depends, in the context of multiview ideals.

TL;DR: The paper examines costrong functors, which are dual to strong functors, in relation to their interaction with monoidal structures and their implications for computation semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While strong functors and comonads have been widely studied for their roles in computation, the concept of 'costrong' functors as their dual counterpart remains unexplored. This paper aims to fill that gap to gain a better understanding of computation semantics.

Method: The paper adopts a theoretical approach to define and explore costrong functors and their behavior in relation to monoidal structures. It emphasizes the dualization of existing frameworks for strong functors.

Result: As a work in progress, this paper focuses on establishing foundational insights into costrong functors, highlighting their natural properties and potential impact on computation semantics.

Conclusion: The exploration of costrong functors promises to uncover a novel perspective on how functors interact with monoidal structures, providing valuable insights for the semantics of computation.

Abstract: Strong functors and monads are ubiquitous in Computer Science. More recently,
comonads have demonstrated their use in structuring context-dependent notions
of computation. However, the dualisation of ``being strong'' property passed
somehow unobserved so far. We argue that ``being costrong'' gives a different
understanding of how functors can interact with monoidal structures. This work
in progress aims to explore costrong functors and their natural properties,
with an eye towards the semantics of computations.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper proves the ratio-consistency of the jackknife variance estimator in generalized settings and applies it to a regression estimator under less restrictive conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a unified framework proving the consistency of the jackknife variance estimator for generalized U-statistics, addressing gaps in the current literature.

Method: The authors leverage the H\'ajek projection dominance condition to analyze and prove ratio-consistency for the jackknife method. They then apply this theoretical result to a practical case: the nearest-neighbor regression estimator.

Result: The jackknife variance estimator is shown to be ratio-consistent under generalized conditions, extending existing results and relaxing previous assumptions.

Conclusion: The study broadens the applicability and reliability of the jackknife method in statistical variance estimation, unifying diverse criteria under the H\'ajek projection condition and demonstrating practical utility in regression analysis.

Abstract: We prove ratio-consistency of the jackknife variance estimator, and certain
variants, for a broad class of generalized U-statistics whose variance is
asymptotically dominated by their H\'ajek projection, with the classical
fixed-order case recovered as a special instance. This H\'ajek projection
dominance condition unifies and generalizes several criteria in the existing
literature, placing the simple nonparametric jackknife on the same footing as
the infinitesimal jackknife in the generalized setting. As an illustration, we
apply our result to the two-scale distributional nearest-neighbor regression
estimator, obtaining consistent variance estimates under substantially weaker
conditions than previously required.

*Romane Giard,Yohann de Castro,Cl√©ment Marteau*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper focuses on estimating Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with unknown diagonal covariances using the Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO) method, providing theoretical guarantees and a novel approach to component separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Mixture Models are widely used but challenging to estimate accurately when parameters like the number of components and diagonal covariances are unknown. This paper aims to address this problem with a more flexible and reliable framework.

Method: The paper extends the Beurling-LASSO convex optimization framework to handle multivariate GMMs where component-specific diagonal covariances are unknown. It combines sparsity-promoting techniques and novel geometric insights to derive recovery guarantees.

Result: The authors achieved recovery guarantees with nearly parametric convergence rates for estimating means, covariances, weights, and density prediction. The work introduced a separation condition that ensures robust statistical performance.

Conclusion: This study generalized BLASSO for more complex GMMs and offered theoretical tools, including a new semi-distance and Fisher-Rao geometry insights. It advances both the methodology and understanding of statistical recovery in mixture models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the statistical estimation of Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) with unknown diagonal covariances from independent and identically
distributed samples. We employ the Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO), a convex
optimization framework that promotes sparsity in the space of measures, to
simultaneously estimate the number of components and their parameters. Our main
contribution extends the BLASSO methodology to multivariate GMMs with
component-specific unknown diagonal covariance matrices-a significantly more
flexible setting than previous approaches requiring known and identical
covariances. We establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees with nearly
parametric convergence rates for component means, diagonal covariances, and
weights, as well as for density prediction. A key theoretical contribution is
the identification of an explicit separation condition on mixture components
that enables the construction of non-degenerate dual certificates-essential
tools for establishing statistical guarantees for the BLASSO. Our analysis
leverages the Fisher-Rao geometry of the statistical model and introduces a
novel semi-distance adapted to our framework, providing new insights into the
interplay between component separation, parameter space geometry, and
achievable statistical recovery.

### [463] [Optimal Conformal Prediction, E-values, Fuzzy Prediction Sets and Subsequent Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13130)
*Nick W. Koning,Sam van Meer*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces fuzzy conformal confidence sets which provide finer granularity for prediction and connects them to e-values. It showcases their application, optimality, and generalization beyond traditional conformal settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the granularity and flexibility of conformal prediction by introducing fuzzy confidence sets and connecting them to e-values.

Method: Proposes fuzzy conformal confidence sets, derives their optimality through a minimization problem viewed as an optimal testing scenario, and generalizes guarantees from classical to fuzzy predictions.

Result: Demonstrates that fuzzy confidence sets are essentially predictive distributions with superior error guarantees. Shows optimality of traditional sets and generalizes results to arbitrary models.

Conclusion: Fuzzy confidence sets enhance prediction flexibility and inherit guarantees while expanding conformal prediction methods to arbitrary models through a connection with valid hypothesis tests.

Abstract: We make three contributions to conformal prediction. First, we propose fuzzy
conformal confidence sets that offer a degree of exclusion, generalizing beyond
the binary inclusion/exclusion offered by classical confidence sets. We connect
fuzzy confidence sets to e-values to show this degree of exclusion is
equivalent to an exclusion at different confidence levels, capturing precisely
what e-values bring to conformal prediction. We show that a fuzzy confidence
set is a predictive distribution with a more appropriate error guarantee.
Second, we derive optimal conformal confidence sets by interpreting the
minimization of the expected measure of the confidence set as an optimal
testing problem against a particular alternative. We use this to characterize
exactly in what sense traditional conformal prediction is optimal. Third, we
generalize the inheritance of guarantees by subsequent minimax decisions from
confidence sets to fuzzy confidence sets. All our results generalize beyond the
exchangeable conformal setting to prediction sets for arbitrary models. In
particular, we find that any valid test (e-value) for a hypothesis
automatically defines a (fuzzy) prediction confidence set.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for phase retrieval in inline holography using a diffusion model trained on amplitude data, enabling complex field reconstruction without needing ground-truth phase data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase retrieval is an ill-posed problem due to the nonlinear relation between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging, necessitating efficient solutions.

Method: The proposed method uses a diffusion model trained on object amplitude and a predictor-corrector sampling framework with likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, enabling phase retrieval without ground-truth phase data.

Result: The method demonstrates robust generalization across various objects, imaging systems, and modalities, including accurate reconstruction of complex biological tissues using data from simple objects like polystyrene beads.

Conclusion: The framework offers a general, cost-effective solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging and sets the stage for applications beyond holography.

Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse
problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent
imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion
model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase
from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework
with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables
complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for
training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and
experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes,
imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups.
Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene
beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures,
highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a
cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in
computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent
imaging applications beyond holography.
