### [1] [Japanese AI Agent System on Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: System Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10718)
*Junyu Liu,Siwen Yang,Dexiu Ma,Qian Niu,Zequn Zhang,Momoko Nagai-Tanima,Tomoki Aoyama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study developed an AI-based system to address HPV vaccine hesitancy, delivering verified information and analyzing public discourse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of HPV vaccine hesitancy in Japan, compounded by misinformation and the suspension of proactive recommendations from 2013 to 2021.

Method: A multi-tool AI system using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot integrated with diverse data sources and analytical modules was designed to facilitate information dissemination and public discourse analysis.

Result: The chatbot performed exceptionally with high scores for relevance, correctness, and retention in single and multi-turn evaluations. The report generation system achieved high completeness and correctness.

Conclusion: The proposed AI system shows promise in addressing vaccine hesitancy by simultaneously communicating verified information and analyzing public discourse, with potential adaptability to other medical fields.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy poses significant public health challenges, particularly in Japan where proactive vaccination recommendations were suspended from 2013 to 2021. The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication. The architecture enables verified information delivery with source attribution while providing systematic public discourse analysis, with a transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts.

### [2] [Do You Trust Me? Cognitive-Affective Signatures of Trustworthiness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10719)
*Gerard Yeo,Svetlana Churina,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) encode perceived trustworthiness and finds that trust cues are psychologically coherent and encoded implicitly during pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs represent psychologically grounded trustworthiness cues relevant to navigating online information.

Method: Analysis conducted on instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral) using the PEACE-Reviews dataset to evaluate trustworthiness indicators like cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions.

Result: Finds systematic differences in activation patterns for high- vs. low-trust texts, with trust cues being linearly de-codable and strengthened through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs inherently represent trust signals central to human cognition, providing groundwork for designing credible and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Perceived trustworthiness underpins how users navigate online information, yet it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs),increasingly embedded in search, recommendation, and conversational systems, represent this construct in psychologically coherent ways. We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online. These findings demonstrate that modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, offering a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trust-worthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

### [3] [Building AI Agents to Improve Job Referral Requests to Strangers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10726)
*Ross Chu,Yuting Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents AI systems for improving job referral requests, including improver and evaluator agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase the effectiveness of online referral requests through AI-driven improvements.

Method: The paper uses LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to rewrite job referral requests and measure their predicted success.

Result: Revised requests from RAG-LLMs improve success rates for weaker requests by 14% without reducing stronger requests' performance.

Conclusion: RAG-LLM revisions provide efficient ways to optimize referral request performance, though real-world effectiveness is untested.

Abstract: This paper develops AI agents that help job seekers write effective requests for job referrals in a professional online community. The basic workflow consists of an improver agent that rewrites the referral request and an evaluator agent that measures the quality of revisions using a model trained to predict the probability of receiving referrals from other users. Revisions suggested by the LLM (large language model) increase predicted success rates for weaker requests while reducing them for stronger requests. Enhancing the LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevents edits that worsen stronger requests while it amplifies improvements for weaker requests. Overall, using LLM revisions with RAG increases the predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14\% without degrading performance on stronger requests. Although improvements in model-predicted success do not guarantee more referrals in the real world, they provide low-cost signals for promising features before running higher-stakes experiments on real users.

### [4] [ORBITFLOW: SLO-Aware Long-Context LLM Serving with Fine-Grained KV Cache Reconfiguration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10729)
*Xinyue Ma,Heelim Hong,Taegeon Um,Jongseop Lee,Seoyeong Choy,Woo-Yeon Lee,Myeongjae Jeon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORBITFLOW, an adaptive system for efficient KV cache management in long-context LLM serving, improving latency, throughput, and SLO attainment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context LLM serving faces challenges in handling fluctuating memory demands, leading to latency issues and SLO violations due to static offloading strategies.

Method: ORBITFLOW uses an ILP solver for fine-grained GPU KV cache management and runtime feedback to dynamically optimize cache placements. A fallback mechanism is used under heavy loads.

Result: ORBITFLOW shows improvements in SLO attainment (66% for TPOT, 48% for TBT), reduces 95th percentile latency by 38%, and achieves up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to static methods.

Conclusion: ORBITFLOW effectively tackles the memory fluctuation and latency issues in long-context LLM serving, making it a more resilient and efficient solution than static strategies.

Abstract: Serving long-context LLMs is challenging because request lengths and batch composition vary during token generation, causing the memory footprint to fluctuate significantly at runtime. Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods.

### [5] [CTHA: Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture for Stable Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10738)
*Percy Jardine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA) designed to improve stability and scalability in multi-time-scale hierarchical agent systems while reducing inter-layer conflicts and error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges posed by temporal hierarchies with distinct cognitive layers, particularly inter-layer conflicts, error propagation, and scalability issues in multi-agent systems.

Method: CTHA applies three constraints: Message Contract Constraints for structured communication, Authority Manifold Constraints to limit decisions by temporal scope, and Arbiter Resolution Constraints for conflict-free decision-making.

Result: Empirical results showed CTHA achieving a 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x better sample efficiency, and scalability improvements over traditional baselines.

Conclusion: CTHA enhances the coordination efficiency of hierarchical systems, providing robust frameworks for scalable and coherent decision-making in complex tasks, and holds promise for advancing autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recently, multi-time-scale agent architectures have extended the ubiquitous single-loop paradigm by introducing temporal hierarchies with distinct cognitive layers. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.

### [6] [Explore with Long-term Memory: A Benchmark and Multimodal LLM-based Reinforcement Learning Framework for Embodied Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10744)
*Sen Wang,Bangwei Liu,Zhenkun Gao,Lizhuang Ma,Xuhong Wang,Yuan Xie,Xin Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMEE and LMEE-Bench to enhance agents' lifelong learning by focusing on exploration and memory use, proposing MemoryExplorer to improve proactive memory capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance embodied agents' ability for lifelong learning with a focus on exploration and memory use beyond one-shot task completion.

Method: Proposed LMEE framework and LMEE-Bench dataset; introduced MemoryExplorer that fine-tunes multimodal large language models using reinforcement learning.

Result: MemoryExplorer outperforms state-of-the-art embodied exploration models in long-horizon tasks through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework and model improve agents' exploration, memory utilization, and decision-making for achieving practical lifelong learning.

Abstract: An ideal embodied agent should possess lifelong learning capabilities to handle long-horizon and complex tasks, enabling continuous operation in general environments. This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.

### [7] [Optimisation of complex product innovation processes based on trend models with three-valued logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10768)
*Nina Bočková,Barbora Volná,Mirko Dohnal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces heuristic-based models to understand complex product-innovation processes and uses transition graphs to depict system behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of analyzing product-innovation processes without resorting to numerical values or rough sets, making it information-efficient.

Method: Models grounded in heuristics represented by simple trends are constructed, and scenario transitions are depicted through a transition graph to visualize possible system behaviors.

Result: Scenarios and their transitions are modeled via a transition graph, enabling depiction of future or past system behavior by analyzing the graph paths.

Conclusion: Minimally information-intensive heuristics and trend models provide an efficient way to analyze and depict complex product-innovation processes.

Abstract: This paper investigates complex product-innovation processes using models grounded in a set of heuristics. Each heuristic is expressed through simple trends -- increasing, decreasing, or constant -- which serve as minimally information-intensive quantifiers, avoiding reliance on numerical values or rough sets. A solution to a trend model is defined as a set of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by a transition graph. Any possible future or past behaviour of the system under study can thus be depicted by a path within this graph.

### [8] [ARC Prize 2025: Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10904)
*François Chollet,Mike Knoop,Gregory Kamradt,Bryan Landers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The ARC-AGI benchmark evaluates few-shot generalization in AI with increasing task complexity, highlighting iterative refinement loops and revealing current AI reasoning limits tied to knowledge coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and drive progress in AI reasoning and fluid intelligence using challenging benchmarks like ARC-AGI.

Method: Analyzing and evaluating entries from a Kaggle competition targeting refined reasoning techniques, exploring evolutionary synthesis and zero-pretraining methods, and surveying ARC-AGI benchmarking trends.

Result: Top score on ARC-AGI-2 reached 24% in private evaluations; iterative refinement methods gained focus while new benchmarks addressed reasoning challenges.

Conclusion: Despite advances, AI performance is limited by knowledge-driven overfitting, with upcoming ARC-AGI-3 focusing on deeper interactive reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The ARC-AGI benchmark series serves as a critical measure of few-shot generalization on novel tasks, a core aspect of intelligence. The ARC Prize 2025 global competition targeted the newly released ARC-AGI-2 dataset, which features greater task complexity compared to its predecessor. The Kaggle competition attracted 1,455 teams and 15,154 entries, with the top score reaching 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set. Paper submissions nearly doubled year-over-year to 90 entries, reflecting the growing research interest in fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. The defining theme of 2025 is the emergence of the refinement loop -- a per-task iterative program optimization loop guided by a feedback signal. Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination. In this paper, we survey the top-performing methods, examine the role of refinement loops in AGI progress, discuss knowledge-dependent overfitting, and preview ARC-AGI-3, which introduces interactive reasoning challenges that require exploration, planning, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment capabilities.

### [9] [What Matters in Data Curation for Multimodal Reasoning? Insights from the DCVLR Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10922)
*Yosub Shin,Michael Buriek,Boris Sobolev,Pavel Bushuyeu,Vikas Kumar,Haoyang Xu,Samuel Watson,Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines data curation for multimodal reasoning using the NeurIPS 2025 DCVLR challenge. Difficulty-based example selection on aligned datasets is key for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand data curation's impact on vision-language reasoning by isolating model and training factors using the DCVLR challenge.

Method: Leverage difficulty-based example selection with a curated dataset from Walton Multimodal Cold Start. Ablation studies were conducted post-competition.

Result: Difficulty-based selection proved most effective for performance. Enlarging dataset size only reduced variance, while diversity and augmentation had little benefit or negative effects.

Conclusion: Success in multimodal reasoning depends strongly on data alignment and difficulty selection, not dataset size or diversity heuristics.

Abstract: We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for Vision-Language Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge, which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as a saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning.

### [10] [AdaMARP: An Adaptive Multi-Agent Interaction Framework for General Immersive Role-Playing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11007)
*Zhenhua Xu,Dongsheng Chen,Shuo Wang,Jian Li,Chengjie Wang,Meng Han,Yabiao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdaMARP is an adaptive role-playing framework enhancing multi-character interaction, scene dynamics, and narrative coherence in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM role-playing systems suffer from limited immersion due to static scenes and poor handling of dynamic environmental information.

Method: AdaMARP introduces an immersive message format interleaving thoughts, actions, environment, and speech. It employs a Scene Manager and training datasets (AdaRPSet and AdaSMSet) to improve adaptability and coherence.

Result: AdaRPSet improves character consistency and environment dynamics. An 8B model outperforms some commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet handles smoother scene transitions, with a 14B model surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5.

Conclusion: AdaMARP significantly enhances role-playing capabilities in LLMs, offering better narrative coherence and adaptability across multiple scenarios.

Abstract: LLM role-playing aims to portray arbitrary characters in interactive narratives, yet existing systems often suffer from limited immersion and adaptability. They typically under-model dynamic environmental information and assume largely static scenes and casts, offering insufficient support for multi-character orchestration, scene transitions, and on-the-fly character introduction. We propose an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework, AdaMARP, featuring an immersive message format that interleaves [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, and Speech, together with an explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) accompanied by rationales. To train these capabilities, we construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for supervising orchestration decisions, and introduce AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation. Experiments across multiple backbones and model scales demonstrate consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor outperforming several commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions, surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5 using only a 14B LLM.

### [11] [Efficient Protein Optimization via Structure-aware Hamiltonian Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11012)
*Jiahao Wang,Shuangjia Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HADES, a novel Bayesian optimization method for engineering optimized protein variants by leveraging structural constraints and Hamiltonian dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in sequence-based protein optimization caused by epistasis effects and ignored structural constraints, aiming to enhance biotechnology and medicine.

Method: HADES utilizes Hamiltonian dynamics and Bayesian optimization with a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to learn structure-function relationships and propose optimized protein sequences.

Result: HADES outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in computational evaluations, showcasing its ability to design protein sequences aligned with structural constraints and optimized properties.

Conclusion: HADES is effective in addressing high-dimensional complexities in protein optimization, offering improved design capabilities while bridging sequence-structure-function relationships.

Abstract: The ability to engineer optimized protein variants has transformative potential for biotechnology and medicine. Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/GENTEL-lab/HADES.

### [12] [BAPO: Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization for Reliable Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11037)
*Shiyu Liu,Yongjing Yin,Jianhao Yan,Yunbo Tang,Qinggang Zhang,Bei Li,Xin Chen,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO) to make reinforcement learning-based agents more reliable by improving their ability to admit 'I don't know' (IDK) when reasoning limits are reached.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based agents, while enabling complex problem-solving with external search, suffer from reliability issues as they fail to recognize reasoning boundaries and rarely admit IDK, leading to plausible yet inaccurate answers. This presents real-world risks.

Method: The authors propose BAPO, which includes a group-based boundary-aware reward to encourage IDK responses when reasoning is limited, and an adaptive reward modulator to avoid IDK exploitation during exploration.

Result: Experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO significantly improves the reliability of RL-powered agentic searches.

Conclusion: BAPO enhances the ability of RL-based agents to admit IDK responses, improving reliability without compromising the accuracy of results.

Abstract: RL-based agentic search enables LLMs to solve complex questions via dynamic planning and external search. While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgencyBench, a benchmark to evaluate AI agents across long-horizon, real-world scenarios using automated rollout and assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate multifaceted agentic capabilities and rely heavily on human feedback, limiting scalability.

Method: AgencyBench evaluates AI agents across 32 scenarios featuring 138 tasks, utilizing user simulation for feedback and Docker sandboxes for rubric-based automated evaluation.

Result: Experiments show closed-source models outperform open-source ones in agency-related tasks, with proprietary models excelling within native ecosystems.

Conclusion: AgencyBench establishes a foundational testbed for next-gen autonomous agents, emphasizing co-optimization of model architectures and agentic frameworks, while releasing tools publicly for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.

### [14] [MiCA: A Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter for Lightweight Epidemic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11089)
*Suhan Guo,Jiahong Deng,Furao Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MiCA, a lightweight module for epidemic forecasting that uses causal discovery to incorporate mobility relations, achieving a 7.5% error reduction and improving robustness in noisy, data-limited conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of using noisy, indirect mobility data and coarse epidemic case time series for accurate forecasting limits the effectiveness of current forecasters.

Method: MiCA employs causal discovery for mobility relations and integrates them into temporal forecasting models using gated residual mixing, avoiding complex heavy models.

Result: MiCA improves lightweight temporal backbones with an average relative error reduction of 7.5% and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal models.

Conclusion: MiCA effectively enhances epidemic forecasting by exploiting mobility-derived spatial structure without heavy computational models, making it robust and efficient in noisy and data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.

TL;DR: ReCreate presents a framework to automate domain-specific agent creation using experience-driven insights for improved performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and computational expense of current methods for creating domain agents, which often involve manual design or black-box automation approaches lacking insights into agent performance.

Method: Proposes an experience-driven framework using agent-as-optimizer logic, relying on interaction histories with three components: experience storage/retrieval, a reasoning-creation synergy pipeline, and hierarchical updates.

Result: ReCreate outperforms both human-designed agents and existing automated methods across diverse domains, even with minimal initial input.

Conclusion: Leveraging interaction histories is critical for automating and improving agent design, showcasing a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents are reshaping the industrial landscape. However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

*Zixu Wang,Bingbing Xu,Yige Yuan,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALE, a cost-efficient task-level generation framework for Multi-Agent Systems, which maintains performance while significantly reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in workflow generation and evaluation in Multi-Agent Systems based on large language models by improving cost-effectiveness and reliability.

Method: The proposed framework, SCALE, avoids exhaustive execution by using self-prediction and few-shot calibration for evaluation, eliminating the need for full validation execution.

Result: SCALE achieves competitive results with only a 0.61% performance degradation while reducing token usage by up to 83%, compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SCALE is an innovative, low-cost method for task-level workflow generation and evaluation, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on large language models typically solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents through workflows. Existing approaches generates workflows either at task level or query level, but their relative costs and benefits remain unclear. After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \textbf{SCALE}, which means \underline{\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \underline{\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \underline{\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\%.

### [17] [TANDEM: Temporal-Aware Neural Detection for Multimodal Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11178)
*Girish A. Koushik,Helen Treharne,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TANDEM, a framework for interpretable multimodal hate detection, improving accuracy and precision in identifying offensive content and grounding evidence temporally in complex settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge posed by "black box" automated systems that lack granular and interpretable evidence for multimodal hate detection, such as timestamps and identities, necessary for effective human moderation.

Method: The method introduces TANDEM, a framework utilizing a tandem reinforcement learning approach where vision-language and audio-language models mutually improve reasoning across extended sequences in multimodal contexts, requiring minimal supervision.

Result: TANDEM outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving a high F1 score of 0.73 on HateMM, with a 30% improvement over previous state-of-the-art systems while preserving precise temporal grounding.

Conclusion: Structured and interpretable detection is achievable in multimodal content, offering a way forward for more transparent and actionable moderation tools in online safety.

Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.

*Sofiene Lassoued,Asrat Gobachew,Stefan Lier,Andreas Schwung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning framework for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) using a policy-based hyper-heuristic strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an adaptive and efficient method for solving the complex Job Shop Scheduling Problem by overcoming limitations of traditional heuristics and metaheuristics.

Method: The approach involves introducing a hyper-heuristic framework with action prefiltering to ensure feasible actions and a commitment mechanism to control heuristic switching. Two action selection strategies—deterministic and stochastic—were analyzed.

Result: Computational experiments on JSSP benchmarks show that the framework surpasses traditional methods, metaheuristics, and neural network-based scheduling in performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework dynamically optimizes JSSP scheduling through reinforcement learning and demonstrates superior makespan performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a policy-based deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic framework for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. The hyper-heuristic agent learns to switch scheduling rules based on the system state dynamically. We extend the hyper-heuristic framework with two key mechanisms. First, action prefiltering restricts decision-making to feasible low-level actions, enabling low-level heuristics to be evaluated independently of environmental constraints and providing an unbiased assessment. Second, a commitment mechanism regulates the frequency of heuristic switching. We investigate the impact of different commitment strategies, from step-wise switching to full-episode commitment, on both training behavior and makespan. Additionally, we compare two action selection strategies at the policy level: deterministic greedy selection and stochastic sampling. Computational experiments on standard JSSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Think-with-Me introduces an interactive reasoning paradigm to optimize reasoning efficiency in Large Reasoning Models with external feedback interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Reasoning Models struggle with inefficient reasoning processes (e.g., overthinking) and lack external mechanisms for intervention during reasoning.

Method: Think-with-Me incorporates transitional conjunctions as intervention points for external feedback during reasoning. Feedback is based on rationality and completeness evaluations, coming from humans or LLM proxies. A new training approach, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is used for adaptability.

Result: The model improves reasoning accuracy by 7.19% while reducing reasoning length by 81% compared to QwQ-32B on the AIME24 dataset under an 8K context window.

Conclusion: Think-with-Me efficiently balances accuracy and reasoning length, introducing an interactive reasoning paradigm suited for tasks in security and creativity.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at multi-step reasoning but often suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational cost and degrades performance. Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond superficial metrics like accuracy and F1 score in evaluating AI-human alignment and provide deeper insights into decision-making processes and misalignments.

Method: Developing a mechanism-based decision model that quantifies decision factors' importance and sensitivities. XChoice compares parameter vectors between human data and AI-generated decisions, tested on time-use data.

Result: Identified alignment heterogeneity and major misalignments in specific groups, such as Black and married individuals. Validated the robustness of the framework and tested a mitigation intervention.

Conclusion: XChoice offers a robust, mechanism-driven method to diagnose AI-human misalignments and enhances decision-making by going beyond surface-level evaluations.

Abstract: We present XChoice, an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making. Moving beyond outcome agreement such as accuracy and F1 score, XChoice fits a mechanism-based decision model to human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters that capture the relative importance of decision factors, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing these parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups. We demonstrate XChoice on Americans' daily time allocation using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) as human ground truth, revealing heterogeneous alignment across models and activities and salient misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. We further validate robustness of XChoice via an invariance analysis and evaluate targeted mitigation with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) intervention. Overall, XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive evaluation for agentic LLMs in physics-constrained, real-world tasks and explore their planning capabilities under strict constraints and diverse challenges in space-related domains.

Method: Developed AstroReason-Bench, a benchmark incorporating diverse Space Planning Problems with strict constraints and long-term decision-making, and tested open- and closed-source agentic LLMs against specialized solvers.

Result: Agentic LLMs demonstrated significant underperformance compared to specialized solvers, indicating their limitations in handling realistic and high-stakes tasks.

Conclusion: AstroReason-Bench serves as a valuable resource for diagnosing and improving the capabilities of agentic LLMs, setting a challenging standard for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as generalist planners capable of reasoning and acting across diverse tasks. However, existing agent benchmarks largely focus on symbolic or weakly grounded environments, leaving their performance in physics-constrained real-world domains underexplored. We introduce AstroReason-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic planning in Space Planning Problems (SPP), a family of high-stakes problems with heterogeneous objectives, strict physical constraints, and long-horizon decision-making. AstroReason-Bench integrates multiple scheduling regimes, including ground station communication and agile Earth observation, and provides a unified agent-oriented interaction protocol. Evaluating on a range of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source agentic LLM systems, we find that current agents substantially underperform specialized solvers, highlighting key limitations of generalist planning under realistic constraints. AstroReason-Bench offers a challenging and diagnostic testbed for future agentic research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the probe and solve algorithm for automated hyperparameter optimization in constraint programming solvers, outperforming default configurations using Bayesian optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual hyperparameter tuning for constraint programming solvers is challenging and inefficient, necessitating an automated method.

Method: The proposed algorithm integrates probing for hyperparameter exploration and solving using optimal configurations within a predefined time budget, implementing methods like Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search.

Result: Bayesian optimization improves the solver's default performance significantly for ACE and Choco, outperforming Hamming distance search.

Conclusion: Probe and solve algorithm provides an effective, resource-aware approach for optimizing constraint programming solvers, yielding consistent improvements.

Abstract: The performance of constraint programming solvers is highly sensitive to the choice of their hyperparameters. Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.
  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.
  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.

TL;DR: This study evaluates and extends an LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework to predict process outcomes, showing its effectiveness in data-scarce environments and its unique reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve process outcome predictions, especially in data-scarce settings, by leveraging the reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Method: The study extends an LLM-based framework, performing comprehensive evaluations for multiple Key Performance Indicators across three event logs, focusing on total time and activity occurrence prediction.

Result: Empirical evaluation reveals that the LLM surpasses benchmark methods in limited data settings (100 traces) and utilizes both prior knowledge and internal trace correlations effectively.

Conclusion: The LLM demonstrates superior performance in predictive process monitoring through higher-order reasoning, showcasing its adaptability and efficacy in complex prediction tasks.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve access to essential health services in Ethiopia's rural areas while optimizing the use of limited resources.

Method: The LEG framework merges optimization techniques for population coverage with iterative refinement by large language models to incorporate qualitative stakeholder input.

Result: Experiments in three Ethiopian regions showcase the framework’s ability to maximize population coverage while honoring expert qualitative preferences.

Conclusion: The LEG framework provides a novel and impactful method to inform equitable, data-driven health system prioritization in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combat sports lack AI-driven tactical analysis due to complex dynamics and unstructured data, necessitating advanced systems.

Method: BoxMind identifies atomic punches and uses a graph-based model with hierarchical indicators for outcome prediction and tactical recommendations.

Result: BoxMind achieved 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph, 87.5% on Olympic matches, and contributed to winning three gold and two silver medals for the Chinese team.

Conclusion: BoxMind showcases how AI can elevate competitive sports by converting unstructured video data into actionable strategic insights.

Abstract: Competitive sports require sophisticated tactical analysis, yet combat disciplines like boxing remain underdeveloped in AI-driven analytics due to the complexity of action dynamics and the lack of structured tactical representations. To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals. BoxMind establishes a replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging the gap between computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPCI-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating privacy adherence in multimodal agents, addressing key challenges in privacy-utility trade-offs and visual information leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess and improve the adherence of language-model agents, particularly multimodal proactive assistants, to social norms regarding privacy, as their roles shift towards handling personal data.

Method: The authors developed MPCI-Bench, a benchmark featuring paired positive/negative multimodal instances across three tiers: Seed judgments, Story reasoning, and agent action Traces, using a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline.

Result: State-of-the-art multimodal models were tested and showed significant failures in balancing privacy and utility, with higher leakage rates for sensitive visual information compared to textual.

Conclusion: Open-sourcing MPCI-Bench is aimed at advancing research on maintaining contextual integrity in agentic, multimodal settings.

Abstract: As language-model agents evolve from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that handle personal data, evaluating their adherence to social norms becomes increasingly critical, often through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). However, existing CI benchmarks are largely text-centric and primarily emphasize negative refusal scenarios, overlooking multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information. We will open-source MPCI-Bench to facilitate future research on agentic CI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast attention inference and decoding are necessary for applying large language models to resource-constrained edge accelerators.

Method: The authors developed SwiftKV Attention, a low-latency per-token pipelined algorithm, and designed SwiftKV-MHA, a specialized accelerator combining high precision attention with low precision computations.

Result: SwiftKV Attention achieves a 7.16* speedup over native attention on edge accelerators, while SwiftKV-MHA achieves a 13.48* latency reduction with 17.4% faster generation and 1.98* higher token efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable faster and more resource-efficient attention inference and decoding for large language models, tailored for edge devices.

Abstract: Edge acceleration for large language models is crucial for their widespread application; however, achieving fast attention inference and efficient decoding on resource-constrained edge accelerators remains challenging. This paper presents SwiftKV Attention, a per-token pipelined, low-latency single-pass attention inference algorithm, where every (kt, vt) in the KV cache is processed exactly once in a uniform per-token pipeline without score materialization, blockwise softmax, or a second pass, thereby enabling fast execution on edge accelerators with a single hardware set and no resource-intensive parallelism. Furthermore, to address the limited support for multi-head LLM decoding in existing accelerators, we design the SwiftKV-MHA accelerator, which enables high precision attention and low precision GEMV on the same processor array, achieving fast and efficient multi-head parallel decoding. Experimental results show that, on the edge accelerator, the SwiftKV Attention algorithm achieves a 7.16* speedup over native attention and significantly outperforms other attention algorithms. SwiftKV-MHA further reduces attention latency by 13.48*; under the same settings, it improves generation speed by 17.4% and increases token efficiency by 1.98* compared with state-of-the-art works.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RidgeWalker, a high-performance FPGA-based accelerator for Graph Random Walks (GRWs), achieving significant speedups over current FPGA and GPU solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite their applications, GRWs are challenging to optimize due to data dependencies, irregular memory access, and execution imbalances, and current FPGA solutions underperform due to inefficient architectures.

Method: RidgeWalker utilizes the Markov property of GRWs for task decomposition and implements an asynchronous pipeline architecture with feedback-driven scheduling based on queuing theory.

Result: RidgeWalker delivers an average speedup of 7.0x over FPGA solutions and 8.1x over GPU solutions, with peak speedups of up to 71.0x and 22.9x, respectively, validated on diverse algorithms and datasets.

Conclusion: RidgeWalker is an efficient and adaptive solution for enhancing GRW performance, showcasing the potential for FPGA-based datacenter acceleration, with publicly accessible source code for broader applications.

Abstract: Graph Random Walks (GRWs) offer efficient approximations of key graph properties and have been widely adopted in many applications. However, GRW workloads are notoriously difficult to accelerate due to their strong data dependencies, irregular memory access patterns, and imbalanced execution behavior. While recent work explores FPGA-based accelerators for GRWs, existing solutions fall far short of hardware potential due to inefficient pipelining and static scheduling. This paper presents RidgeWalker, a high-performance GRW accelerator designed for datacenter FPGAs. The key insight behind RidgeWalker is that the Markov property of GRWs allows decomposition into stateless, fine-grained tasks that can be executed out-of-order without compromising correctness. Building on this, RidgeWalker introduces an asynchronous pipeline architecture with a feedback-driven scheduler grounded in queuing theory, enabling perfect pipelining and adaptive load balancing. We prototype RidgeWalker on datacenter FPGAs and evaluated it across a range of GRW algorithms and real-world graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RidgeWalker achieves an average speedup of 7.0x over state-of-the-art FPGA solutions and 8.1x over GPU solutions, with peak speedups of up to 71.0x and 22.9x, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-intensive AI workloads struggle with the "memory wall" bottleneck. Approximate computing offers energy savings by leveraging error tolerance in AI applications.

Method: OpenACM provides an open-source compiler for designing approximate DCiM architectures. It integrates accuracy-configurable multipliers and automates architecture creation through a reproducible physical design flow.

Result: Using OpenACM, experiments on convolutional neural networks showed energy savings of up to 64%, with negligible loss in application accuracy.

Conclusion: OpenACM enables effective trade-offs between energy efficiency and computational accuracy through automated hardware design, making it highly accessible and reproducible as it leverages open-source tools.

Abstract: The rise of data-intensive AI workloads has exacerbated the ``memory wall'' bottleneck. Digital Compute-in-Memory (DCiM) using SRAM offers a scalable solution, but its vast design space makes manual design impractical, creating a need for automated compilers. A key opportunity lies in approximate computing, which leverages the error tolerance of AI applications for significant energy savings. However, existing DCiM compilers focus on exact arithmetic, failing to exploit this optimization. This paper introduces OpenACM, the first open-source, accuracy-aware compiler for SRAM-based approximate DCiM architectures. OpenACM bridges the gap between application error tolerance and hardware automation. Its key contribution is an integrated library of accuracy-configurable multipliers (exact, tunable approximate, and logarithmic), enabling designers to make fine-grained accuracy-energy trade-offs. The compiler automates the generation of the DCiM architecture, integrating a transistor-level customizable SRAM macro with variation-aware characterization into a complete, open-source physical design flow based on OpenROAD and the FreePDK45 library. This ensures full reproducibility and accessibility, removing dependencies on proprietary tools. Experimental results on representative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate that OpenACM achieves energy savings of up to 64\% with negligible loss in application accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in LLMs' reasoning capabilities in discrete and game-theoretic tasks, focusing on improving decision quality under uncertainty.

Method: It integrates in-context learning with entropy-aware chain-of-thought reasoning, dynamically adjusting context and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty.

Result: The framework improved decision outcomes significantly from -11.6% to +9.5% average change in game results compared to a baseline LLM, validated through statistical analysis and reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided adaptive reasoning enhances performance and decision quality of LLMs in sequential tasks, demonstrating its viability in game-theoretic environments.

Abstract: We propose a novel LLM-based framework for reasoning in discrete, game-theoretic tasks, illustrated with \emph{Tic-Tac-Toe}. The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \(-11.6\%\) with the baseline LLM to \(+9.5\%\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments.

*Syed Waqas Zamir,Wassim Hamidouche,Boulbaba Ben Amor,Luana Marotti,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Juan Lavista Ferres*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a framework to enhance LLMs for low-resource languages, achieving notable performance improvements and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inequity in performance of LLMs for low-resource languages due to the global imbalance in digital resources available for such languages.

Method: BYOL uses a language resource classification system to tailor integration and development pathways. It employs techniques like corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, and machine translation for low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages.

Result: Using BYOL, improved language models were created for Chichewa and Maori, showing a 12% performance boost on average, and translation systems for extreme-low-resource languages like Inuktitut improved benchmarks significantly.

Conclusion: BYOL framework effectively enhances LLM capabilities for low-resource languages, preserving multilingual performance and significantly improving inclusivity and accessibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet remain fundamentally constrained by the severe imbalance in global language resources. While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol .

### [32] [A Concise Agent is Less Expert: Revealing Side Effects of Using Style Features on Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10809)
*Young-Min Cho,Yuan Yuan,Sharath Chandra Guntuku,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies unintended side effects of stylistic features in prompts for LLM conversational agents, finding that style traits are deeply interconnected rather than independently controllable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration into how the interaction of stylistic features like concise or friendly impacts overall conversational agent performance, given the assumption of independent style control.

Method: Surveyed 127 papers for commonly used style features, designed synthetic dialogues and pairwise evaluation frameworks using LLM as Judge to measure cross-feature effects.

Result: Uncovered structured side effects, such as a prompt for conciseness reducing perceived expertise. Developed a dataset titled CASSE, and evaluated mitigation strategies that show partial success but degrade primary intended styles.

Conclusion: Faithful style control in LLMs is complex due to entangled style traits. Calls for multi-objective strategies to improve stylistic steering in conversational agents.

Abstract: Style features such as friendly, helpful, or concise are widely used in prompts to steer the behavior of Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agents, yet their unintended side effects remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic study of cross-feature stylistic side effects. We conduct a comprehensive survey of 127 conversational agent papers from ACL Anthology and identify 12 frequently used style features. Using controlled, synthetic dialogues across task-oriented and open domain settings, we quantify how prompting for one style feature causally affects others via a pairwise LLM as a Judge evaluation framework. Our results reveal consistent and structured side effects, such as prompting for conciseness significantly reduces perceived expertise. They demonstrate that style features are deeply entangled rather than orthogonal. To support future research, we introduce CASSE (Conversational Agent Stylistic Side Effects), a dataset capturing these complex interactions. We further evaluate prompt based and activation steering based mitigation strategies and find that while they can partially restore suppressed traits, they often degrade the primary intended style. These findings challenge the assumption of faithful style control in LLMs and highlight the need for multi-objective and more principled approaches to safe, targeted stylistic steering in conversational agents.

*Junsol Kim,Shiyang Lai,Nino Scherrer,Blaise Agüera y Arcas,James Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how effective reasoning in language models arises from multi-agent-like interactions within the model, termed as "a society of thought," rather than merely from extended computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover the mechanisms driving the superior reasoning capabilities of advanced language models, focusing on why certain models outperform others in complex cognitive tasks.

Method: The study employs quantitative analysis, mechanistic interpretability techniques, reinforcement learning, and conversational scaffolding to investigate the internal reasoning dynamics of models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B.

Result: The study identifies that reasoning models achieve greater accuracy by simulating diverse, multi-agent-like interactions with distinct personality and expertise traits, enhancing exploration of solution spaces through conversational mechanisms.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a computational analogy to collective human intelligence, where structured diversity improves problem-solving. This opens avenues for organizing models to mimic crowd wisdom for more advanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities across domains, yet mechanisms underlying sophisticated reasoning remain elusive. Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds.

*Guy Hadad,Neomi Rabaev,Bracha Shapira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EncodeRec is a recommendation approach enhancing pre-trained language model embeddings to better align with recommendation objectives, achieving better domain-specific representation and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of embeddings from pre-trained language models in recommendation systems, which lack structured, domain-specific representation capabilities critical for recommendation tasks.

Method: The authors propose EncodeRec, which aligns textual representations with recommendation tasks, utilizing frozen language model parameters while learning compact embeddings from item descriptions.

Result: EncodeRec demonstrates significant performance improvements over PLM-based and embedding model baselines in key recommendation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Embedding adaptation, as presented in EncodeRec, is essential to bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and specialized recommender systems.

Abstract: Recent recommender systems increasingly leverage embeddings from large pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, such embeddings exhibit two key limitations: (1) PLMs are not explicitly optimized to produce structured and discriminative embedding spaces, and (2) their representations remain overly generic, often failing to capture the domain-specific semantics crucial for recommendation tasks. We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems.

*Parisa Rabbani,Priyam Sahoo,Ruben Mathew,Aishee Mondal,Harshita Ketharaman,Nimet Beyza Bozdag,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how large language models (LLMs) judge claims in different dialogue contexts and introduces a framework (DialDefer) to analyze and mitigate these inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the reliability of LLMs as third-party judges in dialogues, focusing on how judgments change when content is framed differently.

Method: The authors propose DialDefer, a framework that includes a Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) to quantify framing-induced shifts. They analyze over 3,000 instances across four models in nine domains.

Result: Conversational framing causes significant judgment shifts (up to 87pp DDS), while overall model accuracy remains stable. LLMs display domain-dependent deference or skepticism, with the most significant shifts tied to human-vs-AI attribution.

Conclusion: The inconsistencies in judgment stem from framing effects, posing challenges that go beyond simple accuracy optimization. They highlight the need for calibration-focused mitigation strategies.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used as third-party judges, yet their reliability when evaluating speakers in dialogue remains poorly understood. We show that LLMs judge identical claims differently depending on framing: the same content elicits different verdicts when presented as a statement to verify ("Is this statement correct?") versus attributed to a speaker ("Is this speaker correct?"). We call this dialogic deference and introduce DialDefer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these framing-induced judgment shifts. Our Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) captures directional shifts that aggregate accuracy obscures. Across nine domains, 3k+ instances, and four models, conversational framing induces large shifts (|DDS| up to 87pp, p < .0001) while accuracy remains stable (<2pp), with effects amplifying 2-4x on naturalistic Reddit conversations. Models can shift toward agreement (deference) or disagreement (skepticism) depending on domain -- the same model ranges from DDS = -53 on graduate-level science to +58 on social judgment. Ablations reveal that human-vs-LLM attribution drives the largest shifts (17.7pp swing), suggesting models treat disagreement with humans as more costly than with AI. Mitigation attempts reduce deference but can over-correct into skepticism, framing this as a calibration problem beyond accuracy optimization.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new approach to automatically construct unweighted finite-state transducers (FSTs) based on hidden states learned by recurrent neural networks. It achieves significant accuracy improvements over existing methods across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building finite-state transducers manually is challenging despite their effectiveness in string-to-string rewriting tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a technique to automatically construct unweighted FSTs using the geometry of hidden states learned by recurrent neural networks.

Result: The automatically constructed FSTs demonstrate high accuracy and robustness, achieving up to 87% improvement over classical algorithms across real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for constructing unweighted FSTs and significantly outperforms traditional approaches in accuracy, showcasing its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Finite-State Transducers (FSTs) are effective models for string-to-string rewriting tasks, often providing the efficiency necessary for high-performance applications, but constructing transducers by hand is difficult. In this work, we propose a novel method for automatically constructing unweighted FSTs following the hidden state geometry learned by a recurrent neural network. We evaluate our methods on real-world datasets for morphological inflection, grapheme-to-phoneme prediction, and historical normalization, showing that the constructed FSTs are highly accurate and robust for many datasets, substantially outperforming classical transducer learning algorithms by up to 87% accuracy on held-out test sets.

*Michael Ginn,Lindia Tjuatja,Enora Rice,Ali Marashian,Maria Valentini,Jasmine Xu,Graham Neubig,Alexis Palmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a new neural model, PolyGloss, that improves interlinear gloss predictions by simultaneously performing morphological segmentation, addressing key usability issues in real-world linguistic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art models like GlossLM generate glosses but fail to identify morpheme boundaries, reducing interpretability and trustworthiness for linguists using them in real-world tasks.

Method: The study explores joint training of models for interlinear gloss prediction and morphological segmentation using a multilingual seq2seq model called PolyGloss. The model was pretrained with an extended GlossLM training corpus and fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation for new datasets.

Result: PolyGloss outperforms GlossLM in glossing and surpasses open-source large language models in segmentation, glossing, and task alignment.

Conclusion: Joint prediction of glosses and morphological segmentation significantly improves linguistic tool utility. PolyGloss addresses critical gaps left by earlier models and offers adaptable solutions for new datasets.

Abstract: Automated interlinear gloss prediction with neural networks is a promising approach to accelerate language documentation efforts. However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.
  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text. We run experiments to determine the optimal way to train models that balance segmentation and glossing accuracy, as well as the alignment between the two tasks. We extend the training corpus of GlossLM and pretrain PolyGloss, a family of seq2seq multilingual models for joint segmentation and glossing that outperforms GlossLM on glossing and beats various open-source LLMs on segmentation, glossing, and alignment. In addition, we demonstrate that PolyGloss can be quickly adapted to a new dataset via low-rank adaptation.

*Dustin S. Stoltz,Marshall A. Taylor,Sanuj Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes criteria for social scientists to select from available pretrained language models (LLMs), emphasizing the importance of model openness and the need for validating computational measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social scientists face challenges in selecting from thousands of available pretrained language models. This paper aims to assist in making more informed and reliable choices based on scientific principles.

Method: The authors explore key factors like model openness, footprint, training data, and architecture, arguing for the importance of validating and replicating findings through smaller open models and creating specific benchmarks.

Result: Validation and replicability are identified as crucial aspects in language model selection. Emphasis is laid on ex-post validation and demonstrable benchmarks for the entire computational process.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that starting with smaller, open models and focusing on the replicability and validity of computational processes is a sound approach for social scientists selecting language models.

Abstract: Currently, there are thousands of large pretrained language models (LLMs) available to social scientists. How do we select among them? Using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as guides, we explore the significance of: (1) model openness, (2) model footprint, (3) training data, and (4) model architectures and fine-tuning. While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post). Replicability, in particular, is a more pressing guide for selecting language models. Being able to reliably replicate a particular finding that entails the use of a language model necessitates reliably reproducing a task. To this end, we propose starting with smaller, open models, and constructing delimited benchmarks to demonstrate the validity of the entire computational pipeline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim) aimed at improving the realism of clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a novel framework to enhance patient role-playing in these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to simulating clinical interactions largely use generic or generated data that lacks authenticity and diversity, limiting their effectiveness in advancing medical diagnostic education and clinical LLMs.

Method: The authors created a Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim) using realistic scenarios and developed a Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing (MSPRP) framework to improve model personalization and realism by decomposing interactions into three stages.

Result: The Ch-PatientSim dataset and MSPRP framework demonstrated significant improvements in clinical LLMs' ability to emulate patient behavior realistically and diversely. However, most existing LLMs still produced overly formal and impersonal responses.

Conclusion: The paper presents a meaningful step towards creating more authentic and diverse clinical interaction simulations by leveraging a novel dataset and framework. This work highlights the gaps in existing models while offering an effective training-free approach to address these challenges.

Abstract: The simulation of realistic clinical interactions plays a pivotal role in advancing clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) and supporting medical diagnostic education. Existing approaches and benchmarks rely on generic or LLM-generated dialogue data, which limits the authenticity and diversity of doctor-patient interactions. In this work, we propose the first Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim), constructed from realistic clinical interaction scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the performance of models in emulating patient behavior. Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification. We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing (MSPRP) framework, which decomposes interactions into three stages to ensure both personalization and realism in model responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves model performance across multiple dimensions of patient simulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free logit intervention method for steering LLMs at inference, addressing limitations of existing approaches like prompting and activation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, steering LLMs for tasks like style adaptation and toxicity control is difficult, as prompting lacks consistency and activation approaches demand deep model access.

Method: The proposed method derives statistical token score tables using z-normalized log-odds to influence decoding distribution during inference.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate enhanced control of LLM outputs, achieving notable gains such as +47% accuracy and 50x F1 for multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Logit intervention is effective, task-agnostic, and offers consistent, fine-grained control improvements for steering LLM behavior.

Abstract: Steering LLMs is essential for specialized applications such as style-sensitive text rewriting, user-adaptive communication, and toxicity mitigation. Current steering methods, such as prompting-based and activation-based approaches, are widely used to guide model behavior. However, activation-based techniques require deep access to internal layers, while prompting-based steering often fails to provide consistent or fine-grained control. In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZPD Detector, a framework for dynamic data selection based on the Zone of Proximal Development, optimizing training by aligning sample difficulty with model capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models is increasingly costly and limited by the availability of high-quality training data. Optimizing data selection or synthesis under constrained budgets is key to improving training efficiency.

Method: The proposed ZPD Detector dynamically selects training data by modeling the relationship between sample difficulty and the model's capability using the Zone of Proximal Development framework. Methods include difficulty calibration, model capability estimation using Item Response Theory, and a matching score to prioritize informative samples.

Result: ZPD Detector improves training efficiency by dynamically aligning model capability with sample difficulty, enabling better data utilization and insights into designing training strategies.

Conclusion: ZPD Detector showcases a dynamic approach to data selection, which can significantly enhance the training of language models. This method holds potential to influence future training strategy designs and improve resource efficiency.

Abstract: As the cost of training large language models continues to increase and high-quality training data become increasingly scarce, selecting high-value samples or synthesizing effective training data under limited data budgets has emerged as a critical research problem. Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design. All code and data will be released after our work be accepted to support reproducible researc

*Zhongxiang Sun,Yi Zhan,Chenglei Shen,Weijie Yu,Xiao Zhang,Ming He,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of factual inaccuracies in personalized language models and proposes a method to maintain factual accuracy while preserving personalized behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized LLMs often prioritize user biases or prior history, potentially spreading incorrect information, highlighting the need to address factual distortions caused by personalization.

Method: The authors propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time method. They also introduce a benchmark called PFQABench to evaluate factual and personalized performance under personalization.

Result: Experiments with various LLMs show that FPPS significantly improves factual accuracy while retaining personalized behavior.

Conclusion: FPPS offers an effective solution to mitigate factual distortions in personalized LLMs, ensuring accurate and personalized user experiences.

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) adapt model behavior to individual users to enhance user satisfaction, yet personalization can inadvertently distort factual reasoning. We show that when personalized LLMs face factual queries, there exists a phenomenon where the model generates answers aligned with a user's prior history rather than the objective truth, resulting in personalization-induced hallucinations that degrade factual reliability and may propagate incorrect beliefs, due to representational entanglement between personalization and factual representations. To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior. We further introduce PFQABench, the first benchmark designed to jointly evaluate factual and personalized question answering under personalization. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show that FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy while maintaining personalized performance.

TL;DR: This paper expands the action space for Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) with novel adaptive actions, improving translation quality and reducing delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SiMT policies limited to only READ/WRITE actions struggle with real-time constraints while maintaining high-quality translations. The study aims to address this limitation.

Method: The paper introduces four adaptive actions—Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization, and Pronominalization—integrated into a large language model (LLM) framework. Action-aware prompting creates training references, and a latency-aware TTS pipeline evaluates both translation quality and timing.

Result: Experiments on English-Chinese, English-German, and English-Japanese translation benchmarks show improved semantic metrics and reduced delays. Combining Drop and Sentence_Cut achieves a better fluency-latency balance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Expanding the action space in LLM-based SiMT frameworks aids in achieving more human-like real-time translations with better balance of quality and latency.

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations under strict real-time constraints, which traditional policies with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization and Pronominalization, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines. Notably, combining Drop and Sentence_Cut leads to consistent improvements in the balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of poor confidence calibration in large language models (LLMs), especially in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups, by proposing a principled and effective noise-aware calibration method called NAACL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large language models in factual domains demands accurate confidence calibration due to frequent issues like overconfidence caused by noisy, irrelevant, or contradictory contextual evidence during retrieval.

Method: The authors introduce NAACL Rules for handling noise-aware confidence calibration and propose a calibration framework (NAACL) that leverages supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on data synthesized from 2K HotpotQA examples, based on these rules.

Result: NAACL improves calibration performance, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain, enabling better confidence calibration even without stronger teacher models.

Conclusion: NAACL offers a promising framework that bridges the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration in LLMs, fostering accurate and reliable confidence assessments in mission-critical applications.

Abstract: Accurately assessing model confidence is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in mission-critical factual domains. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) manage translation without fine-tuning, using Sparse Autoencoders to pinpoint the features responsible for translation initiation and proposing methods to enhance fine-tuning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how LLMs inherently perform translation tasks without needing fine-tuning, addressing the opacity of their internal processes.

Method: They use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify features often activated during translation. These features are refined using a PCA-based consistency metric and tested via causal interventions to validate their role in translation.

Result: The results reveal specific translation initiation features critical to translation accuracy. Amplifying these features improves translation, and selectively training on complex samples enhances fine-tuning efficiency and suppresses hallucinations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into translation mechanisms in LLMs, offering strategies for efficient fine-tuning and demonstrating transferable mechanisms to larger models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit strong translation abilities, even without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models. The codes are available at https://github.com/flamewei123/AAAI26-translation-Initiation-Features.

### [46] [From Interpretability to Performance: Optimizing Retrieval Heads for Long-Context Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11020)
*Youmi Ma,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the function of retrieval heads in LLMs and introduces RetMask, a method improving long-context capabilities by leveraging retrieval heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of retrieval heads in enhancing model performance and demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability insights can improve the long-context capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The authors propose RetMask, a method that contrasts normal outputs with ablated variants where retrieval heads are masked, creating training signals to refine the model's performance.

Result: RetMask achieves significant improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K, +70% in generation with citation, +32% in passage re-ranking, and maintains general task performance. The method works best in models with concentrated retrieval head organization.

Conclusion: Mechanistic understanding of retrieval heads leads to performance gains, and RetMask confirms the relationship between retrieval heads and long-context capabilities. This approach translates mechanistic insights into practical improvements.

Abstract: Advances in mechanistic interpretability have identified special attention heads, known as retrieval heads, that are responsible for retrieving information from the context. However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains. This mechanistic relationship validates the function of retrieval heads and demonstrates that mechanistic insights can be transformed into performance enhancements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines large language models' reasoning with limited computing budgets, introducing the 'Anytime Index' metric and a self-improvement mechanism to enhance model efficiency and intermediate solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to develop computationally efficient language models that can provide quality intermediate solutions within fixed reasoning constraints for tasks like trip planning.

Method: Developed the Anytime Index to measure solution effectiveness relative to increased reasoning tokens and implemented inference-time self-improvement using model-generated preference data.

Result: Experiments on datasets showed improvements in reasoning quality and processing efficiency across various models, such as GPT-4, Grok-3, and LLaMA.

Conclusion: The methods improve solution quality and efficiency for large language models under computation constraints, making them suitable for real-world applications requiring quick and effective intermediate outputs.

Abstract: We study the reasoning behavior of large language models (LLMs) under limited computation budgets. In such settings, producing useful partial solutions quickly is often more practical than exhaustive reasoning, which incurs high inference costs. Many real-world tasks, such as trip planning, require models to deliver the best possible output within a fixed reasoning budget. We introduce an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index, a metric that quantifies how effectively solution quality improves as reasoning tokens increase. To further enhance efficiency, we propose an inference-time self-improvement method using LLM-synthesized preference data, where models learn from their own reasoning comparisons to produce better intermediate solutions. Experiments on NaturalPlan (Trip), AIME, and GPQA datasets show consistent gains across Grok-3, GPT-oss, GPT-4.1/4o, and LLaMA models, improving both reasoning quality and efficiency under budget constraints.

*Chi Zhang,Mengqi Zhang,Xiaotian Ye,Runxi Cheng,Zisheng Zhou,Ying Zhou,Pengjie Ren,Zhumin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the issue of catastrophic collapse in large language models during sequential knowledge editing and proposes the REVIVE framework to mitigate it by preserving dominant singular directions in pretrained weight matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for knowledge editing in language models degrade general abilities due to insufficient understanding of why catastrophic collapse occurs.

Method: The authors conducted spectral analysis to identify the impact of repeated edits on dominant singular directions of weight matrices. They introduced REVIVE, a framework that represents parameter updates in spectral basis and filters interference in critical subspaces.

Result: REVIVE improves editing efficacy and maintains general abilities across extensive experiments, including sequential editing scenarios with up to 20,000 edits.

Conclusion: Preserving dominant singular subspace stabilizes sequential knowledge editing, which helps avoid catastrophic model collapse and maintains overall performance.

Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing in large language models often causes catastrophic collapse of the model's general abilities, especially for parameter-modifying methods. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits.

*Yuanxiang Liu,Songze Li,Xiaoke Guo,Zhaoyan Gong,Qifei Zhang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoG, a framework to enhance Large Language Models' reasoning by combining intuition and analytical methods to address challenges of instability and reasoning stagnation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often face reliability issues such as hallucinations and challenges with reasoning stagnation when augmented with Knowledge Graphs.

Method: CoG is a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory, using Relational Blueprint Guidance for fast stabilization and Failure-Aware Refinement for analytical backtracking to overcome reasoning hurdles.

Result: Experimental evaluation on three benchmarks shows CoG surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The CoG framework improves reasoning reliability and efficiency by mimicking dual cognitive processes, addressing instability and stagnation effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities but often grapple with reliability challenges like hallucinations. While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that CoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create a computationally efficient and accurate model for classifying names by language and entity type, addressing scalability and energy consumption issues in NLP.

Method: The authors use a fine-tuned CNN architecture (Onomas-CNN X) that combines parallel convolution branches, depthwise-separable operations, and hierarchical classification to improve efficiency on CPU hardware.

Result: Onomas-CNN X achieves 92.1% accuracy, processes 2,813 names per second on a single CPU core, and is 46 times faster and more energy-efficient than fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa.

Conclusion: Specialized CNN architectures like Onomas-CNN X can match the performance of large pre-trained models for specific NLP tasks with enough training data, while being more energy-efficient.

Abstract: We present a convolutional neural network approach for classifying proper names by language and entity type. Our model, Onomas-CNN X, combines parallel convolution branches with depthwise-separable operations and hierarchical classification to process names efficiently on CPU hardware. We evaluate the architecture on a large multilingual dataset covering 104 languages and four entity types (person, organization, location, other). Onomas-CNN X achieves 92.1% accuracy while processing 2,813 names per second on a single CPU core - 46 times faster than fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa with comparable accuracy. The model reduces energy consumption by a factor of 46 compared to transformer baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that specialized CNN architectures remain competitive with large pre-trained models for focused NLP tasks when sufficient training data exists.

*Ashish Raj Shekhar,Shiven Agarwal,Priyanuj Bordoloi,Yash Shah,Tejas Anvekar,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Integrity Shield," a tool that embeds invisible watermarks into exam PDFs to prevent AI systems from solving them and help detect academic misconduct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns about academic integrity due to the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve exams directly from uploaded PDFs prompted the need for a solution to counteract their misuse.

Method: The authors developed "Integrity Shield," a watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs without altering visible exam content. The system targets proprietary black-box LLMs.

Result: Integrity Shield demonstrates 91-94% effectiveness in blocking LLMs from solving shielded exams and 89-93% success in retrieving watermark signatures across various commercial LLMs and exam types.

Conclusion: Integrity Shield offers a robust solution to mitigate academic dishonesty by preventing AI from answering watermarked exams and enabling reliable detection of tampered or unauthorized usage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can now solve entire exams directly from uploaded PDF assessments, raising urgent concerns about academic integrity and the reliability of grades and credentials. Existing watermarking techniques either operate at the token level or assume control over the model's decoding process, making them ineffective when students query proprietary black-box systems with instructor-provided documents. We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged. These watermarks consistently prevent MLLMs from answering shielded exam PDFs and encode stable, item-level signatures that can be reliably recovered from model or student responses. Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance & authorship evidence.

*Taja Kuzman Pungeršek,Peter Rupnik,Vít Suchomel,Nikola Ljubešić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study enhances web-based corpora for South Slavic languages by iterative crawling, creating the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus containing 17 billion words across seven languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To continuously and comprehensively collect texts in less-resourced South Slavic and related languages to support linguistic research and resource development.

Method: Established continuous and iterative crawling of national top-level domains for South Slavic languages and added features like topic labeling alongside genre categorization.

Result: Created CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus with 17 billion words in 38.1 million texts, significantly larger than its predecessor, with mostly fresh content generated through new crawls.

Conclusion: While iterative crawling yields valuable and extensive new content, it also faces challenges like the increasing prevalence of low-quality, machine-generated web content.

Abstract: Crawling national top-level domains has proven to be highly effective for collecting texts in less-resourced languages. This approach has been recently used for South Slavic languages and resulted in the largest general corpora for this language group: the CLASSLA-web 1.0 corpora. Building on this success, we established a continuous crawling infrastructure for iterative national top-level domain crawling across South Slavic and related webs. We present the first outcome of this crawling infrastructure - the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus collection, with substantially larger web corpora containing 17.0 billion words in 38.1 million texts in seven languages: Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian, and Slovenian. In addition to genre categories, the new version is also automatically annotated with topic labels. Comparing CLASSLA-web 2.0 with its predecessor reveals that only one-fifth of the texts overlap, showing that re-crawling after just two years yields largely new content. However, while the new web crawls bring growing gains, we also notice growing pains - a manual inspection of top domains reveals a visible degradation of web content, as machine-generated sites now contribute a significant portion of texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in DocRE due to cross-sentence dependencies and the data scarcity for long-tail relations, which impede model performance and generalization.

Method: DOREMI adopts an iterative framework that selectively annotates the most informative underrepresented examples, enhancing training efficiency without relying on noisy or heuristic datasets.

Result: DOREMI demonstrates its ability to reduce biases and improve generalization for rare relations, while being adaptable to any pre-existing DocRE model.

Conclusion: DOREMI presents a scalable and efficient solution to enhance performance on long-tail relation types, making it robust and effective for DocRE tasks.

Abstract: Document-Level Relation Extraction (DocRE) presents significant challenges due to its reliance on cross-sentence context and the long-tail distribution of relation types, where many relations have scarce training examples. In this work, we introduce DOcument-level Relation Extraction optiMizing the long taIl (DOREMI), an iterative framework that enhances underrepresented relations through minimal yet targeted manual annotations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on large-scale noisy data or heuristic denoising, DOREMI actively selects the most informative examples to improve training efficiency and robustness. DOREMI can be applied to any existing DocRE model and is effective at mitigating long-tail biases, offering a scalable solution to improve generalization on rare relations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable higher-parallelism decoding for masked diffusion language models (MDMs) in math reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance.

Method: A curriculum-based approach using TraceRL to progressively scale block sizes and transition smoothly from AR-initialized small blocks.

Result: Higher-parallelism decoding is achieved with minimal performance degradation, and an alternative decoding schedule ($\hat{\rm S}$) with comparable performance is proposed.

Abstract: We present T$^\star$, a simple \textsc{TraceRL}-based training curriculum for progressive block-size scaling in masked diffusion language models (MDMs). Starting from an AR-initialized small-block MDM, T$^\star$~transitions smoothly to larger blocks, enabling higher-parallelism decoding with minimal performance degradation on math reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, further analysis suggests that T$^\star$~can converge to an alternative decoding schedule $\hat{\rm S}$ that achieves comparable performance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the growing challenge of online disinformation by introducing MultiCaption, a dataset for detecting contradictions in multilingual and multimedia visual claims, and evaluates it with state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to improve automated fact-checking, which is limited by a lack of datasets that comprehensively reflect the complexities of multilingual and multimedia misinformation.

Method: The authors developed MultiCaption, a dataset of 11,088 labeled visual claims in 64 languages, and evaluated its usefulness for misinformation detection using transformer-based models and natural language inference techniques.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that MultiCaption poses greater challenges than conventional NLI tasks. Multilingual training and testing significantly enhance performance, enabling better multilingual fact-checking systems without machine translation.

Conclusion: MultiCaption offers a robust resource for advancing multimodal and multilingual misinformation detection, setting a strong foundation for future research in automated fact-checking.

Abstract: Online disinformation poses an escalating threat to society, driven increasingly by the rapid spread of misleading content across both multimedia and multilingual platforms. While automated fact-checking methods have advanced in recent years, their effectiveness remains constrained by the scarcity of datasets that reflect these real-world complexities. To address this gap, we first present MultiCaption, a new dataset specifically designed for detecting contradictions in visual claims. Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments. We then provide comprehensive experiments using transformer-based architectures, natural language inference models, and large language models, establishing strong baselines for future research. The results show that MultiCaption is more challenging than standard NLI tasks, requiring task-specific finetuning for strong performance. Moreover, the gains from multilingual training and testing highlight the dataset's potential for building effective multilingual fact-checking pipelines without relying on machine translation.

### [56] [Language of Thought Shapes Output Diversity in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11227)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies the use of multilingual 'language of thought' as a structural source to enhance output diversity in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve output diversity in large language models to encourage pluralism and creativity.

Method: Studied multilingual thinking language strategies (Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling) to test the impact on output diversity in English responses.

Result: Switching to non-English thinking languages significantly increased output diversity, with greater effects from languages further from English.

Conclusion: Using multiple thinking languages boosts diversity, enabling broader cultural coverage and pluralistic alignment in outputs.

Abstract: Output diversity is crucial for Large Language Models as it underpins pluralism and creativity. In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate factually incorrect responses, necessitating effective methods to improve factuality without extensive retraining.

Method: The authors propose FactCorrector, a post-hoc correction method driven by structured feedback about the original response's factuality and adaptable across domains without the need for retraining.

Result: The FactCorrector significantly enhances factual accuracy on both the new VELI5 benchmark and other long-form factuality datasets, surpassing baseline methods while maintaining relevance.

Conclusion: FactCorrector demonstrates a promising approach to enhancing the factual precision of language model outputs using structured feedback and can adapt across domains efficiently.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in knowledge-intensive applications but often generate factually incorrect responses. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is correcting LLMs using feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce FactCorrector, a new post-hoc correction method that adapts across domains without retraining and leverages structured feedback about the factuality of the original response to generate a correction. To support rigorous evaluations of factuality correction methods, we also develop the VELI5 benchmark, a novel dataset containing systematically injected factual errors and ground-truth corrections. Experiments on VELI5 and several popular long-form factuality datasets show that the FactCorrector approach significantly improves factual precision while preserving relevance, outperforming strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of ambiguous examples produced by LLMs in intent recognition tasks, especially in low-resource scenarios.

Method: Employ Sentence Transformers to detect augmented examples semantically closer to untargeted intents and iteratively regenerate less ambiguous data.

Result: Sentence embedding-based approach reduces ambiguity in synthetic examples and enhances classification performance in loosely/broadly defined intent recognition scenarios.

Conclusion: The iterative use of Sentence Transformers and regeneration methodology effectively mitigates ambiguity, improving intent recognition in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective for data augmentation in classification tasks like intent detection. In some cases, they inadvertently produce examples that are ambiguous with regard to untargeted classes. We present DDAIR (Disambiguated Data Augmentation for Intent Recognition) to mitigate this problem. We use Sentence Transformers to detect ambiguous class-guided augmented examples generated by LLMs for intent recognition in low-resource scenarios. We identify synthetic examples that are semantically more similar to another intent than to their target one. We also provide an iterative re-generation method to mitigate such ambiguities. Our findings show that sentence embeddings effectively help to (re)generate less ambiguous examples, and suggest promising potential to improve classification performance in scenarios where intents are loosely or broadly defined.

TL;DR: RT-RAG improves multi-hop question answering by introducing a hierarchical framework with reasoning trees, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence in multi-hop QA caused by inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation in RAG approaches.

Method: RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into reasoning trees using structured entity analysis and tree selection, and employs bottom-up traversal with iterative query refinement.

Result: RT-RAG achieves 7.0% F1 and 6.0% exact match improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RT-RAG demonstrates the effectiveness of hierarchical reasoning and structured decomposition in enhancing multi-hop QA accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-hop question answering (QA). For multi-hop QA tasks, current iterative approaches predominantly rely on LLMs to self-guide and plan multi-step exploration paths during retrieval, leading to substantial challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence across steps from inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation. To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation. Comprehensive experiments show that RT-RAG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM, demonstrating the effectiveness of RT-RAG in complex multi-hop QA.

*Malin Astrid Larsson,Harald Fosen Grunnaleite,Vinay Setty*

TL;DR: The paper explores multi-task learning (MTL) for automated fact-checking using small decoder-only language models as an efficient approach compared to fine-tuning multiple models for specialized tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve automated fact-checking pipelines by making them more efficient and sustainable without relying on proprietary large language models or multiple specialized models.

Method: Proposes multi-task learning (MTL) strategies using small decoder-only LLMs to jointly perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection. The study evaluates these strategies across various configurations.

Result: MTL models showed significant relative gains (e.g., up to 44%, 54%, and 31% improvements) in claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection compared to zero-/few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: MTL with LLMs is a promising approach for automated fact-checking, yielding substantial efficiency and performance improvements. Practical guidelines are also provided for implementation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping automated fact-checking (AFC) by enabling unified, end-to-end verification pipelines rather than isolated components. While large proprietary models achieve strong performance, their closed weights, complexity, and high costs limit sustainability. Fine-tuning smaller open weight models for individual AFC tasks can help but requires multiple specialized models resulting in high costs. We propose \textbf{multi-task learning (MTL)} as a more efficient alternative that fine-tunes a single model to perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection jointly. Using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b), we explore three MTL strategies: classification heads, causal language modeling heads, and instruction-tuning, and evaluate them across model sizes, task orders, and standard non-LLM baselines. While multitask models do not universally surpass single-task baselines, they yield substantial improvements, achieving up to \textbf{44\%}, \textbf{54\%}, and \textbf{31\%} relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings. Finally, we also provide practical, empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners apply MTL with LLMs for automated fact-checking.

TL;DR: This paper proposes SimMIA, a new framework for Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) in black-box scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results using only generated text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference techniques for opaque LLMs are either reliant on inaccessible internal model details or fail to generalize effectively across domains in black-box settings.

Method: The paper introduces SimMIA, a robust framework using advanced sampling strategies and scoring mechanisms tailored for black-box MIAs. It also provides a new benchmark, WikiMIA-25, for evaluating these attacks.

Result: SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in black-box settings, comparable to methods relying on internal model data.

Conclusion: With SimMIA and the WikiMIA-25 benchmark, the work paves the way for effective and generalizable membership inference on proprietary LLMs under text-only scenarios.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) act as a crucial auditing tool for the opaque training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing techniques predominantly rely on inaccessible model internals (e.g., logits) or suffer from poor generalization across domains in strict black-box settings where only generated text is available. In this work, we propose SimMIA, a robust MIA framework tailored for this text-only regime by leveraging an advanced sampling strategy and scoring mechanism. Furthermore, we present WikiMIA-25, a new benchmark curated to evaluate MIA performance on modern proprietary LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art results in the black-box setting, rivaling baselines that exploit internal model information.

Result: The system demonstrates control over speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational actions like backchanneling and interruptions, and dialogue initiation, all efficiently trained under typical academic constraints.

Conclusion: The research provides a reproducible, instruction-following full-duplex speech model that enables dynamic and controllable conversational attributes for advancements in spoken conversational systems.

Abstract: Spoken conversational systems require more than accurate speech generation to have human-like conversations: to feel natural and engaging, they must produce conversational behaviour that adapts dynamically to the context. Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation. We propose a single-stage training protocol and systematically analyze design choices. Both the model and training code will be released to enable reproducible research on controllable full-duplex speech systems.

*Sama Hadhoud,Alaa Elsetohy,Frederikus Hudi,Jan Christian Blaise Cruz,Steven Halim,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes using natural-language editorials to improve LLM performance in competitive programming by focusing on problem-solving over implementation, revealing notable gaps in reasoning despite improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations in competitive programming do not distinguish between reasoning (problem-solving) and code implementation, limiting the understanding of LLM capabilities and challenges.

Method: They evaluated LLMs using a dataset of 83 ICPC-style problems with expert-written (gold) and model-generated editorials. They diagnosed reasoning errors and used an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation.

Result: Generating editorials improves model performance, especially when using gold (expert) editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models struggle with implementation and gap in generated vs. gold editorials remains a key bottleneck.

Conclusion: Future benchmarks should separate problem-solving from implementation, while improving LLMs’ reasoning abilities through innovative evaluation and training approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly succeed on competitive programming problems, yet existing evaluations conflate algorithmic reasoning with code-level implementation. We argue that competitive programming is fundamentally a problem-solving task and propose centering natural-language editorials in both solution generation and evaluation. Generating an editorial prior to code improves solve rates for some LLMs, with substantially larger gains when using expertly written gold editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation. We introduce a dataset of 83 ICPC-style problems with gold editorials and full test suites, and evaluate 19 LLMs, arguing that future benchmarks should explicitly separate problem solving from implementation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Chain-of-Thought Search (NCoTS) to guide Large Language Models towards more optimal reasoning paths, improving both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models generate reasoning sequentially without foresight, often leading to redundant or suboptimal reasoning paths.

Method: NCoTS reforms reasoning into a dynamic search process using a dual-factor heuristic that balances correctness and computational cost to identify sparse superior paths in the solution space.

Result: NCoTS boosts accuracy by over 3.5% and reduces generation length by more than 22% on diverse reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively refines reasoning in Large Language Models, showcasing enhanced accuracy and reduced redundancy through dynamic path navigation.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has significantly enhanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models. Unfortunately, current models generate reasoning steps sequentially without foresight, often becoming trapped in suboptimal reasoning paths with redundant steps. In contrast, we introduce Neural Chain-of-Thought Search (NCoTS), a framework that reformulates reasoning as a dynamic search for the optimal thinking strategy. By quantitatively characterizing the solution space, we reveal the existence of sparse superior reasoning paths that are simultaneously more accurate and concise than standard outputs. Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that optimizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of large language models (LLMs) for drafting patient portal responses, proposing methods to align them with individual clinicians. Despite some success, challenges persist in achieving reliable and clinician-aligned outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time and effort challenges clinicians face with patient portal communication by evaluating LLM capabilities in drafting responses aligned with individual clinicians.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses, released an expert-annotated dataset, and evaluated local and commercial LLMs using methods such as retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning, and preference optimization.

Result: LLMs can draft certain thematic elements effectively but struggle in tasks like eliciting further patient information. Theme-driven adaptation strategies improve alignment but uncertainty remains.

Conclusion: Adapting LLMs to individual clinician preferences is essential for reliable and responsible integration into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in drafting responses to patient portal messages, yet their integration into clinical workflows raises various concerns, including whether they would actually save clinicians time and effort in their portal workload. We investigate LLM alignment with individual clinicians through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient message response drafting task. We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients. Theme-driven adaptation strategies yield improvements across most themes. Our findings underscore the necessity of adapting LLMs to individual clinician preferences to enable reliable and responsible use in patient-clinician communication workflows.

### [66] [Reward Modeling for Scientific Writing Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11374)
*Furkan Şahinuç,Subhabrata Dutta,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in evaluating scientific writing tasks and proposes cost-efficient reward models tailored for this purpose using a new two-stage training framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific writing evaluation requires domain knowledge and task-specific reasoning capabilities, which are lacking in current general-purpose LLM-based models.

Method: A two-stage training framework is introduced: optimizing scientific evaluation preferences first, followed by refining reasoning capabilities. Multi-aspect evaluation and joint training across tasks enhance performance.

Result: Experimental results show improved scientific writing evaluation using the proposed models, with effective generalization across diverse tasks and unseen settings.

Conclusion: The proposed models provide a reliable and reusable evaluation method for scientific writing tasks without task-specific retraining, addressing practical and resource-cost concerns.

Abstract: Scientific writing is an expert-domain task that demands deep domain knowledge, task-specific requirements and reasoning capabilities that leverage the domain knowledge to satisfy the task specifications. While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities. Our multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks enable fine-grained assessment and robustness to dynamic criteria and scoring rubrics. Experimental analysis shows that our training regime strongly improves LLM-based scientific writing evaluation. Our models generalize effectively across tasks and to previously unseen scientific writing evaluation settings, allowing a single trained evaluator to be reused without task-specific retraining.

*Morgane Hoffmann,Emma Jouffroy,Warren Jouanneau,Marc Palyart,Charles Pebereau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how Large Language Models (LLMs) make decisions about recruitment by analyzing their logic in weighing candidate attributes, identifying biases, and comparing them to human decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recruitment involves complex decisions requiring reasoning over unstructured text, weighing diverse criteria, and inferring competencies. The study aims to understand if LLMs align with human, economic, or societal expectations in attribute evaluation.

Method: The researchers used synthetic datasets created from real freelancer profiles and projects on a European freelance platform. They employed factorial design to assess how LLMs prioritize match-relevant factors in different contexts and among demographics.

Result: The LLM prioritized core productivity indicators like skills and experience but also interpreted certain features non-explicitly. Minimal average bias against minority groups was found, yet intersectional effects showed differing attribute weights among demographic groups.

Conclusion: The paper highlights how LLMs evaluate candidates for recruitment, responsibly addressing societal fairness. It also proposes methods to compare LLM decision-making logic to human recruiters for better alignment.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in recruitment applications, where decisions require reasoning over unstructured text, balancing multiple criteria, and inferring fit and competence from indirect productivity signals. Yet, it is still uncertain how LLMs assign importance to each attribute and whether such assignments are in line with economic principles, recruiter preferences or broader societal norms. We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM's decision logic in recruitment, by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit. We identify which attributes the LLM prioritizes and analyze how these weights vary across project contexts and demographic subgroups. Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions. Our findings reveal that the LLM weighs core productivity signals, such as skills and experience, but interprets certain features beyond their explicit matching value. While showing minimal average discrimination against minority groups, intersectional effects reveal that productivity signals carry different weights between demographic groups.

### [68] [Relational Linearity is a Predictor of Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11429)
*Yuetian Lu,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates hallucinations in medium-size large language models (LLMs), revealing a correlation between relational linearity and hallucination rates, using a synthetic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs impact their reliability, particularly when responding to queries about synthetic or unknown entities. Understanding why this happens is crucial for enhancing LLM performance.

Method: They propose the hypothesis that linear relations are contributing factors to LLM hallucination, creating a synthetic dataset called SyntHal with thousands of entities across different relations and testing four models.

Result: A strong correlation (r ∈ [0.78, 0.82]) is found between the linearity of relational data storage and hallucination rates, supporting their hypothesis.

Conclusion: Structuring relational data more appropriately could help reduce hallucinations in LLMs, opening up avenues for improving the representation of factual knowledge.

Abstract: Hallucination is a central failure mode in large language models (LLMs). We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: "Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.

### [69] [The unreasonable effectiveness of pattern matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11432)
*Gary Lupyan,Blaise Agüera y Arcas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights how large language models can understand meaning in nonsensical language, exploring their pattern-matching capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models comprehend meaning or merely mimic language patterns and analyze their cognitive processes.

Method: The researchers replaced content words in sentences with nonsense strings and assessed LLMs' ability to interpret and translate these sentences.

Result: LLMs demonstrated a remarkable capacity to derive meaningful translations from nonsensical inputs by leveraging structural patterns.

Conclusion: Pattern-matching in LLMs is not separate from intelligence but is a critical component of their effectiveness in processing and interpreting language.

Abstract: We report on an astonishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to make sense of "Jabberwocky" language in which most or all content words have been randomly replaced by nonsense strings, e.g., translating "He dwushed a ghanc zawk" to "He dragged a spare chair". This result addresses ongoing controversies regarding how to best think of what LLMs are doing: are they a language mimic, a database, a blurry version of the Web? The ability of LLMs to recover meaning from structural patterns speaks to the unreasonable effectiveness of pattern-matching. Pattern-matching is not an alternative to "real" intelligence, but rather a key ingredient.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HORSE, a novel model editing method for LLMs that focuses on hierarchical orthogonal residual spreading for effective and stable editing without noisy gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns in large language models and improve editing methods while reducing computational cost and avoiding conflicts.

Method: The authors propose HORSE, a hierarchical approach emphasizing orthogonal residual spread in the information matrix to stabilize edits and reduce noisy gradients.

Result: HORSE demonstrates superior editing precision, stability, and effectiveness compared to other methods, tested across datasets and multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: HORSE offers a computationally efficient, conflict-free solution for safe and stable model editing in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various domains, yet they face critical safety concerns. Model editing has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. Existing model editing methods often focus on optimizing an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. While effective, these approaches can be computationally expensive and may cause conflicts. In contrast, we shift our attention to Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual SprEad of the information matrix, which reduces noisy gradients and enables more stable edits from a different perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method HORSE through a clear theoretical comparison with several popular methods and extensive experiments conducted on two datasets across multiple LLMs. The results show that HORSE maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of suboptimal generalization performance of RAG systems due to distribution shifts in specialized domains.

Method: Introduces TTARAG, a test-time adaptation approach that updates language model parameters during inference by predicting retrieved content for seamless domain adaptation.

Result: TTARAG outperforms baseline RAG methods across six specialized domains as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: TTARAG's dynamic parameter updating significantly enhances RAG's domain-specific performance, offering a promising adaptation strategy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing large language models' question-answering capabilities through the integration of external knowledge. However, when adapting RAG systems to specialized domains, challenges arise from distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we propose TTARAG, a test-time adaptation method that dynamically updates the language model's parameters during inference to improve RAG system performance in specialized domains. Our method introduces a simple yet effective approach where the model learns to predict retrieved content, enabling automatic parameter adjustment to the target domain. Through extensive experiments across six specialized domains, we demonstrate that TTARAG achieves substantial performance improvements over baseline RAG systems.

### [72] [CTest-Metric: A Unified Framework to Assess Clinical Validity of Metrics for CT Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11488)
*Vanshali Sharma,Andrea Mia Bejar,Gorkem Durak,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a metric assessment framework, CTest-Metric, to evaluate clinical metrics for radiology report generation (RRG), with robustness across writing styles, error tolerance, and expert correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, radiology report generation lacks robust, domain-specific quality assessment methods, which impairs clinical applications. Developing reliable evaluation metrics is necessary.

Method: The framework includes three modules: (1) Writing Style Generalizability using rephrased reports, (2) Synthetic Error Injection to assess error tolerance, and (3) Metric-vs-Expert correlation using expert ratings on disagreement cases.

Result: Lexical metrics are sensitive to stylistic changes, GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), CRG correlates negatively, and BERTScore-F1 is least impacted by factual errors.

Conclusion: CTest-Metric provides a standardized framework to evaluate RRG metrics comprehensively. It aims to improve clinical usability and foster further research in the field.

Abstract: In the generative AI era, where even critical medical tasks are increasingly automated, radiology report generation (RRG) continues to rely on suboptimal metrics for quality assessment. Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 "disagreement" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.

*Koyena Pal,David Bau,Chandan Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether explanations generated by Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generalize across different models and evaluates their consistency and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to understand whether textual chains of thought (CoT) explanations produced by LRMs truly reflect general patterns of reasoning or are merely model-specific artifacts.

Method: The researchers evaluated generalizability by checking if explanations from one LRM induce similar behavior in other LRMs and investigated the correlation of this behavior with human rankings and reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: The study found that CoT explanations often generalize across models, improving consistency. The improvement is correlated with human preferences and reinforcement learning. A sentence-level ensembling strategy further enhanced consistency.

Conclusion: LRM-generated explanations can generalize but should be used cautiously when attempting new insights. The paper provides a framework to assess generalization and improve consistency of these explanations.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) produce a textual chain of thought (CoT) in the process of solving a problem, which serves as a potentially powerful tool to understand the problem by surfacing a human-readable, natural-language explanation. However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency. Taken together, these results prescribe caution when using LRM explanations to yield new insights and outline a framework for characterizing LRM explanation generalization.

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of tokenization variations in language models, challenging simplistic views on token lengths and aiming to improve understanding of tokenization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify variations in tokenization across language models and textual domains, addressing inconsistencies in token counts used for model comparisons and inference pricing.

Method: Empirical analysis was conducted on tokenization processes, analyzing how sequences are compressed to tokens across diverse text distributions.

Result: The study reveals significant variations in tokenization and challenges common heuristics about token lengths, providing deeper insight into the dynamics of tokens in machine learning models.

Conclusion: The findings enhance clarity and intuition regarding tokenization practices, encouraging a more nuanced approach to evaluating and comparing tokens in language models.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs.

Motivation: To address the challenge of forecasting spatially dense motion representations from noisy real-world data, and explore scalable learning methods for future motion prediction.

Method: FOFPred uses a unified Vision-Language Model and Diffusion architecture trained on web-scale human activity data with extensive preprocessing and strong image pretraining.

Result: The trained model demonstrates cross-domain versatility by excelling in robotic manipulation and video generation tasks under language-driven settings.

Conclusion: A unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable data learning can effectively predict optical flow and enable advancements in control and generative tasks across domains.

Abstract: Future motion representations, such as optical flow, offer immense value for control and generative tasks. However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations caused by the lack of high-quality datasets for OOD detection, particularly ones that have clearly defined OOD categories and support diverse computer vision tasks.

Method: The study involves creating the ICONIC-444 dataset using an industrial sorting machine to capture varied and structured visual data for both fine/coarse-grained OOD evaluation and benchmarking state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Result: ICONIC-444 successfully provides a large and versatile dataset tailored for OOD detection with baseline results of 22 post-hoc detection methods.

Conclusion: ICONIC-444 is a significant contribution to OOD detection research, enabling systematic evaluations across task complexities and advancing capabilities in detecting near- to far-OOD categories.

Abstract: Current progress in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is limited by the lack of large, high-quality datasets with clearly defined OOD categories across varying difficulty levels (near- to far-OOD) that support both fine- and coarse-grained computer vision tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce ICONIC-444 (Image Classification and OOD Detection with Numerous Intricate Complexities), a specialized large-scale industrial image dataset containing over 3.1 million RGB images spanning 444 classes tailored for OOD detection research. Captured with a prototype industrial sorting machine, ICONIC-444 closely mimics real-world tasks. It complements existing datasets by offering structured, diverse data suited for rigorous OOD evaluation across a spectrum of task complexities. We define four reference tasks within ICONIC-444 to benchmark and advance OOD detection research and provide baseline results for 22 state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods.

Motivation: To improve 3D object perception and tracking across static camera networks in industrial settings, addressing issues like heterogeneous sensors and extreme occlusion.

Method: The proposed system uses geometric priors, an occlusion-aware ReID embedding module, generative data augmentation via NVIDIA COSMOS, and hardware optimization with TensorRT for real-time deployment.

Result: Achieved a state-of-the-art HOTA of 45.22 on AI City Challenge 2025 and a significant speedup allowing processing of 64 concurrent streams on a single GPU.

Conclusion: The adapted Sparse4D framework effectively handles industrial-scale tracking challenges and enables efficient, real-time deployment using optimized hardware tools.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object perception and multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking are fundamental for the digital transformation of industrial infrastructure. However, transitioning "inside-out" autonomous driving models to "outside-in" static camera networks presents significant challenges due to heterogeneous camera placements and extreme occlusion. In this paper, we present an adapted Sparse4D framework specifically optimized for large-scale infrastructure environments. Our system leverages absolute world-coordinate geometric priors and introduces an occlusion-aware ReID embedding module to maintain identity stability across distributed sensor networks. To bridge the Sim2Real domain gap without manual labeling, we employ a generative data augmentation strategy using the NVIDIA COSMOS framework, creating diverse environmental styles that enhance the model's appearance-invariance. Evaluated on the AI City Challenge 2025 benchmark, our camera-only framework achieves a state-of-the-art HOTA of $45.22$. Furthermore, we address real-time deployment constraints by developing an optimized TensorRT plugin for Multi-Scale Deformable Aggregation (MSDA). Our hardware-accelerated implementation achieves a $2.15\times$ speedup on modern GPU architectures, enabling a single Blackwell-class GPU to support over 64 concurrent camera streams.

Result: GPT-4o achieved the highest scores (F1-score 0.756 and accuracy 0.799 for actions; F1-score 0.712 and accuracy 0.773 for emotions), outperforming Florence 2 and LLaVa-1.5.

Conclusion: General-purpose VLMs provide baseline capabilities for human behavior recognition in construction, but enhancements like domain adaptation and multimodal sensing are necessary for practical application.

Abstract: As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.

### [79] [One Model, Many Behaviors: Training-Induced Effects on Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10836)
*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between training strategies aimed at improving in-distribution accuracy and their impact on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the unexplored interplay between modern training pipelines, which aim to maximize in-distribution accuracy, and their impact on OOD detection performance.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study by benchmarking 21 state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained ResNet-50 models using diverse training strategies and evaluating them on eight OOD test sets.

Result: It reveals a non-monotonic relationship between ID accuracy and OOD detection performance, with OOD performance deteriorating after surpassing baseline accuracy. It also identifies interdependencies between training strategies, detector choice, and OOD performance.

Conclusion: No single OOD detection method is universally optimal, and OOD detection performance is strongly influenced by training strategies and detector choices.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust and reliable machine-learning systems in open-world settings. Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of reducing temporal data reliance while increasing resolution in 3D ResNet-based human action recognition models and evaluates performance using novel enhanced architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance human action recognition by exploring spatiotemporal feature extraction while altering temporal data reliance and improving frame resolution. This stems from the need to optimize performance in computer vision applications.

Method: The authors introduced dropout-enhanced models of MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D, alongside ten new variants with attention mechanisms like CBAM, TCN, multi-headed, and channel attention. Testing is conducted using the UCF101 dataset.

Result: The best accuracy, 88.98%, was achieved with the variant of R(2+1)D incorporating multi-headed attention. The modified models show varied performance impacts at the class level, with consistent overall accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of missing temporal features and suggest that increased resolution models with attention mechanisms can influence accuracy and overcome limited temporal data reliance.

Abstract: Human action recognition has become an important research focus in computer vision due to the wide range of applications where it is used. 3D Resnet-based CNN models, particularly MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D, have different convolutional filters to extract spatiotemporal features. This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D. This paper concludes the significance of missing temporal features in the performance of the newly created increased resolution models. The variants had different behavior on class-level accuracy, despite the similarity of their enhancements to the overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical SAM3 is a fine-tuned version of SAM3 for universal medical image segmentation, offering improved performance on challenging medical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of SAM3 in medical imaging due to severe domain shifts, lack of privileged spatial prompts, and complex anatomical structures.

Method: Fully fine-tuned SAM3 on large-scale 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired masks and text prompts, spanning 10 imaging modalities.

Result: Demonstrated significant improvements in segmentation accuracy across various medical datasets and modalities, even in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Full model adaptation (beyond prompt engineering) is crucial for robust segmentation under domain shifts; Medical SAM3 is an effective universal segmentation model for medical imaging.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset for motion generation with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, enabling finer control over body part movements, alongside a novel diffusion-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human motion generation struggle with fine-grained control over individual body parts due to the lack of detailed part-level motion annotations.

Method: The authors introduce a novel dataset featuring asynchronous, semantically distinct part movements with high temporal resolution, and propose a diffusion-based motion generation model (FrankenMotion) guided by part-specific textual prompts.

Result: FrankenMotion outperforms existing baseline methods retrained for this dataset and can generate complex, unseen motions.

Conclusion: The study provides a dataset and model for motion generation with enhanced spatial and temporal control, advancing the field of text-to-motion synthesis.

Abstract: Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training. Our code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Self-Supervised Learning and Latent Diffusion Models to improve surface imaging accuracy for Breast-Conserving Surgery by generating synthetic training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the precision of intraoperative margin assessment in Breast-Conserving Surgery through high-quality imaging, while overcoming the lack of annotated data for deep learning model training.

Method: The method involves using a Self-Supervised Learning-guided Latent Diffusion Model to generate synthetic data guided by embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, followed by fine-tuning a Vision Transformer for classification.

Result: The proposed method achieved 96.47% accuracy and a lower FID score of 45.72, outperforming conventional class-conditioned approaches.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining real and synthetically generated data for enhancing imaging and classification tasks in medical applications.

Abstract: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue, which poses serious risks to individual and public safety during long and exhaustive drives.

Method: Using a live camera and OpenCV, real-time facial images are analyzed for signs of drowsiness (like insufficient eye opening and yawning), processed by DCNNs and pre-trained models to detect and alert for driver drowsiness.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated excellent performance on the NTHU-DDD dataset and Yawn-Eye-Dataset, achieving drowsiness detection accuracies of 99.6% and 97%, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed system is non-invasive, cost-effective, and offers a practical solution for enhancing road safety by detecting and alerting drowsy drivers in real-time.

Abstract: A long road trip is fun for drivers. However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness. Our proposed and implemented DCNNs embedded drowsiness detection model successfully react with NTHU-DDD dataset and Yawn-Eye-Dataset with drowsiness detection classification accuracy of 99.6% and 97% respectively.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates five architectures for tree canopy detection under extreme data scarcity, finding lightweight CNN-based methods like YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN outperform transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tree canopy detection using limited and imbalanced aerial imagery datasets, a scenario modeled by the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition.

Method: Five advanced architectures (YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2) were tested for canopy segmentation. The evaluation focused on their performance with extremely scarce data while analyzing training strategies, augmentations, and constraints.

Result: Pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, performed significantly better than Vision Transformer-based models like DINOv2 and Swin-UNet due to the latter's high data dependency, lack of inductive biases, and task-specific challenges.

Conclusion: Lightweight CNN architectures are proven to be more reliable for canopy detection in small-data scenarios. Transformer-based models struggle unless extensively pretrained or augmented, especially for segmentation tasks requiring strong inductive biases.

Abstract: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) mimicking real-world medical diagnostic dialogue, enhancing diagnostic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI diagnosis has mainly focused on image analysis, neglecting patient-reported symptoms, which impacts accuracy.

Method: A two-model system: DocVLM for iterative symptom queries and PatientVLM for symptom responses based on ground-truth diagnoses. Clinical validation was conducted for the synthetic symptoms generated.

Result: DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions enable fine-tuning DocVLM with multi-turn consultations, improving diagnostic performance significantly.

Conclusion: Incorporating realistic symptom elicitation into diagnostic AI models enhances their accuracy over models relying solely on images.

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

Conclusion: MMedExpert-R1 establishes a robust foundation for multimodal medical reasoning, with techniques addressing clinical reasoning diversity and multi-specialty alignment challenges.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing distractor removal methods which are restricted to specific types of distractors, enabling a unified approach for broader distractor removal in 3D scenes.

Method: The method combines implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, introducing LPIPS loss and MVCL for end-to-end optimization, and utilizes multi-view information of corrupted images.

Result: The method effectively removes diverse distractors from 3D scenes, achieving results comparable to SOTA desnow methods, validated by a new benchmark dataset with annotated labels for synthetic and real-world distractors.

Conclusion: IDDR-NGP is a robust, unified solution for 3D distractor removal, demonstrating efficiency and high-quality restoration of 3D scenes across diverse conditions and distractor types.

Abstract: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.

Conclusion: This benchmark offers a foundation for improving AI-generated video detection, enhancing dataset quality, and guiding future research in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

TL;DR: The paper addresses shortcomings in the M3DDM framework for video outpainting and proposes M3DDM+, which improves quality in challenging scenarios using a refined training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing M3DDM framework faces significant quality issues, such as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency, especially in difficult scenarios with limited inter-frame information.

Method: M3DDM+ incorporates a revised training strategy using uniform mask direction and width across frames and fine-tunes the pretrained M3DDM model to address training-inference mismatches.

Result: M3DDM+ delivers improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence in outpainting with minimal impact on computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed M3DDM+ framework significantly enhances video outpainting quality in challenging scenarios, making it both effective and computationally efficient.

Abstract: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-aware reinforcement learning approach to improve transformer-based video generation by enforcing rigid body collision rules, addressing a common oversight in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based video generation often overlooks physical principles such as rigid body motion, leading to unrealistic simulations compared to physics-based approaches.

Method: Developing a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm to enforce collision rules in high-dimensional spaces, and extending it to a fine-tuning framework named Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle).

Result: The proposed framework was validated through the creation of a benchmark (PhysRVGBench) and showed strong performance in experiments assessing its realism and physical accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-enforced reinforcement learning and MDcycle framework significantly enhance the physical realism of transformer-based video generation models.

Abstract: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDance introduces a new framework for character animation that addresses challenges in multi-subject rendering, spatial misalignment, and arbitrary subject types/counts, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing character animation techniques that fail to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse types, and spatial misalignment robustly.

Method: The Unbind-Rebind framework: Unbind removes rigid spatial binding through stochastic perturbations, while Rebind uses semantic and spatial guidance for precise motion control and subject association.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate CoDance achieves state-of-the-art performance on a newly proposed CoDanceBench and existing datasets.

Conclusion: CoDance effectively generalizes animation across diverse subjects and layouts, offering robust solutions for multi-subject rendering with plans for open-source release.

Abstract: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.

Result: Experimental results showed the proposed method performs effectively on real-world datasets across different point cloud learning tasks like classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the limitations of conventional graph structures, enhancing the analysis of 3D point clouds by introducing a robust graph smoothing and improved local geometry learning approach.

Abstract: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VIGA, a framework for achieving vision-as-inverse-graphics using iterative multimodal reasoning, robust to various tasks and model-agnostic, which significantly outperforms baselines in reconstructive and editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the challenge of reconstructing images into editable graphics programs, a long-standing goal in computer vision, by addressing the limitations of current vision-language models (VLMs) related to fine-grained spatial and physical reasoning in one-shot scenarios.

Method: The proposed VIGA framework employs an iterative write-run-render-compare-revise process for scene reconstruction or editing. It integrates a skill library for generator and verifier roles alongside an evolving context memory containing plans, code changes, and render history to support long-horizon reasoning.

Result: VIGA notably enhances one-shot performance on BlenderGym (35.32%), SlideBench (117.17%), and BlenderBench by 124.70%, demonstrating significant improvement over existing baselines in various tasks.

Conclusion: VIGA offers a task-agnostic and model-agnostic approach for vision-as-inverse-graphics, setting a unified evaluation protocol for foundational vision-language models while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SoLA-Vision, a hybrid attention model combining linear and softmax attention for efficient and accurate visual representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and modeling accuracy in self-attention mechanisms for high-resolution vision tasks.

Method: The authors analyze linear and softmax attention layer-wise, designing a fine-grained hybrid structure. They propose SoLA-Vision, which incorporates a small number of softmax layers strategically within a linear attention-based model.

Result: SoLA-Vision achieves strong accuracy and efficiency, surpassing linear, softmax, and other hybrid attention models on tasks like ImageNet-1K and dense prediction.

Conclusion: SoLA-Vision demonstrates a superior balance of performance and computational cost, offering a flexible framework for visual tasks. Its effectiveness is evident in benchmarks like ImageNet-1K and dense prediction performance.

Abstract: Standard softmax self-attention excels in vision tasks but incurs quadratic complexity O(N^2), limiting high-resolution deployment. Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin. Code will be released.

TL;DR: This study introduces Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), a highly compressed global Earth embedding database for 25 years (2000–2024), enabling efficient planetary-scale analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global-scale analysis of satellite-borne Earth Observation systems is limited by high computational/storage demands, hindering widespread research applications.

Method: The study employs ESDNet and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) to transform multi-sensor data into quantized latent vectors, achieving significant data compression while retaining essential features.

Result: The ESD database achieves a ~340-fold reduction in data volume, high reconstructive fidelity, and improved land-cover classification accuracy, enabling analysis on standard systems.

Conclusion: ESD democratizes planetary-scale research, providing a scalable and versatile tool for geospatial AI and global environmental studies.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired aligned samples using Rectified Flow models, improving efficiency and quality for image, video, and 3D generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for paired sample generation do not adequately address structural alignment, and recent approaches like SDS are slow and prone to issues such as mode collapse and low-quality outputs.

Method: The proposed method uses joint transport in sample space and can be applied to Rectified Flow models over structured latent spaces for faster and more aligned generation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results for image and video generation and comparable 3D results at significantly higher speeds.

Conclusion: The method enhances structural alignment and visual quality while improving computational efficiency compared to prior methods.

Abstract: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address person re-identification across diverse scenarios like cross-resolution and clothing changes, unifying these tasks under a single framework.

Method: The method involves a three-stage framework, ITKM, utilizing pre-trained CLIP models with image-text knowledge modeling for fine-tuning image encoders, text embeddings, multi-scenario loss, and dynamic representation updates.

Result: Experimental results show ITKM's superiority in performance compared to scenario-specific methods and its ability to generalize across multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: ITKM enhances multi-scenario person re-identification by integrating knowledge from various scenarios, improving over existing methods' limitations.

Abstract: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address challenges in handwritten word retrieval due to variability in handwriting styles, semantic gaps across languages, and computational limitations of large models in edge applications.

Method: A lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder is designed to generate style-invariant visual embeddings by optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, ensuring cross-script and writing style invariance.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on within-language retrieval benchmarks and demonstrates effective cross-lingual retrieval using fewer parameters than existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is highly efficient and accurate, enabling resource-friendly and effective handwriting retrieval in multiple scripts and languages.

Abstract: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the FTDMamba network tailored for UAV video anomaly detection with dynamic backgrounds, addressing issues related to motion coupling and inter-frame continuity while introducing a new MUVAD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing video anomaly detection methods that struggle with dynamically captured UAV videos, where normal and anomalous motions are intricately interwoven and inter-frame dynamics are not jointly modeled.

Method: The paper proposes the FTDMamba network featuring: (1) Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module for disentangling coupled motions; (2) Temporal Dilation Mamba Module for refined temporal and spatial modeling across varying scales.

Result: FTDMamba delivers state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset, which includes diverse scenarios and anomalies in UAV videos.

Conclusion: FTDMamba effectively tackles challenges in UAV-based video anomaly detection with dynamic backgrounds while enhancing datasets to facilitate research and progress in this domain.

Abstract: Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the data-heavy requirements of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robotic learning and balance them with the efficiency of compact CNNs like ResNet.

Method: Cross-architecture knowledge distillation is performed, transferring visual representations from a frozen DINOv2 ViT to a ResNet-18 encoder, which is later fine-tuned with a diffusion policy for target manipulation tasks.

Result: X-Distill achieves superior performance in robotic tasks, surpassing from-scratch ResNet, fine-tuned DINOv2, 3D point cloud encoders, and larger Vision-Language Models in both simulation and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the efficacy of leveraging a simple knowledge distillation strategy to optimize robotic visuomotor policies for data-efficient manipulation.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), a novel adaptive video segmentation framework for UAVs aimed at accelerating inference while maintaining accuracy in disaster response scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the computational challenges posed by high-resolution oblique aerial video processing on UAVs, which are constrained by Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) restrictions, limiting real-time disaster response.

Method: TTR is a framework that reduces computational load by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancies in video streams, identifying static regions through lightweight similarity metrics, and reusing precomputed features to bypass redundant calculations.

Result: TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency on edge-grade hardware with minimal performance degradation (<0.5% mIoU), validated on benchmarks and a specialized oblique floodwater dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves the feasibility of high-fidelity, real-time aerial video analysis under SWaP constraints, benefiting critical disaster response missions.

Abstract: Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions

Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in video segmentation workflows, including manual labor, costs of commercial platforms, and privacy concerns tied to cloud-based tools.

Method: A modified SAM2 dependency enabling reduced computational overhead and improved throughput, alongside features such as instance identity management and auto-prompting mechanisms.

Result: SAMannot was validated via animal behavior tracking and benchmark datasets, demonstrating scalability, privacy, and cost efficiency.

Conclusion: SAMannot offers a viable local framework for high-fidelity video annotation tasks, making segmentation workflows more efficient, private, and accessible.

Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.

*Antoine Carreaud,Elias Naha,Arthur Chansel,Nina Lahellec,Jan Skaloud,Adrien Gressin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CASWiT, a dual-branch Transformer architecture for ultra high resolution (UHR) image segmentation in remote sensing, achieving superior results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of semantic segmentation in UHR images, particularly memory constraints faced by Transformer models due to quadratic complexity in token count.

Method: CASWiT employs a dual-branch Swin-based architecture with a context encoder for long-range dependencies and a high-resolution encoder for UHR features. A cross-scale fusion module combines these outputs, complemented by SimMIM-style pretraining with masked tokens for better feature extraction.

Result: CASWiT achieves 65.83% mIoU on the IGN FLAIR-HUB dataset, surpassing RGB baselines by 1.78%, and achieves 49.1% mIoU on the URUR dataset, exceeding previous state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: CASWiT effectively addresses the limitations of Transformer-based approaches for semantic segmentation, offering both detailed feature extraction and contextual integration, with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol. All codes are provided on: https://huggingface.co/collections/heig-vd-geo/caswit.

*Pavana Pradeep,Krishna Kant,Suya Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes combining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with traditional computer vision via logic reasoning to enhance situational awareness applications, focusing on fine-grained event detection, better accuracy, and output justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in identifying rare but important events with high precision and extracting fine-grained details essential for situational awareness applications.

Method: The authors propose integrating VLMs with traditional computer vision methods using explicit logic reasoning. They also introduce an intelligent fine-tuning strategy to improve accuracy and provide reasoning for model outputs.

Result: The intelligent fine-tuning strategy improves recognition accuracy significantly compared to uninformed approaches. It also offers a mechanism to confirm or question the validity of VLM outputs during inference.

Conclusion: Integrating VLMs with traditional computer vision and logic reasoning enhances situational awareness by improving event detection, accuracy, and output explainability. The proposed approach offers practical benefits for applications requiring high reliability.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.

### [109] [Beer-Lambert Autoencoder for Unsupervised Stain Representation Learning and Deconvolution in Multi-immunohistochemical Brightfield Histology Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11336)
*Mark Eastwood,Thomas McKee,Zedong Hu,Sabine Tejpar,Fayyaz Minhas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-driven encoder-decoder model for multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC), improving chromogenic stain separation and producing superior concentration maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and limitations of classical Beer-Lambert color deconvolution in multiplex IHC (mIHC) setups with more than three chromogens (K>3).

Method: A simple encoder-decoder architecture is developed. The encoder, a compact U-Net, predicts stain concentration channels, while the decoder uses a differentiable Beer-Lambert forward model with a learnable stain matrix. The model is trained unsupervised with reconstruction and anti-stain mixing loss functions.

Result: The method demonstrates excellent RGB image reconstruction and reduced inter-channel stain bleed-through in a colorectal mIHC panel with 5 stains, outperforming traditional matrix-based deconvolution.

Conclusion: This approach effectively separates chromogenic stains in mIHC WSI, providing a robust tool for stain quantification. The code and model are publicly available for further use.

Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution. Code and model are available at https://github.com/measty/StainQuant.git.

### [110] [Assessing Building Heat Resilience Using UAV and Street-View Imagery with Coupled Global Context Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11357)
*Steffen Knoblauch,Ram Kumar Muthusamy,Hao Li,Iddy Chazua,Benedcto Adamu,Innocent Maholi,Alexander Zipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning framework integrating UAV and street-view imagery to assess heat-related urban building attributes, aiding climate adaptation efforts in cities like Dar es Salaam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies heat exposure risks in urban areas, especially in the Global South, where scalable assessments of heat-relevant building attributes are lacking.

Method: The paper proposes a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT), integrating UAV and street-view imagery with thermal infrared data from HotSat-1 to analyze urban structures' heat-relevant attributes.

Result: The dual-modality learning outperformed single-modality approaches by up to 9.3%, identifying factors like vegetation, brighter roofing, and non-metal/tarpaulin roofing as significant in reducing heat exposure.

Conclusion: Data-driven machine learning approaches can identify socio-economic disparities in heat exposure, enabling equitable climate adaptation strategies in urban centers.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: The TCS framework improves multi-modal video understanding by using Multi-Query Reasoning and Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling strategies, enabling efficient and accurate analysis of long-form videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the limitations of MLLMs in understanding long-form videos, primarily due to computational constraints and ineffective frame selection.

Method: TCS comprises two components: Multi-Query Reasoning for generating comprehensive queries and Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling for balancing detailed local and global context information.

Result: Experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME show up to a 6.9% accuracy improvement and a 50% reduction in inference time while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: The TCS framework effectively enhances long video understanding in MLLMs by improving performance, computational efficiency, and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.

### [112] [Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided Composed Image Retrieval with Fine-Grained Probabilistic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11393)
*Haomiao Tang,Jinpeng Wang,Minyi Zhao,Guanghao Meng,Ruisheng Luo,Long Chen,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach, Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG), for enhancing Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) by addressing intrinsic uncertainties and noise through fine-grained probabilistic learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIR methods face challenges with intrinsic noise and uncertainty in query-target triplets as well as the lack of fine-grained modeling in existing probabilistic learning approaches.

Method: The HUG paradigm represents queries and targets with Gaussian embeddings for capturing uncertainties. HUG uses a provable dynamic weighting mechanism for query uncertainty and incorporates specific learning objectives that include holistically and fine-grained contrast learning with advanced sampling strategies.

Result: HUG demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods through benchmark experiments, showcasing its ability to improve retrieval accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: HUG effectively addresses CIR challenges with its innovative heterogeneous uncertainty-guided learning framework, offering a robust and discriminative approach to retrieval tasks by leveraging detailed uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

*Hanlin Wu,Pengfei Lin,Ehsan Javanmardi,Nanren Bao,Bo Qian,Hao Si,Manabu Tsukada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUG-Occ is a framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction offering high efficiency and accuracy through optimized sparse learning and enhanced geometry-semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of computational and memory overhead in 3D semantic occupancy prediction for real-time autonomous driving tasks.

Method: Introduced SUG-Occ, which leverages semantic and uncertainty priors, cascade sparse completion, and an OCR-based mask decoder to efficiently process 3D data.

Result: Achieved 7.34% improvement in accuracy and 57.8% efficiency gain on SemanticKITTI benchmark compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SUG-Occ effectively addresses the trade-off between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, making it suitable for real-time deployment.

Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.

*Shuai Yuan,Tianwu Lin,Shuang Chen,Yu Xia,Peng Qin,Xiangyu Liu,Xiaoqing Xu,Nan Xu,Hongsheng Zhang,Jie Wang,Peng Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WetSAM integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping with sparse point supervision, achieving superior performance in wetland segmentation while addressing temporal and spatial challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wetland mapping faces challenges due to expensive dense annotations and inadequate single-date imagery, compounded by wetland dynamics and existing models' poor performance under sparse labels.

Method: Introduce WetSAM, a dual-branch framework extending SAM for utilizing satellite time series. A temporally prompted branch incorporates hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to capture wetland specifics, while the spatial branch uses temporally constrained region-growing for dense pseudo-label generation, with bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizing both branches.

Result: WetSAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58% across eight global regions (~5,000 km2 each), highlighting its accuracy and scalability in wetland segmentation.

Conclusion: WetSAM demonstrates strong potential for scalable, low-cost, and high-resolution wetland mapping with sparse supervision, effectively addressing seasonal and inter-annual variability challenges.

Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SME-YOLO, an enhanced YOLOv11n model, for improved detection of tiny surface defects on PCBs and validates its high performance using experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve precision in detecting small, high-texture-similarity, and unevenly distributed defects in PCBs, which are critical to product reliability and safety.

Method: The approach includes three key innovations: 1) the use of Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss) to reduce IoU sensitivity for small objects, 2) replacing the standard upsampling process with the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB) to improve spatial resolution and preserve details, and 3) implementing a Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module for adaptive feature strengthening and efficient multi-scale fusion.

Result: SME-YOLO improves mAP by 2.2% and Precision by 4% over the baseline YOLOv11n, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the PKU-PCB dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed SME-YOLO model demonstrates effectiveness in addressing challenges of small target detection on PCBs and sets new performance benchmarks, proving its utility for practical defect detection applications.

Abstract: Surface defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) directly compromise product reliability and safety. However, achieving high-precision detection is challenging because PCB defects are typically characterized by tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on YOLOv11n, named SME-YOLO (Small-target Multi-scale Enhanced YOLO). First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects. Second, the original upsampling module is replaced by the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB). By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, SME-YOLO improves mAP by 2.2% and Precision by 4%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to incorporate width information into topological structures for image segmentation by enhancing traditional persistent homology methods using PDE concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mathematical definitions of topological structures lack dimensional width characteristics, limiting their effectiveness in practical image segmentation tasks requiring connectivity and structural fidelity.

Method: A novel framework combines persistent homology with PDE-based smoothing techniques to embed width information into topological structures, applied to variational models and neural networks for segmentation.

Result: The method effectively integrates topological properties and width features into image segmentation, preserving connectivity and genus while ensuring thickness and length attributes.

Conclusion: This approach improves topological fidelity in segmented images by explicitly embedding width characteristics, demonstrating practical advantages in complex segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.

Motivation: To enhance explainable spatial reasoning in 3D VLMs by enabling explicit and interpretable inference rooted in 3D structure.

Method: Introducing Metric-Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) for integrated spatial representation and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT) for deterministic geometric reasoning.

Result: Map2Thought achieves 59.9% accuracy with half the supervision, nearly matching the 60.9% baseline, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4–5.3% across various training subsets on VSI-Bench.

Conclusion: Map2Thought demonstrates the potential for explainable and effective 3D spatial reasoning, even with reduced data supervision.

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the human health, environmental risks, and vulnerabilities posed by large-scale livestock operations while meeting the need for accurate and scalable mapping as these operations grow.

Method: The method involves an infrastructure-first pipeline with a YOLOv8 detector for detecting infrastructure, extraction of descriptors, fusion with visual features using a spatial cross-attention classifier, and outputs that explain decisions based on visible structures.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements over baselines, and is validated through evaluations across various U.S. regions and quantitative analyses.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully combines domain knowledge and advanced visual-feature techniques to reliably and explainably detect and classify CAFOs.

Abstract: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (1) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria, (2) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier, and (3) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the memory and computational bottlenecks caused by the rapid growth of KV cache in increasingly complex vision-language models during inference.

Method: The proposed method includes modality-adaptive partial-RoPE and modality-decoupled low-rank approximation to compress visual and textual spaces independently, along with parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce adaptation costs.

Result: The experiments show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache usage, and works well with KV quantization.

Conclusion: MHA2MLA-VLM offers an effective solution for adapting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA architectures, achieving efficient inference and maintaining performance without costly pretraining.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

Conclusion: Generative, language-grounded reasoning offers a promising foundation for safer, interpretable, and effective autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.

*Emily Steiner,Jianhao Zheng,Henry Howard-Jenkins,Chris Xie,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReScene4D, a method for temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), addressing challenges in tracking and identifying changing object instances in evolving indoor environments using intermittently captured 3D scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in existing 3DSIS and 4D LiDAR methods for dealing with temporally sparse data and evolving indoor environments where objects move or change across intermittent observations.

Method: The proposed method, ReScene4D, adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4D SIS tasks without relying on dense observations. It uses strategies to share information across scans to ensure temporal instance consistency and improve standard segmentation quality.

Result: ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art results on the 3RScan dataset and demonstrates significant improvements in tracking temporal identity consistency. A new metric, t-mAP, is introduced to assess performance.

Conclusion: ReScene4D successfully handles temporally sparse 4DSIS tasks, setting a new benchmark for understanding dynamic indoor scenes and enabling better analysis of temporal identity changes in object instances.

Abstract: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeR introduces an innovative method for conditional 3D object shape generation in real-world scenarios using casually captured data, overcoming limitations of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in existing 3D shape generation methods that are limited by the reliance on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs, which are unrealistic in practical scenarios.

Method: ShapeR combines visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract rich object-specific data from image sequences. It uses a rectified flow transformer conditioned on various input modalities and employs techniques such as compositional augmentations, curriculum training, and clutter-handling strategies.

Result: ShapeR is evaluated against a newly introduced benchmark consisting of 178 real-world objects across 7 scenes, achieving a 2.7x improvement in Chamfer distance over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ShapeR demonstrates superior performance and robustness in generating high-fidelity 3D object shapes in complex, casually captured scenarios, marking significant progress over prior approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniX is a unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray tasks that decouples understanding and generation using distinct architectures, enhancing performance in both areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical foundation models face challenges in unifying visual understanding and image generation due to conflicting task goals, often resulting in subpar performance.

Method: UniX utilizes a decoupled dual-branch architecture: an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for generation. It incorporates cross-modal self-attention for task synergy, relies on a data cleaning pipeline, and adopts a multi-stage training strategy.

Result: UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in Micro-F1 score for understanding and a 24.2% improvement in generation quality while using significantly fewer parameters than comparable models.

Conclusion: UniX demonstrates that decoupled architectures can synergistically optimize both visual understanding and high-fidelity generation tasks, setting a scalable paradigm for medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

### [125] [AFLL: Real-time Load Stabilization for MMO Game Servers Based on Circular Causality Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10998)
*Shinsuk Kang,Youngjae Kim*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: AFLL is a real-time load stabilization system for MMO game servers that adaptively throttles low-priority messages while maintaining critical responses, significantly reducing CPU load and contention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MMO game servers face the challenge of handling thousands of simultaneous players while maintaining sub-100ms response times in overloaded conditions where traditional techniques fail to adapt dynamically.

Method: AFLL uses adaptive feedback loop learning paired with backpropagation to adjust message priorities dynamically, ensuring critical messages are prioritized and low-priority ones are preemptively blocked during potential overload situations.

Result: AFLL reduced average CPU time by 48.3%, peak CPU time by 51.7%, and thread contention by 64.4%, all while maintaining zero overhead learning and high reproducibility.

Conclusion: Adaptive causal learning from outgoing and incoming network messages offers a novel solution for real-time server load stabilization in latency-critical systems like MMO game servers.

Abstract: Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game servers must handle thousands of simultaneous players while maintaining sub-100ms response times. When server load exceeds capacity, traditional approaches either uniformly throttle all message types regardless of importance (damaging gameplay) or apply fixed heuristic rules that fail to adapt to dynamic workloads. This paper presents AFLL (Adaptive Feedback Loop Learning), a real-time load stabilization system that learns the causal relationship between outgoing server messages and subsequent incoming client requests. AFLL employs backpropagation to continuously adjust message type weights, enabling predictive throttling that blocks low-priority messages before overload occurs while guaranteeing critical message delivery. Through controlled experiments with 1,000 concurrent players, AFLL reduced average CPU time by 48.3% (13.2ms to 6.8ms), peak CPU time by 51.7% (54.0ms to 26.1ms), and thread contention by 64.4% (19.6% to 7.0%), while maintaining zero learning overhead through background computation and caching optimizations. The system achieved remarkable reproducibility (CV < 2% across all metrics) and identified a three-stage causal chain linking message blocking to load reduction. AFLL demonstrates that circular causality learning enables practical real-time adaptation for latency-critical systems.

*Niklas Kowallik,Trever Schirmer,David Bermbach*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper focuses on optimizing Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) deployments through function fusion and presents a system for analyzing all fusion configurations efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing FaaS deployments is complex due to immense fusion configuration possibilities and the costliness of benchmarking on live systems.

Method: The authors introduce a system that emulates the FaaS platform, enabling local experimentation to analyze fusion configurations without altering the live infrastructure.

Result: The study illustrates that only a limited subset of fusion configurations achieves optimal cost and latency trade-offs, highly influenced by the pricing model.

Conclusion: Local experimentation using the proposed system can effectively optimize FaaS applications by identifying efficient configurations, thus minimizing cost and time.

Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) has become a central paradigm in serverless cloud computing, yet optimizing FaaS deployments remains challenging. Using function fusion, multiple functions can be combined into a single deployment unit, which can be used to reduce cost and latency of complex serverless applications comprising multiple functions. Even in small-scale applications, the number of possible fusion configurations is vast, making brute-force benchmarking in production both cost- and time-prohibitive.
  In this paper, we present a system that can analyze every possible fusion setup of complex applications. By emulating the FaaS platform, our system enables local experimentation, eliminating the need to reconfigure the live platform and significantly reducing associated cost and time. We evaluate all fusion configurations across a number of example FaaS applications and resource limits. Our results reveal that, when analyzing cost and latency trade-offs, only a limited set of fusion configurations represent optimal solutions, which are strongly influenced by the specific pricing model in use.

*Paulo Sérgio Almeida*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel hybrid algorithm combining sender-buffering and receiver-buffering to achieve causal delivery of messages in distributed systems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing causal delivery approaches, particularly metadata overhead and sender-only buffering drawbacks, and develop a scalable and computationally efficient solution.

Method: The authors propose the Sender Permission to Send (SPS) enforcement strategy, combining sender-buffering for causality and receiver-buffering for FIFO order while optimizing metadata and computational processing.

Result: The algorithm achieves constant metadata size per message, computational optimality with constant processing overhead, and scalability while maintaining causal delivery.

Conclusion: This hybrid algorithm offers an innovative approach for topology-agnostic causal delivery with superior properties compared to existing methods, addressing metadata and scalability issues effectively.

Abstract: Message delivery respecting causal ordering (causal delivery) is one of the most classic and widely useful abstraction for inter-process communication in a distributed system. Most approaches tag messages with causality information and buffer them at the receiver until they can be safely delivered. Except for specific approaches that exploit communication topology, therefore not generally applicable, they incur a metadata overhead which is prohibitive for a large number of processes. Much less used are the approaches that enforce causal order by buffering messages at the sender, until it is safe to release them to the network, as the classic algorithm has too many drawbacks. In this paper, first we discuss the limitations of sender-only buffering approaches and introduce the Sender Permission to Send (SPS) enforcement strategy, showing that SPS + FIFO implies Causal. We analyze a recent sender-buffering algorithm, Cykas, which follows SPS + FIFO, albeit very conservatively, pointing out throughput scalability and liveness issues. Then, we introduce a novel SPS + FIFO based algorithm, which adopts a new hybrid approach: enforcing causality by combining sender-buffering to enforce SPS and receiver-buffering to enforce FIFO. The algorithm overcomes limitations of sender-only buffering, and achieves effectively constant metadata size per message. By a careful choice of data-structures, the algorithm is also computationally-optimal, with amortized effectively constant processing overhead. As far as we know, there is no other topology-agnostic causal delivery algorithm with these properties.

### [128] [Analytic Bijections for Smooth and Interpretable Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10774)
*Mathis Gerdes,Miranda C. N. Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces globally smooth and analytically invertible bijections for normalizing flows, addressing limitations of existing methods, and proposes a novel radial flow architecture for efficient and interpretable transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current normalizing flow methods face trade-offs in expressivity, smoothness, invertibility, and computational tractability of Jacobians.

Method: The authors propose three new bijection families (cubic rational, sinh, cubic polynomial), along with radial flow architecture that directly parameterizes transformations in radial coordinates.

Result: The proposed methods match or surpass spline performance, improve training stability, reduce parameters drastically, and perform well in high-dimensional physics applications like field theory.

Conclusion: The paper contributes expressive and practical scalar bijections, enhancing normalizing flows and expanding their applicability across domains.

Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ) framework for multi-source transfer learning aimed at preventing negative transfer by optimizing transfer weights and quantities together, and validates it experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of negative transfer in data-scarce settings, caused by naive uniform transfer from multiple sources, and to jointly optimize source weights and quantities, unlike existing approaches.

Method: The authors introduce UOWQ, a theoretical framework grounded in Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error analysis, which determines the best source weights and transfer quantities, offering closed-form solutions or numerical procedures.

Result: The framework provides optimal solutions for weights and transfer quantities, which are validated by extensive experiments on datasets like DomainNet and Office-Home, showing consistent performance improvement over strong baselines.

Conclusion: UOWQ proves that joint optimization of weights and quantities prevents negative transfer and enhances transfer learning outcomes, providing both theoretical and practical advancements in multi-source transfer learning.

Abstract: Transfer learning plays a vital role in improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios. However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.

We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates value level parallelism (VLP) to optimize nonlinear approximations and operations in transformer-based large language models (LLMs). It introduces the 'Mugi' architecture, providing substantial gains in throughput, efficiency, and environmental sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in efficiency and accuracy of computations within large language models, particularly beyond standard GEMM operations.

Method: Expand VLP to nonlinear approximations, optimize it for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs, and introduce a new architecture named 'Mugi' for supporting complete LLM workloads.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in throughput, energy efficiency, operational and embodied carbon reductions, with up to 668x improvement in energy efficiency for nonlinear operations.

Conclusion: Mugi and generalized VLP approaches can enhance LLM operations, making them more efficient, accurate, and environmentally sustainable.

Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.

*Mengmeng Peng,Zhenyu Fang,He Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of parameter entanglement in large language models and proposes a framework (RLCP) to separate reasoning and factual knowledge, enhancing computational efficiency while reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the problem of parameter entanglement in LLMs, which leads to inefficiency and hallucinations due to overlapping logic and facts within shared weights.

Method: The authors propose a thermodynamic model called 'digital metabolism' and introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), which uses deep-layer gradient reversal to isolate reasoning from factual associations.

Result: By applying RLCP to a model, the paper observes a phase transition where factual associations are almost entirely forgotten, resulting in emergent behaviors like chain-of-thought reasoning in tasks such as GSM8K.

Conclusion: The method presents a promising alternative to solving entanglement by enabling modular architectures that distinctly separate neural logic processing from symbolic memory storage, though further investigation is needed for causal mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) currently suffer from parameter entanglement, where general reasoning capabilities (logic) and specific factual knowledge (facts) exist in a superposition state within shared weights. This coupling leads to the "memory wall," where computational capacity is squandered on simulating retrieval, often resulting in hallucinations. In this paper, we propose "digital metabolism," a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent "structural crystallization" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the "metabolized" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning). While the causal mechanism underlying this behavioral shift requires further investigation, our findings provide a dynamic weight-level counterpart to architectural innovations like DeepSeek's Engram, paving the way for modular "Neural CPU + Symbolic RAM" architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a planner-guided multi-agent framework to enhance feature engineering code generation, addressing challenges like dataset scarcity, agent personalization, and ineffective human-AI collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address current barriers in the integration of code generation models in real-world ML teams, such as inadequate datasets, lack of integration with workflows, and inefficient collaboration between humans and AI.

Method: The proposed approach employs a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework. It orchestrates code generation using a graph-based environment representation, LLM-powered context-aware planning, and feedback-driven corrections, involving human intervention when necessary.

Result: Achieved 38% and 150% improvements over manual and unplanned workflows, respectively, and reduced feature engineering cycles from three weeks to a single day in production environments.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates significant practical implications, offering an efficient and reliable solution for production-level feature engineering, improving performance and collaborative processes in ML teams.

Abstract: Recent advances in code generation models have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for automating feature engineering, yet their adoption in real-world ML teams remains constrained by critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of datasets capturing the iterative and complex coding processes of production-level feature engineering, (ii) limited integration and personalization of widely used coding agents, such as CoPilot and Devin, with a team's unique tools, codebases, workflows, and practices, and (iii) suboptimal human-AI collaboration due to poorly timed or insufficient feedback. We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively. In practice, when building features for recommendation models serving over 120 million users, our approach has delivered real-world impact by reducing feature engineering cycles from three weeks to a single day.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-assisted approach to enhance human-in-the-loop topology optimization by predicting user-preferred regions, decreasing iterative trials and improving design outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topology Optimization (TO) is computationally intensive and restricts user interaction due to its black-box design. There is a need for approaches that incorporate human intuition without extensive manual iterations.

Method: A machine learning model based on a U-Net architecture was trained on synthetic datasets to predict regions of interest for design modifications in TO tasks. The model operated as an image segmentation tool, identifying user-preferred regions using predefined criteria.

Result: The AI co-pilot successfully predicted preferred regions for design modification, achieving generalization across varied TO problems and emergent behavior beyond training data. Demonstrations showed a 39% improvement in linear buckling load with minimal increase in design time.

Conclusion: The integration of an AI co-pilot into human-in-the-loop topology optimization enhances manufacturability and engineering performance while maintaining efficiency, paving the way for more intuitive and productive TO processes.

Abstract: Inverse design tools such as Topology Optimization (TO) can achieve new levels of improvement for high-performance engineered structures. However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Survival Learning with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) for credit risk prediction under strict data protection rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tightened regulatory constraints like GDPR and centralized training limitations hinder cross-institution credit risk model optimization.

Method: Federated Survival Learning framework integrates Bayesian Differential Privacy to model time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show Bayesian DP outperforms classical DP in federated architectures, achieving similar performance to non-private models.

Conclusion: Selecting privacy mechanisms must align with deployment architectures, especially in multi-institutional environments, to preserve performance and maintain privacy compliance.

Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.

### [136] [Beyond Accuracy: A Stability-Aware Metric for Multi-Horizon Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10863)
*Chutian Ma,Grigorii Pomazkin,Giacinto Paolo Saggese,Paul Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the forecast accuracy and coherence score (AC score) to evaluate and improve both prediction accuracy and consistency in time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods prioritize accuracy alone, often neglecting temporal consistency in forecasts.

Method: The paper proposes the AC score, a new metric for evaluating both multi-horizon accuracy and consistency, and applies it as an objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models.

Result: Using the AC score on the M4 Hourly dataset leads to a 75% reduction in forecast volatility while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: The AC score provides a balanced approach that enhances forecast stability without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.

*Jeffrey Uhlmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimization trajectory inconsistencies in positively homogeneous networks due to gauge symmetry, proposing a novel operator-level solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve issues in optimization caused by gauge symmetry in networks constructed with linear maps and positively homogeneous nonlinearities.

Method: Development of the Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint to achieve backward adjoint and optimization geometry consistent with gauge symmetry.

Result: The UC adjoint method maintains invariance in optimization geometry and is universally applicable across network components and optimizers.

Conclusion: UC gauge-consistent steepest descent and backpropagation rectify symmetry issues in network optimization, providing a unified operator-level approach.

Abstract: Deep neural networks constructed from linear maps and positively homogeneous nonlinearities (e.g., ReLU) possess a fundamental gauge symmetry: the network function is invariant to node-wise diagonal rescalings. However, standard gradient descent is not equivariant to this symmetry, causing optimization trajectories to depend heavily on arbitrary parameterizations. Prior work has proposed rescaling-invariant optimization schemes for positively homogeneous networks (e.g., path-based or path-space updates). Our contribution is complementary: we formulate the invariance requirement at the level of the backward adjoint/optimization geometry, which provides a simple, operator-level recipe that can be applied uniformly across network components and optimizer state. By replacing the Euclidean transpose with a Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint, we derive UC gauge-consistent steepest descent and backprogation.

### [138] [When Are Two Scores Better Than One? Investigating Ensembles of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11444)
*Raphaël Razafindralambo,Rémy Sun,Frédéric Precioso,Damien Garreau,Pierre-Alexandre Mattei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores ensembling for unconditional score-based diffusion models. Despite improving score-matching loss and model likelihood, perceptual quality metrics like FID do not consistently improve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of exploration into ensembling in unconditional score-based diffusion models, despite its known success in supervised models.

Method: Evaluates ensembling strategies like Deep Ensembles and Monte Carlo Dropout on CIFAR-10, FFHQ, and random forest models for tabular data, analyzing perceptual quality, model likelihood, and score-matching loss.

Result: Ensembling improves score-matching loss and model likelihood but inconsistently enhances perceptual quality metrics (e.g., FID). Tabular data shows one strategy outperforms others, and theoretical insights into score model summation are provided.

Conclusion: While ensembling shows benefits in some aspects, it does not ensure improvements in perceptual quality, warranting further investigation into its effects and applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).

*Rajat Ghosh,Debojyoti Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new metric 'Action Shapley' is proposed to improve the selection of training data for offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems and its computation is optimized with a novel algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of costly, impractical, or dangerous real-world interactions by improving the selection of training data for world models used in reinforcement learning.

Method: Introduced 'Action Shapley,' an agnostic metric, and developed a randomized dynamic algorithm to efficiently compute this metric, reducing the exponential complexity of traditional methods.

Result: Achieved over 80% improvement in computational efficiency and demonstrated superior performance of Action Shapley-based training data selection across five real-world case studies.

Conclusion: Action Shapley offers a robust and computationally efficient framework for unbiased training data selection, outperforming conventional ad-hoc methods.

Abstract: Numerous offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems incorporate world models to emulate the inherent environments. A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.

### [140] [Realistic Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous and Sustainable Marine Vessel Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10911)
*Zhang Xiaocai,Xiao Zhe,Liang Maohan,Liu Tao,Li Haijiang,Zhang Wenbin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework for sustainable vessel navigation with features like emission awareness, safety optimization, and robust learning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for sustainable maritime transport addressing environmental concerns like greenhouse gas emissions and navigational safety while overcoming the challenges of traditional reliance on human experience.

Method: The CRL framework combines a data-driven marine simulation, fuel prediction with machine learning, dynamic maritime conditions using a Diffusion Model, and image-based inputs to simulate spatial complexity. It employs a lightweight, policy-based agent and a reward mechanism considering safety, emissions, timeliness, and task success.

Result: The framework is validated in a realistic simulation for the Indian Ocean, showing successful sustainable navigation and safety improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed CRL framework demonstrates the potential for modernizing maritime navigation by integrating autonomy, safety, and emission-focused design in a systematic and robust approach.

Abstract: Sustainability is becoming increasingly critical in the maritime transport, encompassing both environmental and social impacts, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and navigational safety. Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces. We validate the proposed approach in a sea area of the Indian Ocean, demonstrating its efficacy in enabling sustainable and safe vessel navigation.

### [141] [FAConvLSTM: Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM for Efficient Feature Extraction in Multivariate Climate Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10914)
*Francis Ndikum Nji,Jianwu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces FAConvLSTM, a computationally efficient and spatially expressive alternative to ConvLSTM2D, aimed at improving spatiotemporal modeling of Earth observation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution Earth observation data's complexity, involving dynamics like teleconnections and nonstationarity, poses challenges for learning interpretable and less computationally intensive models.

Method: The paper proposes FAConvLSTM, which uses factorized-attention mechanisms, lightweight bottlenecks, multi-scale depthwise branches, and spatial attention to address the limitations of ConvLSTM2D.

Result: FAConvLSTM achieves stable, interpretable, and robust representations with reduced computational costs, outperforming ConvLSTM2D in experiments with climate data.

Conclusion: FAConvLSTM provides an effective solution for spatiotemporal modeling, enhancing efficiency, spatial representations, and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

### [142] [HOSL: Hybrid-Order Split Learning for Memory-Constrained Edge Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10940)
*Aakriti,Zhe Li,Dandan Liang,Chao Huang,Rui Li,Haibo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called HOSL that combines zeroth-order (ZO) and first-order (FO) optimization to reduce memory usage for split learning on edge devices while maintaining fast convergence and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing split learning systems rely on FO optimization, causing high memory overhead for edge devices. While ZO optimization reduces memory usage, it suffers from slow convergence and performance degradation. The motivation is to address this trade-off and enable efficient split learning between edge devices and servers.

Method: HOSL integrates ZO optimization on the memory-constrained client side and FO optimization on the compute-capable server side. This hybrid strategy eliminates backpropagation and activation storage on the client, reducing memory usage while maintaining fast convergence.

Result: HOSL achieves a theoretical convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$, which is dependent on the client-side model dimension rather than the full model dimension. Experiments with large language models (LLMs) show a 3.7× reduction in client memory use compared to FO methods, while maintaining accuracy within 0.20%-4.23%. It also outperforms ZO methods by up to 15.55%.

Conclusion: HOSL effectively combines the strengths of ZO and FO optimizations, demonstrating a memory-efficient and high-performing solution for split learning on resource-limited edge devices.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.

### [143] [Multivariate LSTM-Based Forecasting for Renewable Energy: Enhancing Climate Change Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10961)
*Farshid Kamrani,Kristen Schell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for accurate forecasting of renewable energy sources (RESs) generation, improving power system reliability and reducing emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for reliable and accurate forecasting of renewable energy sources (RESs) generation, given their inherent variability, to enhance power system operations' reliability, stability, and cost efficiency.

Method: The authors present a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network that uses real-world historical data from both local and neighboring regions to capture long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs.

Result: The introduced forecasting model demonstrates better accuracy in predicting RES generation, resulting in reduced CO2 emissions and a more dependable electricity supply, as shown in the case study.

Conclusion: The LSTM-based model offers an advanced method to enhance the prediction capabilities for RESs, addressing challenges of variability and boosting the overall efficiency and reliability of renewable energy integration into power systems.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into modern power systems presents significant opportunities but also notable challenges, primarily due to the inherent variability of RES generation. Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic methods and stochastic programming, frequently depend on representative scenarios generated through clustering techniques like K-means. However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy. In the case study, we showed that the proposed forecasting approach results in lower CO2 emissions, and a more reliable supply of electric loads.

### [144] [Transient learning dynamics drive escape from sharp valleys in Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10962)
*Ning Yang,Yikuan Zhang,Qi Ouyang,Chao Tang,Yuhai Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores why stochastic gradient descent (SGD) tends to favor flatter solutions that generalize better. The study reveals that SGD noise creates an effective potential reshaping the loss landscape, leading to such solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the unclear reasoning behind SGD's bias for flatter solutions with better generalizability in deep learning.

Method: The authors analyze SGD's learning dynamics using numerical experiments and a tractable physical model, showing how SGD noise reshapes the landscape and impacts solution selection.

Result: They find that SGD trajectories escape sharp valleys and favor flatter loss landscape regions due to noise-induced reshaping, with transient freezing mechanisms driving dynamics into flatter minima.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified framework tying SGD dynamics to loss-landscape geometry and generalization, offering insights for designing optimized algorithms.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is central to deep learning, yet the dynamical origin of its preference for flatter, more generalizable solutions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.

*Zain ul Abdeen,Waris Gill,Ming Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a meta-guided gradient-free reinforcement learning (MGF-RL) framework for resilient, efficient restoration of power distribution grids after extreme events, overcoming uncertainties in renewable energy, outage configurations, and grid dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in power grid restoration, including renewable energy uncertainty, scarcity of dispatchable resources, and nonlinear system behavior, and the limitations of standard reinforcement learning in adapting to unseen scenarios.

Method: The authors propose MGF-RL, combining first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies. This approach enables scalable policy search while bypassing gradient computation and allows for rapid adaptation to new outage scenarios with minimal tuning.

Result: MGF-RL demonstrates superior performance over standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control, excelling in reliability, restoration speed, and adaptability in simulated IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus systems.

Conclusion: MGF-RL is a promising solution for real-time, resilient load restoration in renewable-powered grids, offering improved generalization, efficient fine-tuning, and effective handling of uncertainty compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.

*Aanand Balasubramanian,Sashank Silwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a symbolic reasoning supervision method to enhance fix-type classification in compact automated program repair models, demonstrating improved performance without adding complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small code models for automated program repair are resource-efficient but often rely on shallow correlations, lacking meaningful structural understanding.

Method: A reasoning distillation approach was used, where a large teacher model provided structured symbolic reasoning tags and fix-type labels to train a lightweight student's CodeT5-based model.

Result: Reasoning supervision improved macro-averaged performance, especially on rare bug categories, and demonstrated that accurate reasoning traces correlated with correct predictions.

Conclusion: Symbolic reasoning distillation enhances interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models, offering a practical enhancement method without extra complexity.

Abstract: We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

### [147] [Constant Metric Scaling in Riemannian Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10992)
*Kisung You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper clarifies the distinction between effects caused by constant metric scaling on Riemannian manifolds and it separates quantities affected from invariant geometric objects, aiming to avoid confusion in computational practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a widespread but ambiguous use of constant metric scaling in computational contexts where its consequences can be misunderstood or misinterpreted as changes in geometric or structural properties.

Method: The paper provides a theoretical and expository account of constant metric scaling effects. It categorizes and distinguishes its impacts, analyzes quantities impacted, and explains invariance among geometric objects.

Result: The study identifies which elements such as norms, distances, and gradients change under scaling while clarifying key invariants like connections, geodesics, and maps. This guides practitioners on interpreting scaling effects without misrepresentation.

Conclusion: Constant metric scaling in Riemannian manifolds modifies computational attributes but preserves fundamental geometric structures. The analysis underscores its use as a tool for computational adjustments rather than geometry alteration.

Abstract: Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.

Result: The review highlights specific vulnerabilities unique to contrastive learning, summarizes recent advancements, and provides insights into challenges and future research areas.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for robust defenses against backdoor attacks in contrastive learning for secure and reliable deployment in industrial and distributed settings.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a leading self- supervised approach to representation learning across domains, including vision, multimodal settings, graphs, and federated learning. However, recent studies have shown that contrastive learning is susceptible to backdoor and data poisoning attacks. In these attacks, adversaries can manipulate pretraining data or model updates to insert hidden malicious behavior. This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions. Our findings have significant implications for the secure deployment of systems in industrial and distributed environments.

### [149] [Combating Spurious Correlations in Graph Interpretability via Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11021)
*Kecheng Cai,Chenyang Xu,Chao Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-reflection framework to enhance interpretability in graph learning, particularly for the challenging Spurious-Motif benchmark dataset with spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing graph learning methods fail to perform well in challenging datasets like Spurious-Motif, due to spurious correlations hindering interpretability.

Method: The authors employed a self-reflection framework, inspired by large language models, which integrates feedback-based reevaluation into graph learning methods to refine node and edge importance scores.

Result: The self-reflection framework significantly improves interpretability on spurious correlation-heavy datasets, showing superior performance compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Adapting self-reflection techniques from language models to graph learning tasks enhances interpretability and provides a promising approach for tackling spurious correlations in synthetic benchmarks.

Abstract: Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.
  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.

*Sravan Danda,Aditya Challa,Shlok Mehendale,Snehanshu Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an architecture-agnostic method for test-time adaptation by adding an adapter network trained with quantile loss to handle distribution shifts in test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods modify classifier weights and are heavily architecture-dependent, lacking flexibility for generic architectures.

Method: An adapter network preprocesses input images and is trained using quantile loss, correcting distribution shifts by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles.

Result: The approach was validated on datasets like CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and TinyImageNet-C using classic convolutional and transformer models.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective and theoretically sound solution for architecture-agnostic test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting a classifier for the test data when the probability distribution of the test data slightly differs from that of the training data of the model. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing TTA approaches modify the weights of the classifier relying heavily on the architecture. It is unclear as to how these approaches are extendable to generic architectures. In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier. This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. We prove theoretically that under suitable conditions minimizing quantile loss can learn the optimal adapter. We validate our approach on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C by training both classic convolutional and transformer networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for antiviral peptide identification struggle to capture complex sequence dependencies and to differentiate between highly similar sequences, which is crucial for drug development.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage predictive framework (AVP-Pro) that uses hierarchical fusion of features, combining self-attention, CNNs, BiLSTMs, and contrastive learning with OHEM and BLOSUM62 for improved sequence differentiation.

Result: AVP-Pro outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving 95.31% accuracy and 0.9064 MCC in AVP identification, and accurately classified viral families and specific viruses even under small-sample conditions.

Conclusion: AVP-Pro is a highly accurate and interpretable tool for antiviral peptide prediction with a web interface for high-throughput drug screening.

Abstract: The accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is crucial for novel drug development. However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs. To further enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a user-friendly web interface, which is available at https://wwwy1031-avp-pro.hf.space.

*Kecheng Cai,Chao Peng,Chenyang Xu,Xia Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses QoS prediction, proposing a self-augmented strategy using iterative refinement with a mixture-of-experts model to overcome data sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the sparsity issue in QoS prediction for user-service interactions by leveraging feedback values, which are critical for personalized recommendations and service computing.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model that iteratively refines QoS predictions by masking predicted values and using them as input for further prediction.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baselines and achieves competitive results in QoS prediction.

Conclusion: The self-augmented iterative refinement approach effectively handles sparsity in QoS prediction, providing a promising solution for improved prediction accuracy in real-world applications.

Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in service computing and personalized recommendation. In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.
  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.

### [154] [Spurious Rewards Paradox: Mechanistically Understanding How RLVR Activates Memorization Shortcuts in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11061)
*Lecheng Yan,Ruizhe Li,Guanhua Chen,Qing Li,Jiahui Geng,Wenxi Li,Vincent Wang,Chris Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR is effective for LLM reasoning but can lead to performance gains with spurious rewards through memorization shortcuts rather than reasoning improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how spurious or incorrect rewards in RLVR can lead to improved model performance, uncovering mechanisms behind this phenomenon.

Method: The study uses investigations like Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations to identify an Anchor-Adapter circuit responsible for spurious reward processing.

Result: A functional anchor in middle layers retrieves memorized solutions while structural adapters transform representations, enabling memorization shortcuts. Scaling specific MLP keys allows bidirectional causal steering.

Conclusion: Mechanistic insights into how RLVR induces memorization provide a roadmap for mitigating data contamination in RL-tuned models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is highly effective for enhancing LLM reasoning, yet recent evidence shows models like Qwen 2.5 achieve significant gains even with spurious or incorrect rewards. We investigate this phenomenon and identify a "Perplexity Paradox": spurious RLVR triggers a divergence where answer-token perplexity drops while prompt-side coherence degrades, suggesting the model is bypassing reasoning in favor of memorization. Using Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations, we uncover a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit that facilitates this shortcut. We localize a Functional Anchor in the middle layers (L18-20) that triggers the retrieval of memorized solutions, followed by Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) that transform representations to accommodate the shortcut signal. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling specific MLP keys within this circuit allows for bidirectional causal steering-artificially amplifying or suppressing contamination-driven performance. Our results provide a mechanistic roadmap for identifying and mitigating data contamination in RLVR-tuned models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in current graph neural network-based fraud detection methods and proposes HIMVH, a hippocampus-inspired multi-view hypergraph learning model, achieving superior fraud detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in fraud detection caused by fraud camouflage and long-tailed data distributions, which existing methods fail to adequately address.

Method: The paper introduces HIMVH, which utilizes a cross-view inconsistency perception module and a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module inspired by hippocampal mechanisms to detect camouflaged frauds and rare fraudulent cases.

Result: HIMVH showed significant improvement, achieving 6.42% better AUC, 9.74% better F1-score, and 39.14% better average precision compared to 15 state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: HIMVH effectively addresses fraud camouflage and rare fraud detection, proving its efficacy in enhancing financial fraud detection mechanisms in web ecosystems.

Abstract: Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.

*Lele Zheng,Xiang Wang,Tao Zhang,Yang Cao,Ke Cheng,Yulong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DP-SFT, a novel method that improves differential privacy in fine-tuning language models by reducing noise impact through a low-dimensional subspace approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning language models often involves sensitive data, which raises privacy concerns. Differential privacy is a solution but degrades performance due to excessive noise in high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Method: DP-SFT identifies a low-dimensional subspace using principal gradient directions to capture task-specific updates. Gradients are projected, noise is added only to the subspace, and perturbed gradients are mapped back to the original parameter space.

Result: DP-SFT achieves improved accuracy, stability, convergence rate, and performance compared to standard DP fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: DP-SFT balances privacy and performance by effectively reducing the negative impact of differential privacy noise during fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on downstream tasks is crucial for realizing their cross-domain potential but often relies on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering accuracy can be improved by incorporating background knowledge. However, traditional constraint-generation methods are resource-intensive, prompting researchers to explore LLM-based automatic constraint generation.

Method: The authors introduce a novel constraint-generation method that uses set-based constraints instead of pairwise constraints, along with a constrained clustering algorithm incorporating confidence thresholds and penalty mechanisms to handle inaccuracies.

Result: The proposed method improves query efficiency and constraint accuracy, achieving clustering performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the number of LLM queries by over 20 times.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that LLM-generated constraints can enhance clustering quality efficiently, offering a cost-effective solution with similar accuracy to existing methods.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool that has garnered significant interest across a wide range of applications including text analysis. To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.

Abstract: Shape-morphing soft materials can enable diverse target morphologies through voxel-level material distribution design, offering significant potential for various applications.

S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in molecular property prediction, especially in few-shot scenarios, focusing on leveraging causal structures and functional group relationships in molecules.

Method: CaMol introduces a context graph for encoding chemical knowledge, a learnable atom masking strategy to identify causal substructures, and a distribution intervener to disentangle causal effects using backdoor adjustment.

Result: CaMol achieved superior accuracy and efficiency in few-shot molecular prediction tasks, proving its generalizability to unseen properties and aligning causal substructures with chemical knowledge.

Conclusion: CaMol demonstrates both high predictive performance and strong interpretability by effectively utilizing chemical causality and addressing confounding factors in molecular predictions.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.

TL;DR: This study compares supervised classification with unsupervised anomaly detection for predicting helicopter engine failures using real-world telemetry data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address operational disruptions, safety hazards, and repair costs caused by unexpected helicopter engine failures by exploring predictive maintenance methods.

Method: The study utilizes a supervised classification pipeline requiring labelled data, and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach with autoencoders, training on healthy engine data alone.

Result: Supervised models perform well when failure labels are available, while autoencoders effectively detect anomalies without annotated failure data, making them suitable for scarce-label scenarios.

Conclusion: Unsupervised learning, like autoencoders, is a promising method for fault detection in aerospace applications where failure data are limited.

Abstract: Unplanned engine failures in helicopters can lead to severe operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs. To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel algorithms, Lanczos Iteration (global) and Lanczos Push (local), for efficiently computing resistance distance on large graphs, improving both speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with slow convergence in resistance distance computation on large graphs, particularly when the graph Laplacian matrix has a large condition number.

Method: The authors propose Lanczos Iteration (a near-linear global method) and Lanczos Push (a local algorithm with graph size-independent time complexity) based on the Lanczos method to reduce dependence on the condition number.

Result: Lanczos Iteration achieves $tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ time complexity, and Lanczos Push achieves $tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under mild assumptions. Both methods outperform SOTA algorithms in efficiency and accuracy, as validated on eight real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms provide significant speed and accuracy improvements for resistance distance computation, addressing key limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

*Claudia Plant,Lena G. M. Bauer,Christian Böhm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses how clustering requires balancing abstraction and representation, highlighting methods like K-means, subspace, and deep clustering, and proposes future research directions to improve these methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of clustering complex, high-dimensional data by balancing abstraction and representation for better performance and interpretability.

Method: The paper reviews current clustering techniques such as K-means, subspace clustering, and deep clustering, focusing on their trade-offs, objectives, and strategies for abstraction and representation.

Result: The analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of different clustering approaches and suggests how combining abstraction and representation could advance clustering technology.

Conclusion: Future clustering algorithms should adaptively balance abstraction and representation, with inspiration from the human brain, to achieve improved interpretability, performance, and efficiency.

Abstract: How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.
  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.
  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.

*Pascal Schlachter,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called GMM-COMET, addressing continual source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), a setting for real-world applications where domain shifts occur sequentially between multiple unlabeled target domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of adapting neural networks in scenarios with sequential domain shifts while source data is unavailable and the label spaces may differ, called continual SF-UniDA, which has not been studied previously.

Method: The method, GMM-COMET, integrates Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework and introduces consistency losses for robustness during long adaptation sequences.

Result: GMM-COMET consistently improves performance over the source-only model across multiple adaptation scenarios, providing a strong baseline for continual SF-UniDA.

Conclusion: GMM-COMET demonstrates effective adaptation in continual SF-UniDA settings, offering improved stability and robustness, making it a pioneering baseline for this problem. Code is made publicly available.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Motivation: To prevent unplanned and costly failures by enabling early fault detection in hydraulic pumps.

Method: Implement two autoencoder schemes: feed-forward autoencoder analyzing sensor snapshots and LSTM autoencoder analyzing short temporal windows, both trained on normal data.

Result: Both models demonstrate high reliability in fault detection with healthy data despite not being trained on fault data.

Conclusion: Unsupervised autoencoder models can reliably detect faults, promising for industrial applications without requiring fault data during training.

Abstract: Unplanned failures in industrial hydraulic pumps can halt production and incur substantial costs. We explore two unsupervised autoencoder (AE) schemes for early fault detection: a feed-forward model that analyses individual sensor snapshots and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that captures short temporal windows. Both networks are trained only on healthy data drawn from a minute-level log of 52 sensor channels; evaluation uses a separate set that contains seven annotated fault intervals. Despite the absence of fault samples during training, the models achieve high reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity, privacy issues, and the lack of methods that capture the structural complexity (multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components) in time series data.

Method: The authors develop a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework. They encode time series into discrete tokens across multiple temporal resolutions and generate sequences hierarchically. Utilizing a dual-path VQ-VAE, they disentangle trend and seasonal components while adding a guidance-based reconstruction strategy for improved fine-grained seasonal patterns.

Result: Experiments across six datasets demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality time series compared to existing techniques. The model also uses fewer parameters and generates accurate long-term sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively generates high-quality, semantically meaningful time series, excels in long-term sequence generation, and overcomes structural and multi-scale challenges while being parameter efficient.

Abstract: Generative modeling offers a promising solution to data scarcity and privacy challenges in time series analysis. However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences.

### [167] [FAQ: Mitigating Quantization Error via Regenerating Calibration Data with Family-Aware Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11200)
*Haiyang Xiao,Weiqing Li,Jinyue Guo,Guochao Jiang,Guohua Liu,Yuewei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FAQ, a calibration data regeneration framework aimed at improving post-training quantization (PTQ) accuracy for large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PTQ methods rely on limited and unrepresentative calibration samples, leading to inaccuracies in quantization parameters and activation distribution biases during inference.

Method: The FAQ framework uses a larger LLM from the same family as the target model to regenerate more representative, high-fidelity calibration samples. These samples undergo expert-guided selection and re-normalization to improve PTQ effectiveness.

Result: FAQ reduces accuracy loss in PTQ by up to 28.5% compared to using traditional calibration data on benchmarks like Qwen3-8B.

Conclusion: The proposed FAQ framework significantly enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of PTQ for LLMs, offering a practical solution for deploying these models on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an efficient numerical compression scheme for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices, the representativeness and universality of calibration data remain a core bottleneck in determining the accuracy of quantization parameters. Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.

### [168] [SDFLoRA: Selective Dual-Module LoRA for Federated Fine-tuning with Heterogeneous Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11219)
*Zhikang Shen,Jianrong Lu,Haiyuan Wan,Jianhai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SDFLoRA, a federated learning method for adapting large language models while addressing rank heterogeneity and improving privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FL implementations for large language models face challenges with rank heterogeneity in low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA, leading to biased aggregation and weak privacy protection under differential privacy noise.

Method: SDFLoRA decomposes client adapters into a global transferable module and a local private module. It selectively aligns and aggregates the global module across clients while preserving local modules and optimizing privacy using differential privacy noise in the global module.

Result: Experiments on GLUE benchmarks showed that SDFLoRA achieves better utility-privacy trade-offs and outperforms existing federated LoRA baseline methods.

Conclusion: SDFLoRA is effective in addressing rank heterogeneity and improving privacy preservation in FL for large language models, ensuring robust and personalized adaptation over distributed data.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention as a way to enable privacy-preserving adaptation over distributed data. Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.

*Haochen Wu,Heng Wu,Benzhuo Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAD-BNO, a framework for operator learning that uses only boundary data and eliminates the need for full-domain sampling or external measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an operator learning framework that relies solely on boundary data to solve PDEs without requiring external measurements or simulations, thus achieving efficiency and scalability.

Method: By using the MAD method to synthesize training data from fundamental solutions, the proposed MAD-BNO learns boundary-to-boundary mappings through neural operators and recovers interior solutions using boundary integral formulations.

Result: The framework achieves competitive or better accuracy compared to existing methods for solving PDEs, with significantly reduced training time, and validates its effectiveness on benchmark tasks like Laplace and Poisson equations.

Conclusion: MAD-BNO is a scalable and data-efficient approach to learning operators for partial differential equations, offering flexibility in boundary conditions, extensibility to 3D problems, and reduced computational demands.

Abstract: For linear partial differential equations with known fundamental solutions, this work introduces a novel operator learning framework that relies exclusively on domain boundary data, including solution values and normal derivatives, rather than full-domain sampling. By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time. The framework is naturally extensible to three-dimensional problems and complex geometries.

### [170] [Knowledge is Not Enough: Injecting RL Skills for Continual Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11258)
*Pingzhi Tang,Yiding Wang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of current methods in updating knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a new framework called Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST) for efficient knowledge adaptation and skill transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to incorporate new knowledge due to their "knowledge cutoff," and methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fail to reliably enhance reasoning abilities with new information. Efficient adaptation remains a challenge because Reinforcement Learning (RL), while effective, is computationally expensive.

Method: The authors propose the Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST) framework, which leverages the observation that parameter updates by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. PaST works by extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain and linearly injecting it into a target model after lightweight SFT on new data, allowing for modular and effective skill transfer.

Result: PaST significantly improves performance in various experiments. On SQuAD, it achieves a 9.9-point improvement over the best baseline. On LooGLE, it provides an 8.0-point gain for long-context QA. For agentic tool use on ToolBench, it results in a +10.3-point improvement, demonstrating strong scalability and cross-domain adaptability.

Conclusion: PaST is a highly effective framework for equipping LLMs with new reasoning and knowledge manipulation capabilities efficiently. Its ability to transfer skills modularly and adapt to various domains signifies an advancement in knowledge adaptation techniques for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face the "knowledge cutoff" challenge, where their frozen parametric memory prevents direct internalization of new information. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.

*Lorenzo Tomada,Federico Pichi,Gianluigi Rozza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LD-GCN, a novel graph-based neural network architecture for improved model order reduction of dynamical systems described by PDEs, addressing gaps in prior methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack a combination of geometric inductive biases and dynamics-driven interpretability for nonlinear model order reduction of parameterized PDEs. This paper seeks to fill this gap.

Method: LD-GCN is proposed as a data-driven, encoder-free architecture that operates in reduced latent space and decodes solutions onto geometrically parameterized domains using GNNs, validated both mathematically and numerically.

Result: The LD-GCN framework demonstrates its efficacy in complex computational mechanics tasks, including bifurcation detection in Navier-Stokes equations, while supporting latent interpolation and zero-shot predictions.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust and interpretable method for latent dynamics modeling via GNNs, capable of reducing dynamical systems with improved efficiency and applicability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity and polynomial runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in agnostic boosting where existing algorithms achieve near-optimal sample complexity but with exponential runtime.

Method: Introducing a new agnostic boosting algorithm that achieves near-optimal sample complexity with polynomial-time operations for fixed problem parameters.

Result: The proposed algorithm reduces the computational burden while preserving theoretical optimality in terms of sample complexity.

Conclusion: This work advances the field of boosting in agnostic settings, providing a practical and efficient algorithm that balances computational efficiency and sample complexity.

Abstract: Boosting is a powerful method that turns weak learners, which perform only slightly better than random guessing, into strong learners with high accuracy. While boosting is well understood in the classic setting, it is less so in the agnostic case, where no assumptions are made about the data. Indeed, only recently was the sample complexity of agnostic boosting nearly settled arXiv:2503.09384, but the known algorithm achieving this bound has exponential running time. In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel diagnostic framework for ADHD by integrating urinary metabolomics with interpretable machine learning to identify biochemical markers, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop biology-based diagnostic tools for ADHD, addressing the limitations of current subjective diagnostic methods.

Method: Urinary metabolomics combined with a Closest Resemblance (CR) machine learning classifier was used to analyze metabolomic profiles and identify biochemical markers linked to ADHD.

Result: The CR model achieved an AUC > 0.97 using a panel of 14 metabolites, outperforming other classification algorithms and providing mechanistic insights.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning to provide objective, biologically informed ADHD diagnostics.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with limited objective diagnostic tools, highlighting the urgent need for objective, biology-based diagnostic frameworks in precision psychiatry. We integrate urinary metabolomics with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify biochemical signatures associated with ADHD. Targeted metabolomic profiles from 52 ADHD and 46 control participants were analyzed using a Closest Resemblance (CR) classifier with embedded feature selection. The CR model outperformed Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, achieving an AUC > 0.97 based on a reduced panel of 14 metabolites. These metabolites including dopamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and citrulline map to dopaminergic neurotransmission and amino acid metabolism pathways, offering mechanistic insight into ADHD pathophysiology. The CR classifier's transparent decision boundaries and low computational cost support integration into targeted metabolomic assays and future point of care diagnostic platforms. Overall, this work demonstrates a translational framework combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning to advance objective, biologically informed diagnostic strategies for ADHD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FORESTLLM integrates structural biases from decision forests with the semantic reasoning of large language models (LLMs), optimizing performance in few-shot tabular data scenarios without requiring LLM inference at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively learning from tabular data in settings with limited labeled examples is essential for high-stakes decisions in domains like healthcare and finance, but current methods struggle with stability and generalization.

Method: FORESTLLM combines the inductive structure of decision forests with LLM semantic reasoning during training, introducing semantic splitting and one-time inference mechanisms for robust tree structure and leaf node stabilization.

Result: FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on various few-shot classification and regression benchmarks by leveraging its hybrid approach.

Conclusion: This framework overcomes challenges in few-shot tabular learning by unifying decision forest structure and LLM semantic capabilities, improving robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Explored Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup, identifying Response Semantic Drift (RSD) issue and resolving it with the SPREAD framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potentials and limitations of combining DLMs with the RAG framework for improved natural language generation.

Method: Introduced SPREAD, a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy to address semantic drift in DLM decoding within RAG.

Result: SPREAD successfully enhances generation precision and mitigates Response Semantic Drift, making DLMs more effective in RAG setups.

Conclusion: DLMs can be leveraged in RAG frameworks with improved precision using SPREAD, showing strong promise and addressing semantic alignment challenges.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FEATHer, a highly efficient time-series forecasting model designed for edge devices with strict hardware constraints, showcasing superior performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the need for accurate long-term time-series forecasting in industrial environments using edge devices with severe limitations in parameters, latency, and memory.

Method: The paper introduces FEATHer, a model utilizing multiscale frequency decomposition, dense convolutions without recurrence or attention, adaptive frequency-aware gating, and sparse period kernels for efficient forecasting.

Result: FEATHer demonstrates exceptional performance with a minimal parameter count (as few as 400) and achieves the best results across eight benchmarks with an average rank of 2.05.

Conclusion: The research highlights that accurate and reliable long-term forecasting is feasible on constrained edge hardware, providing a solution suitable for real-time industrial applications.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental in industrial domains like manufacturing and smart factories. As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores offline reinforcement learning (RL) for developing an autonomous CPU power controller to improve energy efficiency of parallel applications with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy efficiency is critical in modern computing infrastructure due to its influence on system performance, cost, scalability, and durability. Despite the potential of reinforcement learning, challenges like noise and lack of models hinder using online RL for energy management.

Method: The study applies offline RL using a dataset of state transitions collected previously. A gray-box methodology is adopted, combining application-agnostic performance data and hardware counters, and is tested on compute and memory-bound benchmarks using Intel's Running Average Power Limit.

Result: The offline RL agent significantly reduces energy consumption while maintaining an acceptable level of performance degradation in live systems.

Conclusion: Offline RL offers a viable, effective solution for autonomous CPU power control, bypassing the challenges of online RL training and improving energy efficiency in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a paired autoencoder framework for solving inverse problems with inconsistent or biased observational data, demonstrating superior reconstruction and estimation in noisy scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in solving inverse problems when observational data is inconsistent, noisy, or biased, while maintaining adherence to physical models.

Method: The framework uses paired autoencoders—one for parameter space and another for observation space—connected via learned mappings between their latent spaces, enabling low-dimensional surrogate modeling and reconstruction of corrupted data.

Result: The paired autoencoders approach achieved more accurate data reconstruction and parameter estimation compared to traditional methods, particularly in handling data inconsistencies, as showcased in medical tomography and seismic-waveform inversion examples.

Conclusion: This novel framework proves effective for solving inverse problems under challenging observational conditions and can be generalized to various scientific and engineering fields.

Abstract: This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.

*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in systems with structured, local interactions by introducing the Diffusion Value Function (DVF) and related methods. DVF enhances agent learning and performance in such settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the challenge of credit assignment in large-scale multi-agent systems with structured, local interactions, where existing value function approaches are insufficiently aligned with the underlying graph-based structure.

Method: The key approach is the introduction of the Diffusion Value Function (DVF) for graph-based Markov decision processes. DVF diffuses rewards over an influence graph using temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. It is implemented with graph neural networks and incorporated into reinforcement learning via new methods like Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN).

Result: The proposed method, DA2C, achieves up to an 11% improvement in average rewards across various benchmark tasks compared to baseline methods, showcasing its efficacy in enhancing multi-agent learning and decision-making.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel and scalable solution for credit assignment in MARL settings with structured interactions. The proposed DVF and DA2C frameworks demonstrate significant advantages in terms of learning efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by stress-testing them under distribution shifts, structural changes, and long-horizon rollouts on various PDE families, revealing vulnerabilities like spectral bias and compounding errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FNOs have shown promise for learning PDE solution maps, but the understanding of their robustness under different conditions, including distribution shifts and perturbations, is limited.

Method: The authors systematically stress-test FNOs across different PDE families by applying controlled tests, such as parameter shifts, boundary condition changes, resolution extrapolation, and iterative rollouts, evaluating their performance across 1,000 models.

Result: The evaluation found issues like errors amplified under boundary condition shifts, spectral errors under resolution changes, and resilience to some input perturbations, exposing failure modes of FNOs.

Conclusion: The findings provide a detailed failure-mode atlas for FNOs, offering insights on improving their robustness in operator learning tasks.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.

Abstract: Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) and Lookup Table Networks (LUTNs) are demonstrated to be suitable for the automatic classification of electrocardiograms (ECGs) using the inter-patient paradigm. The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $jκ$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.

*Francisco Giral,Álvaro Manzano,Ignacio Gómez,Ricardo Vinuesa,Soledad Le Clainche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework designed for reconstructing high-resolution urban wind flow with limited sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of reconstructing urban wind flow for air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort in situations with sparse sensor data.

Method: GenDA combines a multiscale graph-based diffusion with classifier-free guidance. It uses a geometry-aware flow prior and a sensor-conditioned branch to learn and incorporate observational constraints. Training on CFD simulations allows generalization to unseen geometries and wind conditions.

Result: Compared to GNN baselines and classical data assimilation methods, GenDA achieved 25-57% lower RRMSE and 23-33% higher SSIM across tested meshes, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: GenDA provides a scalable, generative solution for geometry-aware data assimilation, showing promise for environmental monitoring in complex urban domains.

Abstract: Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.

### [183] [Low-Rank Key Value Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11471)
*James O'Neill,Robert Clancy,Mariia Matskevichus,Fergal Reid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Low-Rank KV Adaptation (LRKV), a modified attention mechanism reducing memory and compute demands for training and decoding in transformers, while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer pretraining faces increasing memory and compute constraints, particularly due to the KV cache bottleneck. Addressing this bottleneck is crucial for making pretraining and autoregressive decoding more efficient.

Method: The paper proposes LRKV, which combines a shared full-rank KV projection with low-rank, head-specific residuals in multi-head attention. This design allows for a trade-off between memory sharing and independent attention, while incorporating features from other methods like multi-query attention.

Result: Experiments show that LRKV achieves faster loss reduction, better downstream task performance, and lower validation perplexity. At the 2.5B parameter scale, it reduces KV memory by half and can train with 20-25% less compute while matching the quality of standard attention models.

Conclusion: LRKV is a practical, efficient alternative to standard attention mechanisms, suitable for scaling transformers under constrained memory and compute resources. It retains functional head diversity and outperforms or matches other attention optimization methods.

Abstract: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.
  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

*Ziqing Zeng,Abhimanyu Kumar,Chris H. Kim,Ulya R. Karpuzcu,Sachin S. Sapatnekar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to implement extractive summarization (ES) using low-energy CMOS Ising machines, achieving efficient, high-quality summaries for resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the accuracy of modern neural models in extractive summarization, their reliance on CPU/GPU infrastructures is energy-intensive and unsuitable for resource-limited environments, necessitating an alternative low-energy solution.

Method: The authors introduce a hardware-aware Ising formulation and a complete ES pipeline, including methods for precision loss compensation and problem decomposition, to enable the implementation of ES on low-power CMOS Ising machines.

Result: The proposed pipeline efficiently generates high-quality summaries on CNN/DailyMail dataset using integer-coupled Ising hardware, achieving 3-4.5x runtime improvements, significant energy reductions, and competitive summary quality compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: CMOS Ising machines demonstrate strong potential for real-time, low-energy text summarization, offering an efficient alternative for edge device deployment.

Abstract: Extractive summarization (ES) aims to generate a concise summary by selecting a subset of sentences from a document while maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.

TL;DR: Smart grids require resilient anomaly detection methods; this paper proposes quantum-enhanced solutions (QUPID and R-QUPID) for better detection and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart grids face cyber-physical threats, natural disasters, and adversarial vulnerabilities, requiring advanced detection systems.

Method: Quantum ML, specifically a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN), is utilized to enable advanced anomaly detection and improve scalability.

Result: QUPID and R-QUPID outperform conventional ML models in anomaly detection with greater resilience to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced designs offer practical and robust solutions for anomaly detection in large-scale smart grid systems.

Abstract: Smart grid infrastructures have revolutionized energy distribution, but their day-to-day operations require robust anomaly detection methods to counter risks associated with cyber-physical threats and system faults potentially caused by natural disasters, equipment malfunctions, and cyber attacks. Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the fragmentation and lack of standardization in Type 1 Diabetes datasets by presenting a unified, accessible data resource called the MetaboNet dataset, which consolidates multiple datasets for broader comparability and algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges posed by fragmented and non-standardized Type 1 Diabetes datasets, which hinder data integration and algorithm development.

Method: The paper consolidates multiple publicly available Type 1 Diabetes datasets, requiring continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump dosing records, along with auxiliary information where available. The resulting resource is distributed as public and DUA-restricted subsets, with processing pipelines provided for standardization.

Result: The MetaboNet dataset integrates data from 3135 subjects and accounts for 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it significantly larger and more comprehensive than existing datasets.

Conclusion: The MetaboNet dataset provides a standardized, generalizable, and publicly accessible resource for T1D research, enabling improved algorithmic development and comparability across studies.

Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of mitigating misuse of advanced language models by proposing improved activation probes and evaluating their generalization under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle misuse of increasingly powerful language models by bad actors and improve mitigation systems against such misuse.

Method: New probe architectures are developed and tested against distribution shifts like multi-turn conversations and jailbreak attempts. The study includes pairing probes with classifiers and leveraging AlphaEvolve for automation.

Result: The new probe architectures handle long-context shifts better and generalize more effectively across diverse distributions. Probes combined with classifiers achieve optimal results, and AlphaEvolve automation provides early promising results.

Conclusion: Improved probe designs and diverse training enhance misuse mitigation in language models, and automation shows potential in advancing safety research.

Abstract: Frontier language model capabilities are improving rapidly. We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.
  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.
  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.

*Anas Hajbi*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework using Genetic Programming to create domain-specific activation functions, achieving higher parameter efficiency and improved generalization across related scientific domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and unstructured approaches of generic activation functions in neural networks, especially for scientific data.

Method: Introduced Neuro-Symbolic Activation Discovery, which leverages Genetic Programming to derive interpretable activation functions from data and integrates them into neural networks.

Result: Achieved parameter efficiency (5.5x reduction) and competitive accuracy in experiments (e.g., Forest Cover dataset 82.4% with fewer parameters). Demonstrated cross-domain transferability between related scientific domains like Physics and Ecology.

Conclusion: Domain-specific activation functions outperform generic activations, ensuring efficiency and generalization. However, these functions are not universally transferable (e.g., Physics to Text).

Abstract: Modern neural networks rely on generic activation functions (ReLU, GELU, SiLU) that ignore the mathematical structure inherent in scientific data. We propose Neuro-Symbolic Activation Discovery, a framework that uses Genetic Programming to extract interpretable mathematical formulas from data and inject them as custom activation functions. Our key contribution is the discovery of a Geometric Transfer phenomenon: activation functions learned from particle physics data successfully generalize to ecological classification, outperforming standard activations (ReLU, GELU, SiLU) in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. On the Forest Cover dataset, our Hybrid Transfer model achieves 82.4% accuracy with only 5,825 parameters, compared to 83.4% accuracy requiring 31,801 parameters for a conventional heavy network -- a 5.5x parameter reduction with only 1% accuracy loss. We introduce a Parameter Efficiency Score ($E_{param} = AUC / \log_{10}(Params)$) and demonstrate that lightweight hybrid architectures consistently achieve 18-21% higher efficiency than over-parameterized baselines. Crucially, we establish boundary conditions: while Physics to Ecology transfer succeeds (both involve continuous Euclidean measurements), Physics to Text transfer fails (discrete word frequencies require different mathematical structures). Our work opens pathways toward domain-specific activation libraries for efficient scientific machine learning.

TL;DR: The study explores the use of line-based event preprocessing to optimize energy usage in neuromorphic vision for embedded applications, achieving efficiency and maintaining classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address energy efficiency challenges in neuromorphic vision systems while processing dynamic visual data, particularly for embedded applications.

Method: The researchers introduced line-based event preprocessing in an end-to-end neuromorphic line detection mechanism to optimize event data for reduced energy consumption and improved neuromorphic classification efficiency.

Result: The study demonstrated that preprocessing event data allows for a trade-off between energy consumption and performance, maintaining or even enhancing classification accuracy on three benchmark event-based datasets.

Conclusion: Event preprocessing significantly improves energy efficiency in neuromorphic vision systems, offering a pathway toward more resource-efficient neuromorphic computing for dynamic visual data.

Abstract: Neuromorphic vision made significant progress in recent years, thanks to the natural match between spiking neural networks and event data in terms of biological inspiration, energy savings, latency and memory use for dynamic visual data processing. However, optimising its energy requirements still remains a challenge within the community, especially for embedded applications. One solution may reside in preprocessing events to optimise data quantity thus lowering the energy cost on neuromorphic hardware, proportional to the number of synaptic operations. To this end, we extend an end-to-end neuromorphic line detection mechanism to introduce line-based event data preprocessing. Our results demonstrate on three benchmark event-based datasets that preprocessing leads to an advantageous trade-off between energy consumption and classification performance. Depending on the line-based preprocessing strategy and the complexity of the classification task, we show that one can maintain or increase the classification accuracy while significantly reducing the theoretical energy consumption. Our approach systematically leads to a significant improvement of the neuromorphic classification efficiency, thus laying the groundwork towards a more frugal neuromorphic computer vision thanks to event preprocessing.

### [190] [Pruning as Evolution: Emergent Sparsity Through Selection Dynamics in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10765)
*Zubair Shah,Noaman Khan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evolutionary approach to pruning in neural networks, treating parameter groups as evolving populations under selection pressure, in contrast to traditional centralized pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning techniques create sparsity by explicit interventions such as thresholds or penalties, which do not align with the decentralized and stochastic nature of neural network training.

Method: The authors model parameter groups as populations that evolve under continuous selection pressure, with components losing influence based on their fitness without discrete pruning schedules.

Result: Experimental validation is conducted using a scaled MLP model on MNIST. Post-training hard pruning achieves a tradeoff between sparsity and test accuracy: pruning 35% achieves ≈95.5% accuracy, and pruning 50% results in ≈88.3-88.6% accuracy.

Conclusion: Evolutionary selection demonstrated effective at yielding measurable sparsity and accuracy tradeoffs, while avoiding discrete pruning schedules during training.

Abstract: Neural networks are commonly trained in highly overparameterized regimes, yet empirical evidence consistently shows that many parameters become redundant during learning. Most existing pruning approaches impose sparsity through explicit intervention, such as importance-based thresholding or regularization penalties, implicitly treating pruning as a centralized decision applied to a trained model. This assumption is misaligned with the decentralized, stochastic, and path-dependent character of gradient-based training. We propose an evolutionary perspective on pruning: parameter groups (neurons, filters, heads) are modeled as populations whose influence evolves continuously under selection pressure. Under this view, pruning corresponds to population extinction: components with persistently low fitness gradually lose influence and can be removed without discrete pruning schedules and without requiring equilibrium computation. We formalize neural pruning as an evolutionary process over population masses, derive selection dynamics governing mass evolution, and connect fitness to local learning signals. We validate the framework on MNIST using a population-scaled MLP (784--512--256--10) with 768 prunable neuron populations. All dynamics reach dense baselines near 98\% test accuracy. We benchmark post-training hard pruning at target sparsity levels (35--50\%): pruning 35\% yields $\approx$95.5\% test accuracy, while pruning 50\% yields $\approx$88.3--88.6\%, depending on the dynamic. These results demonstrate that evolutionary selection produces a measurable accuracy--sparsity tradeoff without explicit pruning schedules during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address computational difficulties in high-dimensional portfolio optimization under complex constraints, where traditional methods struggle with convergence and exploration balance.

Method: An enhanced Sharpe ratio-based model is developed with adaptive penalty terms for constraint handling. A QHDE algorithm is introduced, incorporating quantum-inspired mechanisms, chaos-based initialization, and advanced perturbation techniques to improve optimization.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed QHDE model improves optimization performance by up to 73.4%, delivering faster convergence, higher precision, and robustness compared to seven other algorithms.

Conclusion: The QHDE algorithm is highly effective for portfolio optimization, offering advancements in computational finance and demonstrating the utility of quantum-inspired evolutionary methods for complex problems.

Abstract: High-dimensional portfolio optimization faces significant computational challenges under complex constraints, with traditional optimization methods struggling to balance convergence speed and global exploration capability. To address this, firstly, we introduce an enhanced Sharpe ratio-based model that incorporates all constraints into the objective function using adaptive penalty terms, transforming the original constrained problem into an unconstrained single-objective formulation. This approach preserves financial interpretability while simplifying algorithmic implementation. To efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem, we propose a Quantum Hybrid Differential Evolution (QHDE) algorithm, which integrates Quantum-inspired probabilistic behavior into the standard DE framework. QHDE employs a Schrodinger-inspired probabilistic mechanism for population evolution, enabling more flexible and diversified solution updates. To further enhance performance, a good point set-chaos reverse learning strategy is adopted to generate a well-dispersed initial population, and a dynamic elite pool combined with Cauchy-Gaussian hybrid perturbations strengthens global exploration and mitigates premature convergence. Experimental validation on CEC benchmarks and real-world portfolios involving 20 to 80 assets demonstrates that QHDE's performance improves by up to 73.4%. It attains faster convergence, higher solution precision, and greater robustness than seven state-of-the-art counterparts, thereby confirming its suitability for complex, high-dimensional portfolio optimization and advancing quantum-inspired evolutionary research in computational finance.

Motivation: The paper aims to examine how different neural plasticity mechanisms impact learning outcomes in spiking neural networks and their potential for artificial intelligence frameworks.

Method: A winner-take-all network with spiking neurons was implemented in Python, incorporating neural plasticity mechanisms like STDP and synaptic scaling. Experimental evaluations were performed by tweaking parameters and testing classification performance.

Result: Synaptic scaling based on the L2 norm improved classification performance, achieving 88.84% accuracy with MNIST and 68.01% with Fashion-MNIST after one epoch.

Conclusion: The L2-norm-based synaptic scaling proved effective in improving learning in SNNs, showing promise for artificial intelligence applications employing neural plasticity mechanisms.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) employing unsupervised learning methods inspired by neural plasticity are expected to be a new framework for artificial intelligence. In this study, we investigated the effect of multiple types of neural plasticity, such as spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) and synaptic scaling, on the learning in a winner-take-all (WTA) network composed of spiking neurons. We implemented a WTA network with multiple types of neural plasticity using Python. The MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets were used for training and testing. We varied the number of neurons, the time constant of STDP, and the normalization method used in synaptic scaling to compare classification accuracy. The results demonstrated that synaptic scaling based on the L2 norm was the most effective in improving classification performance. By implementing L2-norm-based synaptic scaling and setting the number of neurons in both excitatory and inhibitory layers to 400, the network achieved classification accuracies of 88.84 % on the MNIST dataset and 68.01 % on the Fashion-MNIST dataset after one epoch of training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a KPI-driven GA-based pipeline for the 3D bin packing problem (3D-BPP), achieving better space utilization and improved feasibility for industrial deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of classical and metaheuristic methods, the motivation lies in creating solutions for 3D-BPP that balance industrial constraints such as stability, balance, and handling feasibility while scaling to real-world dimensions.

Method: A hybrid methodology using genetic algorithms with layer-based chromosome representation, domain-specific operators, and constructive heuristics; key performance indicators (KPIs) are integrated into a multi-objective fitness function.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art techniques on the BED-BPP benchmark, achieving up to 35% higher space utilization, 15-20% stronger surface support, and lower performance variance across orders.

Conclusion: The Hybrid-GA pipeline offers a feasible and efficient solution for industrial-scale 3D-BPP, outperforming existing methods in key metrics with minimal runtime costs, thus suitable for batch-scale deployment.

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is a longstanding challenge in operations research and logistics. Classical heuristics and constructive methods can generate packings quickly, but often fail to address industrial constraints such as stability, balance, and handling feasibility. Metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (GAs) provide flexibility and the ability to optimize across multiple objectives; however, pure GA approaches frequently struggle with efficiency, parameter sensitivity, and scalability to industrial order sizes. This gap is especially evident when scaling to real-world pallet dimensions, where even state-of-the-art algorithms often fail to achieve robust, deployable solutions. We propose a KPI-driven GA-based pipeline for industrial 3D-BPP that integrates key performance indicators directly into a multi-objective fitness function. The methodology combines a layer-based chromosome representation with domain-specific operators and constructive heuristics to balance efficiency and feasibility. On the BED-BPP benchmark of 1,500 real-world orders, our Hybrid-GA pipeline consistently outperforms heuristic- and learning-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 35% higher space utilization and 15 to 20% stronger surface support, with lower variance across orders. These improvements come at a modest runtime cost but remain feasible for batch-scale deployment, yielding stable, balanced, and space-efficient packings.

*Dimitar Nedanovski,Svetoslav Nenov,Dimitar Pilev*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores first-hitting times in Differential Evolution (DE) using conditional hazard framework, with both theoretical formulation and empirical results on the L-SHADE algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework for analyzing the first-hitting times in DE without relying on traditional methods like Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments.

Method: A conditional hazard framework is proposed where survival probability is expressed through conditional first-hit probabilities. L-SHADE algorithm's properties are studied using explicit bounds and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on a benchmark test suite.

Result: The study demonstrates three empirical regimes for hitting times: concentrated success bursts, approximate geometric tails, and intractable cases of no success. The theory separates theoretical constants from empirical observations and offers tail-bound envelopes for survival probabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective at explaining the burst-like success behavior and highlights the limitations of constant-hazard models in practical scenarios of the L-SHADE algorithm.

Abstract: We study first-hitting times in Differential Evolution (DE) through a conditional hazard frame work. Instead of analyzing convergence via Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments, we ex press the survival probability of a measurable target set $A$ as a product of conditional first-hit probabilities (hazards) $p_t=\Prob(E_t\mid\mathcal F_{t-1})$. This yields distribution-free identities for survival and explicit tail bounds whenever deterministic lower bounds on the hazard hold on the survival event.
  For the L-SHADE algorithm with current-to-$p$best/1 mutation, we construct a checkable algorithmic witness event $\mathcal L_t$ under which the conditional hazard admits an explicit lower bound depending only on sampling rules, population size, and crossover statistics. This separates theoretical constants from empirical event frequencies and explains why worst-case constant-hazard bounds are typically conservative.
  We complement the theory with a Kaplan--Meier survival analysis on the CEC2017 benchmark suite . Across functions and budgets, we identify three distinct empirical regimes: (i) strongly clustered success, where hitting times concentrate in short bursts; (ii) approximately geometric tails, where a constant-hazard model is accurate; and (iii) intractable cases with no observed hits within the evaluation horizon. The results show that while constant-hazard bounds provide valid tail envelopes, the practical behavior of L-SHADE is governed by burst-like transitions rather than homogeneous per-generati on success probabilities.

### [195] [Balanced allocation: considerations from large scale service environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10874)
*Amer Diwan,Prabhakar Raghavan,Eli Upfal*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing d-way balanced allocation for large-scale systems by addressing bursts, job priorities, and noise, supported by simulations and analytical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to adapt d-way balanced allocation for real-world challenges in large-scale cloud systems, such as unexpected demand spikes, priority handling, and dealing with noisy or stale data.

Method: The authors use extensive simulations and analytical modeling to evaluate and extend the capabilities of d-way balanced allocation under various practical constraints.

Result: The study showed that d-way balanced allocation can quickly recover from bursts, handle priorities gracefully, and tolerate noisy information effectively, with insights backed by simulations and analytical models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that d-way balanced allocation is robust and adaptable to real-world system conditions, providing valuable design guidelines for cloud applications.

Abstract: We study d-way balanced allocation, which assigns each incoming job to the lightest loaded among d randomly chosen servers. While prior work has extensively studied the performance of the basic scheme, there has been less published work on adapting this technique to many aspects of large-scale systems. Based on our experience in building and running planet-scale cloud applications, we extend the understanding of d-way balanced allocation along the following dimensions:
  (i) Bursts: Events such as breaking news can produce bursts of requests that may temporarily exceed the servicing capacity of the system. Thus, we explore what happens during a burst and how long it takes for the system to recover from such bursts. (ii) Priorities: Production systems need to handle jobs with a mix of priorities (e.g., user facing requests may be high priority while other requests may be low priority). We extend d-way balanced allocation to handle multiple priorities. (iii) Noise: Production systems are often typically distributed and thus d-way balanced allocation must work with stale or incorrect information. Thus we explore the impact of noisy information and their interactions with bursts and priorities.
  We explore the above using both extensive simulations and analytical arguments. Specifically we show, (i) using simulations, that d-way balanced allocation quickly recovers from bursts and can gracefully handle priorities and noise; and (ii) that analysis of the underlying generative models complements our simulations and provides insight into our simulation results.

### [196] [Cutting Corners on Uncertainty: Zonotope Abstractions for Stream-based Runtime Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11358)
*Bernd Finkbeiner,Martin Fränzle,Florian Kohn,Paul Kröger*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper explores using zonotopes as an efficient abstraction technique for stream-based monitoring to address sensor-induced errors and memory growth issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of precise stream-based monitoring under sensor imprecision and errors, without unconstrained memory growth in safety-critical systems.

Method: The authors propose using zonotopes as an abstract domain to monitor RLola specifications, comparing strategies for zonotope over-approximation to evaluate memory efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Zonotopes accurately represent the affine state of monitors, and their over-approximation results in sound, bounded-memory monitors with evaluated performance and false-positive rates.

Conclusion: Zonotopes offer a practical solution for bounded-memory monitoring while maintaining soundness and efficiency in managing sensor error propagation.

Abstract: Stream-based monitoring assesses the health of safety-critical systems by transforming input streams of sensor measurements into output streams that determine a verdict. These inputs are often treated as accurate representations of the physical state, although real sensors introduce calibration and measurement errors. Such errors propagate through the monitor's computations and can distort the final verdict. Affine arithmetic with symbolic slack variables can track these errors precisely, but independent measurement noise introduces a fresh slack variable upon each measurement event, causing the monitor's state representation to grow without bound over time. Therefore, any bounded-memory monitoring algorithm must unify slack variables at runtime in a way that generates a sound approximation.
  This paper introduces zonotopes as an abstract domain for online monitoring of RLola specifications. We demonstrate that zonotopes precisely capture the affine state of the monitor and that their over-approximation produces a sound bounded-memory monitor. We present a comparison of different zonotope over-approximation strategies in the context of runtime monitoring, evaluating their performance and false-positive rates.

### [197] [Qihe: A General-Purpose Static Analysis Framework for Verilog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11408)
*Qinlin Chen,Nairen Zhang,Jinpeng Wang,Jiacai Cui,Tian Tan,Xiaoxing Ma,Chang Xu,Jian Lu,Yue Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Qihe, a static analysis framework for Verilog, designed to address the absence of similar tools in hardware development and showcasing promising results with bug detection and security analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the lack of general-purpose static analysis frameworks in hardware, which hinders the potential for advanced analysis tools similar to those in software.

Method: The authors developed Qihe with an analysis-oriented front-end, Verilog-specific intermediate representation (IR), and a suite of fundamental analyses tailored to hardware-specific characteristics like bit-vector arithmetic and hardware concurrency.

Result: Qihe detected 9 previously unknown bugs in popular hardware projects, identified issues beyond existing Verilog static analysis tools, and revealed 16 vulnerabilities in real-world hardware.

Conclusion: By open-sourcing Qihe’s 100K+ lines of code, the authors aim to encourage further innovation in hardware static analysis and create a thriving ecosystem as seen in software.

Abstract: In the past decades, static analysis has thrived in software, facilitating applications in bug detection, security, and program understanding. These advanced analyses are largely underpinned by general-purpose static analysis frameworks, which offer essential infrastructure to streamline their development. Conversely, hardware lacks such a framework, which overshadows the promising opportunities for sophisticated static analysis in hardware, hindering achievements akin to those witnessed in software. We thus introduce Qihe, the first general-purpose static analysis framework for Verilog -- a highly challenging endeavor given the absence of precedents in hardware. Qihe features an analysis-oriented front end, a Verilog-specific IR, and a suite of diverse fundamental analyses that capture essential hardware-specific characteristics -- such as bit-vector arithmetic, register synchronization, and digital component concurrency -- and enable the examination of intricate hardware data and control flows. These fundamental analyses are designed to support a wide array of hardware analysis clients. To validate Qihe's utility, we further developed a set of clients spanning bug detection, security, and program understanding. Our preliminary experimental results are highly promising; for example, Qihe uncovered 9 previously unknown bugs in popular real-world hardware projects (averaging 1.5K+ GitHub stars), all of which were confirmed by developers; moreover, Qihe successfully identified 18 bugs beyond the capabilities of existing static analyses for Verilog bug detection (i.e., linters), and detected 16 vulnerabilities in real-world hardware programs. By open-sourcing Qihe, which comprises over 100K lines of code, we aim to inspire further innovation and applications of sophisticated static analysis for hardware, aspiring to foster a similarly vibrant ecosystem that software analysis enjoys.

Result: The application of PMC facilitated the selection of verified RAS designs and demonstrated its practicality in agricultural robotics concept evaluation.

Conclusion: PMC enhances systematic design evaluation and contributes to creating safer, more reliable autonomous systems while providing a structured approach for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Safety and reliability play a crucial role when designing Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS). Early consideration of hazards, risks and mitigation actions -- already in the concept study phase -- are important steps in building a solid foundations for the subsequent steps in the system engineering life cycle. The complex nature of RAS, as well as the uncertain and dynamic environments the robots operate within, do not merely effect fault management and operation robustness, but also makes the task of system design concept selection, a hard problem to address. Approaches to tackle the mentioned challenges and their implications on system design, range from ad-hoc concept development and design practices, to systematic, statistical and analytical techniques of Model Based Systems Engineering. In this paper, we propose a methodology to apply a formal method, namely Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC), to enable systematic evaluation and analysis of a given set of system design concepts, ultimately leading to a set of Verified Designs (VD). We illustrate the application of the suggested methodology -- using PRISM as probabilistic model checker -- to a practical RAS concept selection use-case from agriculture robotics. Along the way, we also develop and present a domain-specific Design Evaluation Criteria for agri-RAS.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical control framework that integrates power prediction and reinforcement learning to enhance energy efficiency for wheeled-legged robots, demonstrating up to 35% energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is addressing the energy optimization challenges faced by wheeled-legged robots navigating diverse environments.

Method: The method includes a hierarchical approach integrating predictive power modeling with residual reinforcement learning, including a novel power prediction network enabling intelligent gait selection and fine-tuning through reinforcement learning.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates a 35% reduction in energy consumption compared to fixed-gait approaches and robust performance across simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating predictive modeling and reinforcement learning offers significant advantages in energy efficiency and versatility for wheeled-legged robots.

Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the versatility of legs, but face significant energy optimization challenges when navigating diverse environments. In this work, we present a hierarchical control framework that integrates predictive power modeling with residual reinforcement learning to optimize omnidirectional locomotion efficiency for wheeled quadrupedal robots. Our approach employs a novel power prediction network that forecasts energy consumption across different gait patterns over a 1-second horizon, enabling intelligent selection of the most energy-efficient nominal gait. A reinforcement learning policy then generates residual adjustments to this nominal gait, fine-tuning the robot's actions to balance energy efficiency with performance objectives. Comparative analysis shows our method reduces energy consumption by up to 35\% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a modified Unitree Go1 platform, demonstrating robust performance even under external disturbances.

### [202] [Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for Vehicle Platoons with State-Dependent Friction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10724)
*Rishabh Dev Yadav*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of maintaining formation control in multi-robot vehicle platoons under uncertain friction forces and external disturbances, proposing an adaptive sliding mode controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for effective formation control in vehicle platoons, particularly in dealing with unpredictable frictional forces that vary with surface, tire wear, and speed.

Method: The research introduces a two-stage adaptive sliding mode controller: first calculating desired velocities via kinematics and then utilizing dynamics for command generation, separating control tasks for efficiency and robustness.

Result: The proposed controller demonstrates the ability to handle unknown frictional forces and maintain predefined inter-robot distances while regulating speed.

Conclusion: This method simplifies multi-robot control under dynamic and uncertain conditions, offering robust formation management for wheeled mobile robots.

Abstract: Multi-robot formation control has various applications in domains such as vehicle troops, platoons, payload transportation, and surveillance. Maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon requires designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters while maintaining a predefined safe distance between the robots. A crucial challenge in this context is dealing with the unknown/uncertain friction forces between wheels and the ground, which vary with changes in road surface, wear in tires, and speed of the vehicle. Although state-of-the-art adaptive controllers can handle a priori bounded uncertainties, they struggle with accurately modeling and identifying frictional forces, which are often state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded.
  This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons that can handle the unknown and complex behavior of frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures. The controller uses the adaptive sliding mode control techniques to regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance, even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This approach involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates the desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; and second, the dynamics model generates the commands to achieve the desired motion. By separating the kinematics and dynamics of the robot, this approach can simplify the control problem and allow for more efficient and robust control of the wheeled mobile robot.

*Hieu Do Quang,Chien Truong-Quoc,Quoc Van Tran*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores a diffusion-based planner for leader-follower formation control in cluttered spaces, ensuring smooth motion and reliable trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in multi-agent formation control in cluttered environments, focusing on generating reliable and smooth motion paths.

Method: The method uses a diffusion-based policy to generate trajectories for leaders as a rigid bar, while followers track the leaders using a distance-constrained controller based on relative local positions.

Result: The approach demonstrates smooth motions, low tracking errors, but limitations in obstacle-free narrow spaces and unseen configurations during training.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show promising potential for multi-agent formation planning, but effectiveness depends on obstacle configuration and training data coverage.

Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based planner for leader--follower formation control in cluttered environments. The diffusion policy is used to generate the trajectory of the midpoint of two leaders as a rigid bar in the plane, thereby defining their desired motion paths in a planar formation. While the followers track the leaders and form desired foramtion geometry using a distance-constrained formation controller based only on the relative positions in followers' local coordinates. The proposed approach produces smooth motions and low tracking errors, with most failures occurring in narrow obstacle-free space, or obstacle configurations that are not in the training data set. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models for reliable multi-agent formation planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an intuitive and transparent physical human-robot interaction system that adapts to user preferences and communicates its actions clearly.

Result: BRIDGE was tested with 18 older adults, showing effectiveness in real-time trajectory modification and improved interactivity and transparency due to verbal feedback.

Conclusion: Incorporating bidirectional communication and verbal feedback improves intuitiveness and user satisfaction in human-robot interaction for physical assistance tasks.

Abstract: Effective physical human-robot interaction requires systems that are not only adaptable to user preferences but also transparent about their actions. This paper introduces BRIDGE, a system for bidirectional human-robot communication in physical assistance. Our method allows users to modify a robot's planned trajectory -- position, velocity, and force -- in real time using natural language. We utilize a large language model (LLM) to interpret any trajectory modifications implied by user commands in the context of the planned motion and conversation history. Importantly, our system provides verbal feedback in response to the user, either assuring any resulting changes or posing a clarifying question. We evaluated our method in a user study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks, comparing BRIDGE to an ablation without verbal feedback and a baseline. Results show that participants successfully used the system to modify trajectories in real time. Moreover, the bidirectional feedback led to significantly higher ratings of interactivity and transparency, demonstrating that the robot's verbal response is critical for a more intuitive user experience.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in underwater stereo depth estimation by proposing a novel sim-to-real training framework, improving SLAM performance for underwater robots, and introduces a real-world dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve the perceptual capabilities of underwater robots by tackling poor depth estimation caused by environmental degradation, lack of underwater datasets, and the ineffectiveness of existing stereo estimation networks on underwater scenes.

Method: The authors developed a sim-to-real framework for training stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data combined with self-supervised fine-tuning. This framework integrates stereo cameras with motion sensors into a real-time SLAM system.

Result: The proposed approach enhances stereo depth estimation and addresses key challenges for underwater robots, producing accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstructions of shipwreck sites. A new dataset was also collected and used for validation.

Conclusion: The paper provides a practical solution to underwater stereo vision challenges, improving SLAM systems' accuracy and paving the way for better underwater exploration and mapping with robots.

Abstract: Localization and mapping are core perceptual capabilities for underwater robots. Stereo cameras provide a low-cost means of directly estimating metric depth to support these tasks. However, despite recent advances in stereo depth estimation on land, computing depth from image pairs in underwater scenes remains challenging. In underwater environments, images are degraded by light attenuation, visual artifacts, and dynamic lighting conditions. Furthermore, real-world underwater scenes frequently lack rich texture useful for stereo depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. As a result, stereo estimation networks trained on in-air data cannot transfer directly to the underwater domain. In addition, there is a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training of neural networks. Poor underwater depth estimation is compounded in stereo-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, making it a fundamental challenge for underwater robot perception. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enables sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning. We leverage our learned depth predictions to develop \algname, a novel framework for real-time underwater SLAM that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements. Lastly, we collect a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys using an underwater robot. Our dataset features over 24,000 stereo pairs, along with high-quality, dense photogrammetry models and reference trajectories for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed training approach on real-world data for improving stereo estimation in the underwater domain and for enabling accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.

### [206] [Approximately Optimal Global Planning for Contact-Rich SE(2) Manipulation on a Graph of Reachable Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10827)
*Simin Liu,Tong Zhao,Bernhard Paus Graesdal,Peter Werner,Jiuguang Wang,John Dolan,Changliu Liu,Tao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for globally optimized contact-rich manipulation (CRM), improving efficiency and success rate in object handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CRM planners focus more on feasibility than optimality, hindering the potential of CRM for efficient and natural manipulation.

Method: The approach involves two phases: offline graph construction of mutual reachable sets and online global optimization planning across the graph.

Result: In tests, the method reduced task cost by 61%, achieved a 91% success rate over 250 queries, and maintained sub-minute query times.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that globally optimized CRM is now practical for real-world applications, offering significant advancements in task efficiency and success rate.

Abstract: If we consider human manipulation, it is clear that contact-rich manipulation (CRM)-the ability to use any surface of the manipulator to make contact with objects-can be far more efficient and natural than relying solely on end-effectors (i.e., fingertips). However, state-of-the-art model-based planners for CRM are still focused on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit CRM's advantages. We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%. It also achieves a 91% success rate across 250 queries and maintains sub-minute query times, ultimately demonstrating that globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for precise real-time gait phase detection in lower limb exoskeletons and prostheses while reducing system complexity and control latency.

Method: The method involves a minimalist approach using a low-cost IMU on a crutch handgrip combined with a five-phase gait classification and a Finite State Machine for biomechanical consistency. Three deep learning models were evaluated, with a focus on adaptability and low latency.

Result: The Temporal Convolutional Network outperformed other architectures, achieving a 94% success rate in crutch step detection and generalizing effectively to a paralyzed user.

Conclusion: This framework offers a high-performance, cost-effective solution for real-time control of exoskeletons and prostheses, ensuring synchronized movement and safety even with minimal data and hardware requirements.

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons and prostheses require precise, real time gait phase and step detections to ensure synchronized motion and user safety. Conventional methods often rely on complex force sensing hardware that introduces control latency. This paper presents a minimalist framework utilizing a single, low cost Inertial-Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated into the crutch hand grip, eliminating the need for mechanical modifications. We propose a five phase classification system, including standard gait phases and a non locomotor auxiliary state, to prevent undesired motion. Three deep learning architectures were benchmarked on both a PC and an embedded system. To improve performance under data constrained conditions, models were augmented with a Finite State Machine (FSM) to enforce biomechanical consistency. The Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) emerged as the superior architecture, yielding the highest success rates and lowest latency. Notably, the model generalized to a paralyzed user despite being trained exclusively on healthy participants. Achieving a 94% success rate in detecting crutch steps, this system provides a high performance, cost effective solution for real time exoskeleton control.

*Ludovic Righetti,Vincent Boulanin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the dual-use risks of open access in robotics and proposes a roadmap to address these challenges responsibly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the dual-use risks in robotics exacerbated by open access and the lack of specific regulations to guide responsible research and innovation.

Method: Proposes a roadmap focusing on four key practices: education in responsible robotics, promoting risk assessment, controlling high-risk material dissemination, and establishing red lines.

Result: Identifies the need for and proposes actionable guidance for responsible robotics research.

Conclusion: The robotics community must create sector-specific policies to responsibly navigate dual-use risks and open access challenges.

Abstract: Open access to publication, software and hardware is central to robotics: it lowers barriers to entry, supports reproducible science and accelerates reliable system development. However, openness also exacerbates the inherent dual-use risks associated with research and innovation in robotics. It lowers barriers for states and non-state actors to develop and deploy robotics systems for military use and harmful purposes. Compared to other fields of engineering where dual-use risks are present - e.g., those that underlie the development of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons) and even the field of AI, robotics offers no specific regulation and little guidance as to how research and innovation may be conducted and disseminated responsibly. While other fields can be used for guidance, robotics has its own needs and specificities which have to be taken into account. The robotics community should therefore work toward its own set of sector-specific guidance and possibly regulation. To that end, we propose a roadmap focusing on four practices: a) education in responsible robotics; b) incentivizing risk assessment; c) moderating the diffusion of high-risk material; and d) developing red lines.

### [209] [Where to Touch, How to Contact: Hierarchical RL-MPC Framework for Geometry-Aware Long-Horizon Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10930)
*Zhixian Xie,Yu Xiang,Michael Posa,Wanxin Jin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical RL-MPC framework for dexterous manipulation. It achieves efficient task success, reduced data needs, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end visuomotor policies struggle with data inefficiency, poor task generalization, and simulation-to-reality transfer in dexterous manipulation tasks.

Method: The framework combines high-level RL to predict contact intentions and low-level MPC to optimize robot actions based on contact dynamics, leveraging hierarchical task structuring.

Result: The system performs near-perfect on non-prehensile tasks with significantly reduced data requirements and robust zero-shot sim-to-real capabilities.

Conclusion: Hierarchical approaches leveraging geometry, kinematics, and contact dynamics are promising for improving dexterous manipulation efficiency and transferability.

Abstract: A key challenge in contact-rich dexterous manipulation is the need to jointly reason over geometry, kinematic constraints, and intricate, nonsmooth contact dynamics. End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. It achieves near-100% success with substantially reduced data (10x less than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Method: A camera module with a single-board computer, battery, and suction cup is attached to the load, streaming real-time images to a host computer for operator guidance.

Result: Preliminary experiments showed successful real-time image acquisition and transmission, verifying the feasibility of the system.

Conclusion: The system enhances construction site safety by providing crane operators direct visual feedback of hidden landing spots.

Abstract: Cranes have long been essential equipment for lifting and placing heavy loads in construction projects. This study focuses on the lowering phase of crane operation, the stage in which the load is moved to the desired location. During this phase, a constant challenge exists: the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point. As a result, operators traditionally have to rely on verbal or gestural instructions from ground personnel, which significantly impacts site safety. To alleviate this constraint, the proposed system incorporates a attachable camera module designed to be attached directly to the load via a suction cup. This module houses a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. After installation, it streams and processes images of the ground directly below the load in real time to generate installation guidance. Simultaneously, this guidance is transmitted to and monitored by a host computer. Preliminary experiments were conducted by attaching this module to a test object, confirming the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission. This approach has the potential to significantly improve safety on construction sites by providing crane operators with an instant visual reference of hidden landing zones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenges of long-horizon task execution and dynamic coordination for heterogeneous robot teams using high-level instructions.

Method: Proposes a three-stage framework involving LLMs for instruction parsing, classical planners for optimization, and behavior trees for reactive control; also introduces the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset.

Result: H-AIM significantly outperformed the strongest baseline (LaMMA-P), achieving a task success rate of 55% and goal condition recall of 72%.

Conclusion: H-AIM provides an effective framework for heterogeneous robot coordination, improving task execution and demonstrating the potential for enhanced embodied AI systems.

Abstract: In embodied artificial intelligence, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to execute long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions remains a critical challenge. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that H-AIM achieves a remarkable performance improvement, elevating the task success rate from 12% to 55% and boosting the goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the strongest baseline, LaMMA-P.

TL;DR: This paper introduces A3D, a dual-arm robotic framework for furniture assembly, focusing on adaptive affordances for support and stabilization based on dense geometric representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Furniture assembly is complex for robots due to the need for precise coordination between arms and generalization across diverse geometries. This research aims to improve robots' adaptability and efficiency in assembly tasks.

Method: The method leverages adaptive affordances supported by dense point-level geometric representations to determine optimal support and stabilization locations. An adaptive module adjusts support strategies dynamically based on feedback from assembly interactions.

Result: The framework shows effective generalization to different part geometries and furniture types, validated through experiments in both simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: A3D enhances dual-arm robotic assembly performance, demonstrating adaptability and generalization capabilities, fostering further advancement in autonomous furniture assembly tasks.

Abstract: Furniture assembly is a crucial yet challenging task for robots, requiring precise dual-arm coordination where one arm manipulates parts while the other provides collaborative support and stabilization. To accomplish this task more effectively, robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process, while also generalizing across diverse part geometries. We propose A3D, a framework which learns adaptive affordances to identify optimal support and stabilization locations on furniture parts. The method employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns, enabling generalization across varied geometries. To handle evolving assembly states, we introduce an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions. We establish a simulation environment featuring 50 diverse parts across 8 furniture types, designed for dual-arm collaboration evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generalizes effectively to diverse part geometries and furniture categories in both simulation and real-world settings.

Motivation: Improve robustness of marker-based landing systems in complex urban settings where ideal conditions are not assured.

Method: Simulation-based evaluation suite on AirSim, with varied urban layouts, lighting, and weather; onboard camera sensors used for marker detection and obstacle avoidance; heuristic and RL agent strategies benchmarked.

Result: Systematic results show how exploration strategies and complex urban environments impact success rates, efficiency, and robustness.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of testing drone landing systems under diverse, realistic conditions for better reliability in urban environments.

Abstract: Marker-based landing is widely used in drone delivery and return-to-base systems for its simplicity and reliability. However, most approaches assume idealized landing site visibility and sensor performance, limiting robustness in complex urban settings. We present a simulation-based evaluation suite on the AirSim platform with systematically varied urban layouts, lighting, and weather to replicate realistic operational diversity. Using onboard camera sensors (RGB for marker detection and depth for obstacle avoidance), we benchmark two heuristic coverage patterns and a reinforcement learning-based agent, analyzing how exploration strategy and scene complexity affect success rate, path efficiency, and robustness. Results underscore the need to evaluate marker-based autonomous landing under diverse, sensor-relevant conditions to guide the development of reliable aerial navigation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of sim-to-real transfer in hydraulic robots caused by slow control response and complex fluid dynamics, which makes detailed simulation impractical for reinforcement learning.

Method: An analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics is proposed, capable of predicting joint torques for 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, facilitating efficient reinforcement learning.

Result: The model outperforms neural network-based actuator models in data-limited scenarios. It enables stable locomotion policy development on a 300 kg hydraulic quadruped robot via reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The research successfully achieves a stable and robust sim-to-real transfer of RL-based locomotion policies on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, setting a milestone in robotics innovation.

Abstract: The simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer of large-scale hydraulic robots presents a significant challenge in robotics because of the inherent slow control response and complex fluid dynamics. The complex dynamics result from the multiple interconnected cylinder structure and the difference in fluid rates of the cylinders. These characteristics complicate detailed simulation for all joints, making it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent the complicated actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, allowing rapid processing in RL environments. We compare our model with neural network-based actuator models and demonstrate the advantages of our model in data-limited scenarios. The locomotion policy trained in RL with our model is deployed on a hydraulic quadruped robot, which is over 300 kg. This work is the first demonstration of a successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses wildfire monitoring using a mobile agent by integrating sensing, estimation, and control into a stochastic optimal control framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in wildfire monitoring caused by the stochastic nature of fire spread and limitations in current methods that often lack optimality guarantees or rely on heuristics.

Method: The study formulates wildfire front monitoring as a stochastic optimal control problem, creating a recursive Bayesian estimator for nonlinear fire models and transforming the problem into a Markov decision process with a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search for control policies.

Result: The proposed framework integrates sensing, estimation, and control, offering a structured way to monitor wildfire fronts with improved accuracy and adaptability.

Conclusion: This approach combines theoretical innovations in stochastic control and practical tools for wildfire monitoring, paving the way for more efficient and optimal data-guided fire tracking solutions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptively monitoring a wildfire front using a mobile agent (e.g., a drone), whose trajectory determines where sensor data is collected and thus influences the accuracy of fire propagation estimation. This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. Subsequently, we transform the resulting nonlinear stochastic control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process and design an information-seeking predictive control law obtained via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.

Motivation: To overcome challenges of fragmented interfaces and communication latency in Vision-Language-Action model deployment, particularly in robotics.

Method: Developed VLAgents, a modular server providing a unified Gymnasium-style protocol with adaptive communication layers supporting shared memory and compressed streaming.

Result: Demonstrated integration of seven policies, surpassing performance benchmarks of other standard policy servers for both local and remote communication.

Conclusion: VLAgents streamlines VLA model deployment with its flexible architecture, achieving superior performance over traditional setups.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) has a significant impact on robotics. However, their deployment remains complex due to the fragmented interfaces and the inherent communication latency in distributed setups. To address this, we introduce VLAgents, a modular policy server that abstracts VLA inferencing behind a unified Gymnasium-style protocol. Crucially, its communication layer transparently adapts to the context by supporting both zero-copy shared memory for high-speed simulation and compressed streaming for remote hardware. In this work, we present the architecture of VLAgents and validate it by integrating seven policies -- including OpenVLA and Pi Zero. In a benchmark with both local and remote communication, we further demonstrate how it outperforms the default policy servers provided by OpenVLA, OpenPi, and LeRobot.

TL;DR: The paper presents SADiff, a framework that enhances robotic manipulation generalization by incorporating skill-level data and introducing the IsaacSkill dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle to flexibly adapt to diverse environments due to insufficient utilization of skill-level information in manipulation tasks.

Method: The SADiff framework utilizes a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens and a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flows. It further refines 2D motion flow into 3D actions using a skill-retrieval strategy.

Result: SADiff demonstrates strong performance and generalization in both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Skill-level information is critical for improving generalization in robotic manipulation, and the proposed SADiff method with the IsaacSkill dataset addresses this effectively.

Abstract: Robust generalization in robotic manipulation is crucial for robots to adapt flexibly to diverse environments. Existing methods usually improve generalization by scaling data and networks, but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information. Observing that tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns, we propose Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff), which explicitly incorporates skill-level information to improve generalization. SADiff learns skill-specific representations through a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, and conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow. A skill-retrieval transformation strategy further exploits skill-specific trajectory priors to refine the mapping from 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions. Furthermore, we introduce IsaacSkill, a high-fidelity dataset containing fundamental robotic skills for comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a safety control filter using control barrier functions (CBF) for heterogeneous and uncooperative uncrewed vessel fleets to ensure collision avoidance, combining it with COLREGS rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collision avoidance in fleets of diverse autonomous systems is challenging due to different decision processes and controllers, compounded by limited real-time trajectory sharing.

Method: A distributed safety control filter based on control barrier function (CBF) theory, integrating worst-case behavior modeling, is developed and compared with COLREGS behavior. Simulations and real-world trials were conducted.

Result: The CBF method, combined with COLREGS behaviors, demonstrated improved safety and efficiency in both simulations and experiments with various vessels, including human-operated ones.

Conclusion: Combining CBF theory with COLREGS behaviors is effective for robust and efficient collision avoidance across heterogeneous uncrewed vessel platforms.

Abstract: Collision avoidance in heterogeneous fleets of uncrewed vessels is challenging because the decision-making processes and controllers often differ between platforms, and it is further complicated by the limitations on sharing trajectories and control values in real-time. This paper presents a pragmatic approach that addresses these issues by adding a control filter on each autonomous vehicle that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts, including crewed vessels. This distributed safety control filter is developed using control barrier function (CBF) theory and the application is clearly described to ensure explainability of these safety-critical methods. This work compares the worst-case CBF approach with a Collision Regulations (COLREGS) behavior-based approach in simulated encounters. Real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human operated vessel were performed to confirm the approach is effective across a range of platforms and is robust to uncooperative behavior from human operators. Results show that combining both CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors achieves the best safety and efficiency.

*Linqing Zhong,Yi Liu,Yifei Wei,Ziyu Xiong,Maoqing Yao,Si Liu,Guanghui Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a reasoning approach for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that structures the reasoning process directly in the action space for robotic manipulation tasks. It achieves superior performance on benchmarks like LIBERO and VLABench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reasoning capabilities of VLA models for diverse manipulation tasks by directly deliberating in the action space, rather than using indirect methods like sub-task prediction or goal image synthesis.

Method: The authors propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture incorporating two components: (1) Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) for providing coarse reference trajectories and (2) Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR) to extract latent action priors. These components work together to condition a policy for grounded action execution.

Result: The ACoT-VLA model achieves state-of-the-art results in robotic manipulation benchmarks: 98.5% on LIBERO, 84.1% on LIBERO-Plus, and 47.4% on VLABench.

Conclusion: ACoT-VLA establishes itself as an effective method for precise and grounded reasoning in action spaces, advancing robotic policy learning and improving manipulation task performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.

Result: The GM-100 tasks were proven feasible and effective in distinguishing capabilities of current robot learning models.

Conclusion: GM-100 can significantly advance robot learning, offering a standardized evaluation platform and promoting diversity in task designs.

Abstract: Recently, with the rapid development of robot learning and imitation learning, numerous datasets and methods have emerged. However, these datasets and their task designs often lack systematic consideration and principles. This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic-geometric task graph representation for learning long-horizon bimanual manipulation behaviors from human demonstrations, using a Message Passing Neural Network encoder and Transformer-based decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of capturing discrete task semantics and temporal object-centric geometric relations for effective reasoning over task progression in bimanual manipulation.

Method: The proposed method involves encoding object identities, inter-object relations, and temporal evolution into a semantic-geometric task graph, using a Message Passing Neural Network encoder and a Transformer-based decoder to predict future action sequences and object motions.

Result: Semantic-geometric task graphs proved effective in modeling tasks with high action and object variability, outperforming simpler sequence-based models in reasoning over task progression.

Conclusion: The representation serves as reusable task abstractions that can be transferred to physical robots for online decision-making, showcasing their practical utility in manipulation systems.

Abstract: Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.

TL;DR: LogicLens is a conversational agent that aids developers in understanding complex, multi-repository software systems through the use of a semantic graph combining syntactic and semantic code analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face challenges in understanding large software systems due to their distributed nature and implicit domain logic scattered across repositories and microservices.

Method: The paper introduces a preprocessing approach that combines syntactic code analysis (using AST parsing and repository traversal) with semantic enrichment via Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a semantic multi-repository graph. Developers interact with this graph through natural language.

Result: LogicLens demonstrates capabilities such as impact analysis, symptom-based debugging, and dynamic query resolution, evaluated on real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The semantic graph and conversational interface provide a novel way for developers to explore and understand complex software systems effectively.

Abstract: Understanding large software systems is a challenging task, especially when code is distributed across multiple repositories and microservices. Developers often need to reason not only about the structure of the code, but also about its domain logic and runtime behaviors, which are typically implicit and scattered. We introduce LogicLens, a reactive conversational agent that assists developers in exploring complex software systems through a semantic multi-repository graph. This graph is built in a preprocessing step by combining syntactic code analysis, via AST parsing and repository traversal, with semantic enrichment using Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting graph captures both structural elements, such as files, classes, and functions, as well as functional abstractions like domain entities, operations, and workflows. Once the graph is constructed, LogicLens enables developers to interact with it via natural language, dynamically retrieving relevant subgraphs and answering technical or functional queries. We present the architecture of the system, discuss emergent behaviors, and evaluate its effectiveness on real-world multi-repository scenarios. We demonstrate emergent capabilities including impact analysis and symptom-based debugging that arise naturally from the semantic graph structure.

Motivation: To address the risks scientific debt poses to the validity and reproducibility of scientific software outputs.

Method: A multi-artifact analysis was performed across 23 open-source scientific software projects, coupled with classifier development and practitioner validation.

Result: The classifier successfully analyzed 900,358 artifacts, revealing that scientific debt is prevalent in pull requests and issue trackers. It highlighted gaps in traditional SATD detection.

Conclusion: Scientific debt, a distinct form of SATD, calls for specialized tools and methods for better management in scientific software development.

Abstract: Context: Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) occurs when developers acknowledge shortcuts in code. In scientific software (SSW), such debt poses unique risks to the validity and reproducibility of results. Objective: This study aims to identify, categorize, and evaluate scientific debt, a specialized form of SATD in SSW, and assess the extent to which traditional SATD categories capture these domain-specific issues. Method: We conduct a multi-artifact analysis across code comments, commit messages, pull requests, and issue trackers from 23 open-source SSW projects. We construct and validate a curated dataset of scientific debt, develop a multi-source SATD classifier, and conduct a practitioner validation to assess the practical relevance of scientific debt. Results: Our classifier performs strongly across 900,358 artifacts from 23 SSW projects. SATD is most prevalent in pull requests and issue trackers, underscoring the value of multi-artifact analysis. Models trained on traditional SATD often miss scientific debt, emphasizing the need for its explicit detection in SSW. Practitioner validation confirmed that scientific debt is both recognizable and useful in practice. Conclusions: Scientific debt represents a unique form of SATD in SSW that that is not adequately captured by traditional categories and requires specialized identification and management. Our dataset, classification analysis, and practitioner validation results provide the first formal multi-artifact perspective on scientific debt, highlighting the need for tailored SATD detection approaches in SSW.

Motivation: To shed light on the invisible barriers to networking in global software engineering research and advocate for fairer opportunities.

Method: The study uses reflection, literature review, and personal experiences to examine inequalities in professional networks.

Result: Identified barriers such as country, immigration status, language, gender, and cultural context affecting networking chances.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for a community-driven 'expert voice' initiative to mitigate networking inequities.

Abstract: Networking is central to the growth and visibility of software engineering research and researchers. However, opportunities and capacities to build such networks are not easily identified and often are unevenly distributed. While networking is often viewed as an individual skill, a researchers workplace, culture and environment significantly influence their motivation and, consequently, the networks they form. This paper explores how factors such as country of residence, immigration status, language, gender, and surrounding context affect researchers' ability to establish professional connections and succeed within the global research ecosystem. Drawing on existing literature and personal experience, this reflective report examines the often-invisible barriers to networking and advocates for a community-driven "expert voice" initiative to acknowledge and address these inequities.

Motivation: Developers frequently modify code via PRs, often leading to untested lines even with extensive testing, creating quality risks. This paper aims to address this testing gap.

Method: ChaCo uses an LLM-based approach to augment tests for PR-specific lines. It integrates relevant test contexts and ensures seamless integration into the existing test suite.

Result: The evaluation on 145 PRs from SciPy, Qiskit, and Pandas shows ChaCo achieves full patch coverage for 30% of PRs at a low cost ($0.11), with high reviewer approval and practical effectiveness, revealing bugs and merging tests.

Conclusion: ChaCo proves promising as a CI workflow integration to automate patch-specific regression testing augmentation and improve software quality.

Abstract: Software is in constant evolution, with developers frequently submitting pull requests (PRs) to introduce new features or fix bugs. Testing PRs is critical to maintaining software quality. Yet, even in projects with extensive test suites, some PR-modified lines remain untested, leaving a "last-mile" regression test gap. Existing test generators typically aim to improve overall coverage, but do not specifically target the uncovered lines in PRs. We present Change And Cover (ChaCo), an LLM-based test augmentation technique that addresses this gap. It makes three contributions: (i) ChaCo considers the PR-specific patch coverage, offering developers augmented tests for code just when it is on the developers' mind. (ii) We identify providing suitable test context as a crucial challenge for an LLM to generate useful tests, and present two techniques to extract relevant test content, such as existing test functions, fixtures, and data generators. (iii) To make augmented tests acceptable for developers, ChaCo carefully integrates them into the existing test suite, e.g., by matching the test's structure and style with the existing tests, and generates a summary of the test addition for developer review. We evaluate ChaCo on 145 PRs from three popular and complex open-source projects - SciPy, Qiskit, and Pandas. The approach successfully helps 30% of PRs achieve full patch coverage, at the cost of $0.11, showing its effectiveness and practicality. Human reviewers find the tests to be worth adding (4.53/5.0), well integrated (4.2/5.0), and relevant to the PR (4.7/5.0). Ablations show test context is crucial for context-aware test generation, leading to 2x coverage. We submitted 12 tests, of which 8 have already been merged, and two previously unknown bugs were exposed and fixed. We envision our approach to be integrated into CI workflows, automating the last mile of regression test augmentation.

### [227] [ABC-Bench: Benchmarking Agentic Backend Coding in Real-World Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11077)
*Jie Yang,Honglin Guo,Li Ji,Jiazheng Zhou,Rui Zheng,Zhikai Lei,Shuo Zhang,Zhiheng Xi,Shichun Liu,Yuxin Wang,Bo Wang,Yining Zheng,Tao Gui,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ABC-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in dynamic, end-to-end backend coding scenarios, revealing performance gaps in current state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on static code evaluation, failing to address the dynamic and holistic demands of backend software engineering like environment setup and API deployment.

Method: The authors created ABC-Bench, featuring 224 tasks from real-world repositories, requiring LLMs to complete entire workflows, including containerized service deployment and passing API tests.

Result: The evaluation shows significant performance struggles of current LLMs in handling the whole engineering lifecycle tasks demanded by ABC-Bench.

Conclusion: LLMs currently fall short in meeting the challenges of practical backend engineering, emphasizing the need for further advancements to bridge the capability gap.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has expanded the scope of AI coding from localized code generation to complex, repository-level, and execution-driven problem solving. However, current benchmarks predominantly evaluate code logic in static contexts, neglecting the dynamic, full-process requirements of real-world engineering, particularly in backend development which demands rigorous environment configuration and service deployment. To address this gap, we introduce ABC-Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate agentic backend coding within a realistic, executable workflow. Using a scalable automated pipeline, we curated 224 practical tasks spanning 8 languages and 19 frameworks from open-source repositories. Distinct from previous evaluations, ABC-Bench require the agents to manage the entire development lifecycle from repository exploration to instantiating containerized services and pass the external end-to-end API tests. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to deliver reliable performance on these holistic tasks, highlighting a substantial disparity between current model capabilities and the demands of practical backend engineering. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMOSS/ABC-Bench.

*Matteo Vaccargiu,Riccardo Lai,Maria Ilaria Lunesu,Andrea Pinna,Giuseppe Destefanis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of bots in Ethereum open-source discussions, revealing their influence on human emotional tone shifts and timing of participation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the impact of bots on open-source development collaborations, particularly how they affect the emotional tone and communication patterns of human developers.

Method: The authors analyzed data from 36,875 accounts across ten Ethereum repositories, identifying bot participation and comparing it to human interaction patterns. They trained a model with 27 emotion categories to evaluate emotional tone.

Result: Bots were found to participate differently: uniformly in pull requests and in late-stage issues. Their presence correlates with reduced neutrality and shifts in humans towards emotions like gratitude, admiration, and optimism.

Conclusion: Despite being few in number, bots significantly influence the timing and emotional dynamics of human interactions in Ethereum open-source projects.

Abstract: We study how bots contribute to open-source discussions in the Ethereum ecosystem and whether they influence developers' emotional tone. Our dataset covers 36,875 accounts across ten repositories with 105 validated bots (0.28%). Human participation follows a U-shaped pattern, while bots engage in uniform (pull requests) or late-stage (issues) activity. Bots respond faster than humans in pull requests but play slower maintenance roles in issues. Using a model trained on 27 emotion categories, we find bots are more neutral, yet their interventions are followed by reduced neutrality in human comments, with shifts toward gratitude, admiration, and optimism and away from confusion. These findings indicate that even a small number of bots are associated with changes in both timing and emotional dynamics of developer communication.

### [229] [Automation and Reuse Practices in GitHub Actions Workflows: A Practitioner's Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11299)
*Hassan Onsori Delicheh,Guillaume Cardoen,Alexandre Decan,Tom Mens*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study surveyed 419 practitioners to understand automation and reuse practices in GitHub Actions workflows, highlighting challenges and areas for improvement such as better tooling and discovery of components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workflow maintenance in GitHub Actions is burdensome for developers due to difficulties in writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining workflows, necessitating research into automation and reuse practices.

Method: The study surveyed 419 practitioners to gather insights on their automation tasks, workflow creation mechanisms, and preferences for reusable Actions and workflows.

Result: Core CI/CD tasks are the primary focus of automation; less attention is given to security and performance monitoring. Reusable Actions are widely adopted, but reusable workflows are less common due to challenges like Action versioning and maintenance.

Conclusion: Improved tooling, better automation task support, and enhanced mechanisms for managing and trusting reusable components are needed to aid workflow users.

Abstract: GitHub natively supports workflow automation through GitHub Actions. Yet, workflow maintenance is often considered a burden for software developers, who frequently face difficulties in writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining workflows. Little knowledge exists concerning the automation and reuse practices favoured by workflow practitioners. We therefore surveyed 419 practitioners to elucidate good and bad workflow development practices and to identify opportunities for supporting workflow maintenance. Specifically, we investigate the tasks that practitioners tend to automate using GitHub Actions, their preferred workflow creation mechanisms, and the non-functional characteristics they prioritise. We also examine the practices and challenges associated with GitHub's workflow reuse mechanisms. We observe a tendency to focus automation efforts on core CI/CD tasks, with less emphasis on crucial areas like security analysis and performance monitoring. Practitioners strongly rely on reusable Actions, but reusable workflows see less frequent adoption. Furthermore, we observed challenges with Action versioning and maintenance. Copy-pasting remains a common practice to have more control and avoid the complexity of depending on reusable components. These insights suggest the need for improved tooling, enhanced support for a wide range of automation tasks, and better mechanisms for discovering, managing, and trusting reusable workflow components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online user feedback is valuable for requirements engineering, but its volume and noise make analysis challenging, and existing tools are often fragmented in their support.

Method: The paper develops RITA, an integration of lightweight open-source large language models into an end-to-end workflow for automating tasks such as classification, identification, and requirements specifications directly from feedback.

Result: RITA demonstrates efficient conversion of raw feedback into actionable requirements artefacts by leveraging previously validated techniques and integrating seamlessly with tools like Jira.

Conclusion: RITA helps bridge the gap between research and real-world requirements engineering practices, making user feedback analysis more streamlined and effective.

Abstract: Context and motivation. Online user feedback is a valuable resource for requirements engineering, but its volume and noise make analysis difficult. Existing tools support individual feedback analysis tasks, but their capabilities are rarely integrated into end-to-end support. Problem. The lack of end-to-end integration limits the practical adoption of existing RE tools and makes it difficult to assess their real-world usefulness. Solution. To address this challenge, we present RITA, a tool that integrates lightweight open-source large language models into a unified workflow for feedback-driven RE. RITA supports automated request classification, non-functional requirement identification, and natural-language requirements specification generation from online feedback via a user-friendly interface, and integrates with Jira for seamless transfer of requirements specifications to development tools. Results and conclusions. RITA exploits previously evaluated LLM-based RE techniques to efficiently transform raw user feedback into requirements artefacts, helping bridge the gap between research and practice.

TL;DR: The paper discusses technical debt management within teams, offering practical guidance based on collaborative research with three corporate teams, emphasizing customizable practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to translate scientific findings into actionable guidance for managing technical debt tailored to team-specific needs.

Method: The author collaborated with three teams across companies to develop a tailored technical debt management system, based on practical implementation and discarding less applicable research findings.

Result: The output is a flexible guide that differentiates between "best practices" adopted by all teams and "nice-to-haves" adopted by at least one team.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by offering a team-oriented flexible framework for managing technical debt while also suggesting approaches for company-wide implementation.

Abstract: This white paper provides an overview of the topic of "technical debt" and presents an approach for managing technical debt in teams. The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.

### [232] [Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10912)
*Samuel D. Anderson,Nikhil N. Chaudhari,Nahian F. Chowdhury,Jordan Jomsky,Andrei Irimia,Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph neural network (GNN)-based method to estimate local brain age (LBA) from brain MRIs, identifying specific regions and features involved in brain aging and their link to cognitive decline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focused on global brain age (GBA) but lacked a framework for estimating local brain age (LBA) using cortical morphology, which is vital for understanding spatially localized patterns of brain aging.

Method: The authors used a GNN trained on morphometric features from cortical surface meshes of 14,250 MRI scans. They applied the model to identify aging patterns and compared contributions of different cortical features using integrated gradients.

Result: The GNN revealed the prefrontal and parietal regions as early aging sites and linked morphological aging to specific cortical features. It also detected excessive morphological aging in temporal structures in Alzheimer's patients, correlating LBA gaps with cognitive impairments.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN framework provides high-resolution insights into local brain aging and its relationship with cognitive decline, enhancing the understanding of the aging process.

Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: KOCOBrain is a graph neural network framework designed to predict prenatal drug exposure effects on brain development using phase dynamics and cognitive-aware modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying neural signatures of prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances like cannabis and understanding their impact on brain networks and neurodevelopment.

Method: Developed KOCOBrain, a graph neural network integrating structural and functional connectomes using Kuramoto dynamics and cognitive-aware mechanisms, applied to the ABCD cohort.

Result: KOCOBrain achieved improved predictions of prenatal drug exposure compared to baselines and unveiled interpretable disrupted coordination in brain networks caused by exposure.

Conclusion: KOCOBrain provides a robust tool for analyzing the neural effects of prenatal substance exposure, enhancing prediction performance and insight into disrupted brain functions.

Abstract: Exposure to psychoactive substances during pregnancy, such as cannabis, can disrupt neurodevelopment and alter large-scale brain networks, yet identifying their neural signatures remains challenging. We introduced KOCOBrain: KuramotO COupled Brain Graph Network; a unified graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional connectomes via Kuramoto-based phase dynamics and cognition-aware attention. The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario. Applied to the ABCD cohort, KOCOBrain improved prenatal drug exposure prediction over relevant baselines and revealed interpretable structure-function patterns that reflect disrupted brain network coordination associated with early exposure.

TL;DR: The paper decodes visual information from primates' intracortical recordings using a novel model, achieving high accuracy with temporal dynamics modeling and proposing a generative pipeline for image reconstruction from brain activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural activity leads to perception by decoding visual information using intracortical recordings in primates.

Method: Evaluate model architectures, training objectives, and dataset scaling on decoding performance. Use a modular generative decoding pipeline integrating temporal attention and a shallow MLP.

Result: Achieved up to 70% image retrieval accuracy. Highlighted diminishing returns with increased dataset size and dimensionality and proposed a generative framework for reconstructing images from brain activity.

Conclusion: Temporal dynamics are key to decoding visual information, and the proposed generative pipeline provides principles for advancing brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding systems.

Abstract: Understanding how neural activity gives rise to perception is a central challenge in neuroscience. We address the problem of decoding visual information from high-density intracortical recordings in primates, using the THINGS Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset. We systematically evaluate the effects of model architecture, training objectives, and data scaling on decoding performance. Results show that decoding accuracy is mainly driven by modeling temporal dynamics in neural signals, rather than architectural complexity. A simple model combining temporal attention with a shallow MLP achieves up to 70% top-1 image retrieval accuracy, outperforming linear baselines as well as recurrent and convolutional approaches. Scaling analyses reveal predictable diminishing returns with increasing input dimensionality and dataset size. Building on these findings, we design a modular generative decoding pipeline that combines low-resolution latent reconstruction with semantically conditioned diffusion, generating plausible images from 200 ms of brain activity. This framework provides principles for brain-computer interfaces and semantic neural decoding.

### [235] [Mass Distribution versus Density Distribution in the Context of Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10759)
*Kai Ming Ting,Ye Zhu,Hang Zhang,Tianrun Liang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper highlights the limitations of density-based clustering due to high-density bias and proposes a new method, mass-maximization clustering (MMC), utilizing mass distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the biases inherent in density-based clustering, which hinder discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes, and densities.

Method: The authors introduce a mass-maximization clustering (MMC) algorithm that maximizes total cluster mass rather than focusing on density.

Result: The MMC avoids bias towards dense clusters and can be adjusted to compare density and mass distributions.

Conclusion: Mass distribution is a more effective data descriptor for clustering compared to density distribution, as it mitigates high-density bias and enhances the discovery of diverse cluster types.

Abstract: This paper investigates two fundamental descriptors of data, i.e., density distribution versus mass distribution, in the context of clustering. Density distribution has been the de facto descriptor of data distribution since the introduction of statistics. We show that density distribution has its fundamental limitation -- high-density bias, irrespective of the algorithms used to perform clustering. Existing density-based clustering algorithms have employed different algorithmic means to counter the effect of the high-density bias with some success, but the fundamental limitation of using density distribution remains an obstacle to discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities. Using the mass distribution as a better foundation, we propose a new algorithm which maximizes the total mass of all clusters, called mass-maximization clustering (MMC). The algorithm can be easily changed to maximize the total density of all clusters in order to examine the fundamental limitation of using density distribution versus mass distribution. The key advantage of the MMC over the density-maximization clustering is that the maximization is conducted without a bias towards dense clusters.

*Minseo Kang,Seunghwan Park,Dongha Kim*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: IMBoost framework addresses challenges of unsupervised outlier detection by combining active learning with reinforcement of inlier-memorization effect, improving detection accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve unsupervised outlier detection, especially when inliers are not well-separated or outliers form dense clusters, by leveraging and reinforcing the inlier-memorization effect.

Method: IMBoost operates in two stages: a warm-up phase emphasizing inlier-memorization and a polarization phase utilizing active learning with a novel query strategy and custom loss function to increase discrepancy in scores between inliers and outliers.

Result: IMBoost consistently separates inlier and outlier scores, achieving superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art active outlier detection methods while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: IMBoost proves to be effective in overcoming existing limitations in unsupervised OD, offering robust performance with fewer computational resources.

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) aims to identify abnormal instances, known as outliers or anomalies, by learning typical patterns of normal data, or inliers. Performing OD under an unsupervised regime-without any information about anomalous instances in the training data-is challenging. A recently observed phenomenon, known as the inlier-memorization (IM) effect, where deep generative models (DGMs) tend to memorize inlier patterns during early training, provides a promising signal for distinguishing outliers. However, existing unsupervised approaches that rely solely on the IM effect still struggle when inliers and outliers are not well-separated or when outliers form dense clusters. To address these limitations, we incorporate active learning to selectively acquire informative labels, and propose IMBoost, a novel framework that explicitly reinforces the IM effect to improve outlier detection. Our method consists of two stages: 1) a warm-up phase that induces and promotes the IM effect, and 2) a polarization phase in which actively queried samples are used to maximize the discrepancy between inlier and outlier scores. In particular, we propose a novel query strategy and tailored loss function in the polarization phase to effectively identify informative samples and fully leverage the limited labeling budget. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the IMBoost consistently decreases inlier risk while increasing outlier risk throughout training, thereby amplifying their separation. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that IMBoost not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art active OD methods but also requires substantially less computational cost.

*Fenglin Zhang,Jie Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a contextual distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework using causal Sinkhorn discrepancy and efficient solving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address robustness in data-driven decision-making while considering causal and covariate structures of distributions.

Method: Developed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO) using causal Sinkhorn discrepancy and introduced Soft Regression Forest as a decision rule with a gradient-based solution methodology.

Result: The framework demonstrated superior performance and interpretability over existing methods in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances robustness, causal interpretability, and computational efficiency in decision-making.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a framework for contextual distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that considers the causal and continuous structure of the underlying distribution by developing interpretable and tractable decision rules that prescribe decisions using covariates. We first introduce the causal Sinkhorn discrepancy (CSD), an entropy-regularized causal Wasserstein distance that encourages continuous transport plans while preserving the causal consistency. We then formulate a contextual DRO model with a CSD-based ambiguity set, termed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO), and derive its strong dual reformulation where the worst-case distribution is characterized as a mixture of Gibbs distributions. To solve the corresponding infinite-dimensional policy optimization, we propose the Soft Regression Forest (SRF) decision rule, which approximates optimal policies within arbitrary measurable function spaces. The SRF preserves the interpretability of classical decision trees while being fully parametric, differentiable, and Lipschitz smooth, enabling intrinsic interpretation from both global and local perspectives. To solve the Causal-SDRO with parametric decision rules, we develop an efficient stochastic compositional gradient algorithm that converges to an $\varepsilon$-stationary point at a rate of $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$, matching the convergence rate of standard stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we validate our method through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and interpretability.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a distributed framework for analyzing high-dimensional, large-scale heterogeneous matrix-variate time series data, utilizing a factor model to improve efficiency and data utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of analyzing high-dimensional, large-scale heterogenous matrix-variate time series data, especially issues like computational inefficiency and incomplete utilization of latent matrix structures in existing methods.

Method: The framework partitions the matrix-variate data column-wise or row-wise, conducts local analysis via tensor PCA on distributed servers, aggregates estimates at a central server, and performs a final PCA step for global estimation. It also incorporates clustering approaches and extends to unit-root nonstationary data with derived asymptotic properties.

Result: Simulation studies demonstrate enhanced computational efficiency and estimation accuracy of the proposed framework. Applications on real data validate the predictive performance in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively preserves latent matrix structures, boosts computational efficiency, improves information utilization, and offers robust analysis methods for both stationary and nonstationary matrix-variate time series.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional, large-scale, heterogeneous matrix-variate time series data using a factor model. The data are first partitioned column-wise (or row-wise) and allocated to node servers, where each node estimates the row (or column) loading matrix via two-dimensional tensor PCA. These local estimates are then transmitted to a central server and aggregated, followed by a final PCA step to obtain the global row (or column) loading matrix estimator. Given the estimated loading matrices, the corresponding factor matrices are subsequently computed. Unlike existing distributed approaches, our framework preserves the latent matrix structure, thereby improving computational efficiency and enhancing information utilization. We also discuss row- and column-wise clustering procedures for settings in which the group memberships are unknown. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to unit-root nonstationary matrix-variate time series. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are derived for the diverging dimension of the data in each computing unit and the sample size $T$. Simulation results assess the computational efficiency and estimation accuracy of the proposed framework, and real data applications further validate its predictive performance.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study evaluates how airtime division impacts a gesture recognition system using an mmWave ISAC system, showing minimal sensing performance loss even at reduced airtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored effects of airtime division between sensing and communication modes in ISAC systems on sensing performance.

Method: Utilized a dataset of power measurements from mmWave devices performing beam sweeps during gestures. Trained a gesture classifier with Convolutional Neural Networks and simulated reduced sensing airtime by subsampling measurements.

Result: Findings demonstrate that at a sensing airtime of 25%, classification accuracy only decreased by 0.15 percentage points compared to full-time sensing.

Conclusion: mmWave ISAC systems can maintain high sensing quality with reduced airtime, making them well-suited for applications requiring both sensing and high data throughput, such as wireless Extended Reality.

Abstract: Most Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems require dividing airtime across their two modes. However, the specific impact of this decision on sensing performance remains unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we therefore investigate the impact on a gesture recognition system using a Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) ISAC system. With our dataset of power per beam pair gathered with two mmWave devices performing constant beam sweeps while test subjects performed distinct gestures, we train a gesture classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. We then subsample these measurements, emulating reduced sensing airtime, showing that a sensing airtime of 25 % only reduces classification accuracy by 0.15 percentage points from full-time sensing. Alongside this high-quality sensing at low airtime, mmWave systems are known to provide extremely high data throughputs, making mmWave ISAC a prime enabler for applications such as truly wireless Extended Reality.

Motivation: Address challenges in topology optimization caused by the non-differentiability of binary manufacturable structures during topology changes.

Method: Develop SSP2, a second-order version of subpixel-smoothed projection, by regularizing the SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field for better differentiability and optimization performance.

Result: SSP2 shows faster convergence in connectivity-dominant cases and enables the use of advanced optimization algorithms like interior-point methods, while being easily integrable into current systems.

Conclusion: SSP2 improves gradient-based topology optimization by addressing differentiability issues, offering better convergence guarantees, and supporting a broader range of optimization algorithms.

Abstract: A key challenge in topology optimization (TopOpt) is that manufacturable structures, being inherently binary, are non-differentiable, creating a fundamental tension with gradient-based optimization. The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.

### [242] [SSC-UNet: UNet with Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Phonocardiography Noise Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10735)
*Lizy Abraham,Siobhan Coughlan,Kritika Rajain,Changhong Li,Saji Philip,Adam James*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study introduces a self-supervised noise reduction model for phonocardiography based on Noise2Noise, achieving significant noise reduction and improved classification sensitivity without relying on clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of noise reduction in phonocardiography for effective congenital heart disease (CHD) diagnosis, especially when clean data is limited.

Method: A self-supervised noise reduction model using the Noise2Noise framework is proposed, enhanced with data augmentation and contrastive learning for better performance in noisy environments.

Result: The model achieved an average SNR of 12.98 dB under hospital noise conditions and improved CHD classification sensitivity from 27% to 88% after noise filtering.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates strong capabilities in noise reduction and pathological feature retention, showcasing its applicability in practical, noisy medical settings.

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) remains a significant global health concern affecting approximately 1\% of births worldwide. Phonocardiography has emerged as a supplementary tool to diagnose CHD cost-effectively. However, the performance of these diagnostic models highly depends on the quality of the phonocardiography, thus, noise reduction is particularly critical. Supervised UNet effectively improves noise reduction capabilities, but limited clean data hinders its application. The complex time-frequency characteristics of phonocardiography further complicate finding the balance between effectively removing noise and preserving pathological features. In this study, we proposed a self-supervised phonocardiography noise reduction model based on Noise2Noise to enable training without clean data. Augmentation and contrastive learning are applied to enhance its performance. We obtained an average SNR of 12.98 dB after filtering under 10~dB of hospital noise. Classification sensitivity after filtering was improved from 27\% to 88\%, indicating its promising pathological feature retention capabilities in practical noisy environments.

*Ayesh Abu Lehyeh,Anastassia Gharib,Tian Xia,Dryver Huston,Safwan Wshah*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study proposes UBiGTLoc, a novel BiLSTM-Graph Transformer Localization framework, to enhance sensor node localization in IoT networks without the reliance on anchor nodes and under challenging conditions like RSSI fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization accuracy in IoT sensor networks is often compromised due to dependency on anchor nodes and unreliable RSSI data, especially in difficult conditions like NLOS scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces UBiGTLoc, a framework that integrates BiLSTM to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and uses Graph Transformers to model spatial relationships in both anchor-free and anchor-presence scenarios.

Result: Simulations validate that UBiGTLoc outperforms existing localization methods, achieving robust accuracy across both dense and sparse sensor networks while relying solely on inexpensive RSSI data.

Conclusion: UBiGTLoc effectively addresses localization challenges in IoT sensor networks, providing a cost-efficient and accurate solution for various deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Sensor nodes localization in wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks is crucial for the effective operation of diverse applications, such as smart cities and smart agriculture. Existing sensor nodes localization approaches heavily rely on anchor nodes within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Anchor nodes are sensor nodes equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers and thus, have known locations. These anchor nodes operate as references to localize other sensor nodes. However, the presence of anchor nodes may not always be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Additionally, localization accuracy can be compromised by fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs while relying solely on cost-effective RSSI data.

*Silke K. Kaiser*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper analyzes data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of traffic sensors, demonstrating substantial error reduction in traffic volume predictions on city networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cities lack comprehensive traffic volume data on all street segments due to the high costs of deploying and maintaining sensors. Current sensor placement methods are often biased and reduce prediction quality.

Method: The study benchmarks spatial and temporal strategies for sensor placement using real-world traffic data from Berlin and Manhattan. Spatial strategies focus on centrality, coverage, and active learning, while temporal strategies optimize deployment timing.

Result: Data-driven placement reduced traffic volume prediction errors by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan with only 10 sensors. Temporal optimization further reduced errors by up to 21% in Manhattan.

Conclusion: Cities can significantly improve traffic data accuracy through data-driven sensor placement strategies, enhancing urban mobility management and enabling flexibility in switching between temporary and permanent sensor deployments.

Abstract: Data on citywide street-segment traffic volumes are essential for urban planning and sustainable mobility management. Yet such data are available only for a limited subset of streets due to the high costs of sensor deployment and maintenance. Traffic volumes on the remaining network are therefore interpolated based on existing sensor measurements. However, current sensor locations are often determined by administrative priorities rather than by data-driven optimization, leading to biased coverage and reduced estimation performance. This study provides a large-scale, real-world benchmarking of easily implementable, data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of permanent and temporary traffic sensors, using segment-level data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts). It compares spatial placement strategies based on network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, and active learning. In addition, the study examines temporal deployment schemes for temporary sensors. The findings highlight that spatial placement strategies that emphasize even spatial coverage and employ active learning achieve the lowest prediction errors. With only 10 sensors, they reduce the mean absolute error by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan compared to alternatives. Temporal deployment choices further improve performance: distributing measurements evenly across weekdays reduces error by an additional 7% in Berlin and 21% in Manhattan. Together, these spatial and temporal principles allow temporary deployments to closely approximate the performance of optimally placed permanent deployments. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that cities can substantially improve data usefulness by adopting data-driven sensor placement strategies, while retaining flexibility in choosing between temporary and permanent deployments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOMPnet, an innovative framework combining deep unfolding and dictionary learning to address reliability and complexity challenges in sparse recovery methods for channel estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sparse recovery methods struggle with reliability due to inaccurate physical models and high computational complexity in large MIMO systems.

Method: MOMPnet integrates deep unfolding and data-driven dictionary learning, employing multiple smaller dictionaries for a low-complexity multidimensional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm.

Result: Simulations on realistic channel data show that MOMPnet outperforms multiple baseline methods while mitigating hardware impairments.

Conclusion: MOMPnet is a novel, effective solution for improving both reliability and computational efficiency in sparse recovery for modern communication systems.

Abstract: Sparse recovery methods are essential for channel estimation and localization in modern communication systems, but their reliability relies on accurate physical models, which are rarely perfectly known. Their computational complexity also grows rapidly with the dictionary dimensions in large MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose MOMPnet, a novel unfolded sparse recovery framework that addresses both the reliability and complexity challenges of traditional methods. By integrating deep unfolding with data-driven dictionary learning, MOMPnet mitigates hardware impairments while preserving interpretability. Instead of a single large dictionary, multiple smaller, independent dictionaries are employed, enabling a low-complexity multidimensional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm. The proposed unfolded network is evaluated on realistic channel data against multiple baselines, demonstrating its strong performance and potential.

*Yuki Nakamura,Shingo Takemoto,Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a method to improve noise robustness in dynamic mode decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DMD techniques struggle against noise, leading to unstable and inaccurate representations of dynamical systems.

Method: CR-DMD combines convex optimization methods for noise removal and dimensional reduction, solving them with a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method.

Result: Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets show CR-DMD achieves better mode accuracy and low-dimensional fidelity compared to existing methods in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: CR-DMD enhances the reliability of DMD by addressing mixed noise issues and offering stable, accurate low-dimensional representations.

Abstract: We propose Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a novel framework that robustifies the entire DMD process - from mode extraction to dimensional reduction - against mixed noise. Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fine-tuning method for simulation-driven parameter calibration to address out-of-distribution errors, demonstrated effective through numerical simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate parameter calibration in high-fidelity simulators (digital twins) is frequently hindered by out-of-distribution errors when true parameters exceed the sampled range.

Method: Introduced a fine-tuning approach for the Two-Stage estimator, enhancing its capacity to reduce errors from out-of-distribution parameter predictions.

Result: The proposed approach was validated using numerical simulations, showing improvement in parameter estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The fine-tuning method effectively mitigates OOD effects in simulation-driven parameter estimation, improving reliability and accuracy of system calibration.

Abstract: Many industries now deploy high-fidelity simulators (digital twins) to represent physical systems, yet their parameters must be calibrated to match the true system. This motivated the construction of simulation-driven parameter estimators, built by generating synthetic observations for sampled parameter values and learning a supervised mapping from observations to parameters. However, when the true parameters lie outside the sampled range, predictions suffer from an out-of-distribution (OOD) error. This paper introduces a fine-tuning approach for the Two-Stage estimator that mitigates OOD effects and improves accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations.

*Abdelrahman Ramadan,Sidney Givigi*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a learning-based framework for generating shrinking disturbance-invariant tubes in Model Predictive Control (MPC) under state- and input-dependent uncertainties using Gaussian Process (GP) posteriors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining safety and invariance in uncertain systems for tube MPC by using data-driven methods that adapt over time.

Method: The framework uses Gaussian Process (GP) posteriors to represent uncertainties, converted into polytopic outer sets. A two-time-scale scheme separates learning phases from fixed-point iteration to certify invariance and optimize disturbance tubes.

Result: The methodology leads to nested disturbance polytopes as more data is collected, ensuring monotonic shrinking of disturbance-invariant tubes and resolving dependency issues between verification sets and disturbance models.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates the ability to adaptively shrink disturbance tubes in data-rich areas while maintaining safety and invariance, paving the way for enhanced tube MPC applications.

Abstract: We develop a learning-based framework for constructing shrinking disturbance-invariant tubes under state- and input-dependent uncertainty, intended as a building block for tube Model Predictive Control (MPC), and certify safety via a lifted, isotone (order-preserving) fixed-point map. Gaussian Process (GP) posteriors become $(1-α)$ credible ellipsoids, then polytopic outer sets for deterministic set operations. A two-time-scale scheme separates learning epochs, where these polytopes are frozen, from an inner, outside-in iteration that converges to a compact fixed point $Z^\star\!\subseteq\!\mathcal G$; its state projection is RPI for the plant. As data accumulate, disturbance polytopes tighten, and the associated tubes nest monotonically, resolving the circular dependence between the set to be verified and the disturbance model while preserving hard constraints. A double-integrator study illustrates shrinking tube cross-sections in data-rich regions while maintaining invariance.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for mitigating the mismatch between trained neural networks and noisy edge channel environments by leveraging channel statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the performance deterioration caused by noisy wireless channels in edge inference systems, given that standard neural networks are trained in noiseless conditions.

Method: The paper proposes an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics into the weight space, deduces PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for the effect of wireless distortion, and introduces a channel-aware training algorithm based on these bounds.

Result: The channel-aware training algorithm showed improved inference accuracy using simulation results, without requiring end-to-end re-training.

Conclusion: Incorporating channel statistics directly into training processes for edge inference systems is effective in improving performance in noisy environments, as demonstrated by theoretical bounds and practical simulations.

Abstract: In the emerging paradigm of edge inference, neural networks (NNs) are partitioned across distributed edge devices that collaboratively perform inference via wireless transmission. However, standard NNs are generally trained in a noiseless environment, creating a mismatch with the noisy channels during edge deployment. In this paper, we address this issue by characterizing the channel-induced performance deterioration as a generalization error against unseen channels. We introduce an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics directly into the weight space, allowing us to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that explicitly quantifies the impact of wireless distortion. We further provide closed-form expressions for practical channels to demonstrate the tractability of these bounds. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a channel-aware training algorithm that minimizes a surrogate objective based on the derived bound. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve inference accuracy by leveraging channel statistics, without end-to-end re-training.

Conclusion: The framework provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing and optimizing learned representations in regression, contributing to a better understanding of representational efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: An information-theoretic framework is introduced to analyze last-layer embedding, focusing on learned representations for regression tasks. We define representation-rate and derive limits on the reliability with which input-output information can be represented as is inherently determined by the input-source entropy. We further define representation capacity in a perturbed setting, and representation rate-distortion for a compressed output. We derive the achievable capacity, the achievable representation-rate, and their converse. Finally, we combine the results in a unified setting.

TL;DR: The paper examines challenges and barriers to adopting formal methods in industrial software applied to electronic warfare (EW) systems and proposes improvements for usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the steep learning curves and usability challenges that prevent widespread adoption of formal methods in industrial software engineering, especially for safety-critical systems.

Method: The researchers analyzed formal methods tools on an electronic warfare (EW) system, compared vulnerabilities detected by different tools, and gathered insights from software engineers with no prior formal methods training.

Result: The study highlighted usability issues such as differences in mindset and terminology, and difficulties in grasping input/output contracts and loop invariants. Comparisons of detected vulnerabilities across tools were also provided.

Conclusion: Better documentation, reduced manual effort, and improved library code handling in formal methods tools are recommended to overcome barriers to industrial adoption.

Abstract: While using formal methods offers advantages over unit testing, their steep learning curve can be daunting to developers and can be a major impediment to widespread adoption. To support integration into an industrial software engineering workflow, a tool must provide useful information and must be usable with relatively minimal user effort. In this paper, we discuss our experiences associated with identifying and applying formal methods tools on an electronic warfare (EW) system with stringent safety requirements and present perspectives on formal methods tools from EW software engineers who are proficient in development yet lack formal methods training. In addition to a difference in mindset between formal methods and unit testing approaches, some formal methods tools use terminology or annotations that differ from their target programming language, creating another barrier to adoption. Input/output contracts, objects in memory affected by a function, and loop invariants can be difficult to grasp and use. In addition to usability, our findings include a comparison of vulnerabilities detected by different tools. Finally, we present suggestions for improving formal methods usability including better documentation of capabilities, decreased manual effort, and improved handling of library code.

TL;DR: The study focuses on enhancing robustness in nonlinear regression using the interval conditional value-at-risk (In-CVaR), exploring contamination and perturbation aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address robustness issues in statistical and nonlinear regression, particularly under perturbation and contamination.

Method: Robust analysis through trimming extreme losses using In-CVaR, complemented by theoretical studies and numerical experiments.

Result: In-CVaR exhibits superior robustness against contamination and qualitatively robust estimations under perturbations.

Conclusion: In-CVaR is a robust risk measure that outperforms traditional methods in statistical learning for nonlinear regression.

Abstract: Robustness under perturbation and contamination is a prominent issue in statistical learning. We address the robust nonlinear regression based on the so-called interval conditional value-at-risk (In-CVaR), which is introduced to enhance robustness by trimming extreme losses. While recent literature shows that the In-CVaR based statistical learning exhibits superior robustness performance than classical robust regression models, its theoretical robustness analysis for nonlinear regression remains largely unexplored. We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and Huber losses. Moreover, we analyze the qualitative robustness of the In-CVaR based estimator under perturbation. We show that under several minor assumptions, the In-CVaR based estimator is qualitatively robust in terms of the Prokhorov metric if and only if the largest portion of losses is trimmed. Overall, this study analyzes robustness properties of In-CVaR based nonlinear regression models under both perturbation and contamination, which illustrates the advantages of In-CVaR risk measure over conditional value-at-risk and expectation for robust regression in both theory and numerical experiments.

TL;DR: This paper develops a novel model-free policy gradient algorithm (MF-REINFORCE) for discrete-time mean-field control problems, overcoming challenges caused by dependency on population state distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in policy-based approaches to mean-field control problems, which are underexplored due to dependence on evolving population state distributions, unlike value-based methods.

Method: The authors propose a perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow, enabling the derivation of policy gradients through a model-free estimator. This solution builds the basis for MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm.

Result: The paper provides theoretical bounds on bias and error of the proposed method and demonstrates its effectiveness via numerical experiments in mean-field control tasks.

Conclusion: The study contributes by introducing a viable model-free method for policy learning in mean-field control problems, supported by theoretical analysis and experimental validations.

Abstract: We study model-free policy learning for discrete-time mean-field control (MFC) problems with finite state space and compact action space. In contrast to the extensive literature on value-based methods for MFC, policy-based approaches remain largely unexplored due to the intrinsic dependence of transition kernels and rewards on the evolving population state distribution, which prevents the direct use of likelihood-ratio estimators of policy gradients from classical single-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error. Numerical experiments on representative mean-field control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: The authors aim to improve the methodology for solving optimal path design problems by enabling flexibility in dealing with linear, nonlinear inverse problems, and handling the utility function's distribution tail.

Method: A discrete path optimization problem is reformulated into a stochastic optimization problem using a parametric Markov policy to model trajectories as random variables.

Result: The paper demonstrates numerical verification and analysis through a parameter identification problem commonly used in model-based optimal experimental design.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic framework enhances versatility and applicability in optimal experimental design for solving various inverse problems.

Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic approach for optimal path experimental design. In this approach a discrete path optimization problem is defined on a static navigation mesh, and trajectories are modeled as random variables governed by a parametric Markov policy. The discrete path optimization problem is then replaced with an equivalent stochastic optimization problem over the policy parameters, resulting in an optimal probability model that samples estimates of the optimal discrete path. This approach enables exploration of the utility function's distribution tail and treats the utility function of the design as a black box, making it applicable to linear and nonlinear inverse problems and beyond experimental design. Numerical verification and analysis are carried out by using a parameter identification problem widely used in model-based optimal experimental design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop simple, efficient, and luminous actuators to enhance tactile feedback in human-machine interface systems.

Method: Pulsed light heats a graphite photoabsorber in a gas-filled cavity, producing pressure changes that drive forces and displacements in an elastic membrane diaphragm.

Result: HLEDs achieved forces of over 0.4 N, 1 mm displacements, and response times between 5-100 ms, demonstrating effective tactile feedback capabilities.

Conclusion: HLEDs provide a unique combination of mechanical actuation and light emission with applications in tactile displays, interface engineering, and wearable technologies.

Abstract: We present Haptic Light-Emitting Diodes (HLEDs), luminous thermopneumatic actuators that directly convert pulsed light into mechanical forces and displacements. Each device packages a miniature surface-mount LED in a gas-filled cavity that contains a low-inertia graphite photoabsorber. The cavity is sealed by an elastic membrane, which functions as a working diaphragm. Brief optical pulses heat the photoabsorber, which heats the gas. The resulting rapid pressure increases generate forces and displacements at the working diaphragm. Millimeter-scale HLEDs produce forces exceeding 0.4 N and displacements of 1 mm at low voltages, with 5 to 100 ms response times, making them attractive as actuators providing tactile feedback in human-machine interfaces. Perceptual testing revealed that the strength of tactile feedback increased linearly with optical power. HLEDs devices are mechanically simple and efficient to fabricate. Unusually, these actuators are also light-emitting, as a fraction of optical energy is transmitted through the membrane. These opto-mechanical actuators have many potential applications in tactile displays, human interface engineering, wearable computing, and other areas.

Main category: cs.HC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand if LLMs can simulate human decision-making behavior and cognitive bias under varying dialogue complexity and cognitive load.

Method: A pre-registered study with 1,648 participants completed decision-making tasks via chatbot dialogues of varying complexity. LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-5, and open-source models were tested for predictive accuracy.

Result: Participants displayed cognitive biases that intensified under cognitive load. GPT-4 predictions closely aligned with human patterns, performing better than GPT-5 and open-source models in capturing bias and load-bias interactions.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially GPT-4, are effective tools for modeling human decision-making and simulating how biases interact with cognitive load. This can improve adaptive conversational agent design.

Abstract: We examine whether large language models (LLMs) can predict biased decision-making in conversational settings, and whether their predictions capture not only human cognitive biases but also how those effects change under cognitive load. In a pre-registered study (N = 1,648), participants completed six classic decision-making tasks via a chatbot with dialogues of varying complexity. Participants exhibited two well-documented cognitive biases: the Framing Effect and the Status Quo Bias. Increased dialogue complexity resulted in participants reporting higher mental demand. This increase in cognitive load selectively, but significantly, increased the effect of the biases, demonstrating the load-bias interaction. We then evaluated whether LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-5, and open-source models) could predict individual decisions given demographic information and prior dialogue. While results were mixed across choice problems, LLM predictions that incorporated dialogue context were significantly more accurate in several key scenarios. Importantly, their predictions reproduced the same bias patterns and load-bias interactions observed in humans. Across all models tested, the GPT-4 family consistently aligned with human behavior, outperforming GPT-5 and open-source models in both predictive accuracy and fidelity to human-like bias patterns. These findings advance our understanding of LLMs as tools for simulating human decision-making and inform the design of conversational agents that adapt to user biases.

### [259] [Temporal Complexity and Self-Organization in an Exponential Dense Associative Memory Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11478)
*Marco Cafiso,Paolo Paradisi*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models demonstrate enhanced storage via upgraded interactions. This study examines the stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) focusing on self-organizing and complex temporal behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Temporal Complexity, linked with self-organizing dynamics and intermittent order-disorder transitions, manifests in Dense Associative Memory models under learning.

Method: Analyzed a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model using temporal complexity indicators related to neural avalanches and coincidence structures across varying levels of memory load and noise intensity.

Result: SEDAM showed self-organizing dynamics and scale-free temporal patterns under specific noise intensities. Noise range for critical behavior narrows with increased memory load.

Conclusion: TC offers valuable insights into learning processes in DAM models, connecting memory load with self-organizing dynamics and supporting extended criticality concepts in neural systems.

Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models generalize the classical Hopfield model by incorporating n-body or exponential interactions that greatly enhance storage capacity. While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.

### [260] [Zero-Shot Detection of Elastic Transient Morphology Across Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11415)
*Jose Sánchez Andreu*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper explores whether a neural network can analyze unseen sensor signals by leveraging a model trained on elastic-like transients from gravitational-wave observatories. It achieves promising anomaly detection results but has limitations on certain vibration signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generalized morphology-sensitive operator capable of analyzing unseen sensor signals without retraining, focusing on coherent elastic transient patterns in signals.

Method: A neural encoder trained on non-Gaussian glitches was used to perform zero-shot anomaly analysis on multiple datasets (e.g., bearing failure and vibration signals). The approach avoided fine-tuning or additional training.

Result: Achieved high anomaly detection performance on datasets like IMS-NASA (health index monitoring, HI(t)), with AUC metrics around 0.90-0.99. Generic neural networks like EfficientNet failed in tests involving coherence sensitivity, emphasizing the importance of the developed operator's specialized design.

Conclusion: Interferometric representations show significant potential for monitoring elastic transient signals in unseen systems, though performance is bounded by the coherence of the signal structure and physical properties of the domain.

Abstract: We test whether a representation learned from interferometric strain transients in gravitational-wave observatories can act as a frozen morphology-sensitive operator for unseen sensors, provided the target signals preserve coherent elastic transient structure. Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels.
  On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer.
  Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.

### [261] [The Poisoned Apple Effect: Strategic Manipulation of Mediated Markets via Technology Expansion of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11496)
*Eilam Shapira,Roi Reichart,Moshe Tennenholtz*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper studies how introducing AI agents impacts strategic economic interactions and market outcomes, revealing the need for adaptive regulatory frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how AI technologies transform economic strategies and regulatory frameworks in critical game-theoretic contexts.

Method: The authors analyze three game-theoretic settings—bargaining, negotiation, and persuasion—and explore the implications of introducing AI technologies and strategic behaviors like the 'Poisoned Apple' effect.

Result: The study finds that increasing AI agent options significantly alters equilibrium payoffs and incentives, often compelling regulators to adapt. It also outlines a manipulative phenomenon ('Poisoned Apple effect') where technology is released strategically to influence regulatory decisions.

Conclusion: Static regulatory frameworks are insufficient in the face of evolving AI capabilities. Dynamic and adaptive market designs are essential to address strategic manipulations and ensure fairness.

Abstract: The integration of AI agents into economic markets fundamentally alters the landscape of strategic interaction. We investigate the economic implications of expanding the set of available technologies in three canonical game-theoretic settings: bargaining (resource division), negotiation (asymmetric information trade), and persuasion (strategic information transmission). We find that simply increasing the choice of AI delegates can drastically shift equilibrium payoffs and regulatory outcomes, often creating incentives for regulators to proactively develop and release technologies. Conversely, we identify a strategic phenomenon termed the "Poisoned Apple" effect: an agent may release a new technology, which neither they nor their opponent ultimately uses, solely to manipulate the regulator's choice of market design in their favor. This strategic release improves the releaser's welfare at the expense of their opponent and the regulator's fairness objectives. Our findings demonstrate that static regulatory frameworks are vulnerable to manipulation via technology expansion, necessitating dynamic market designs that adapt to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Institutional AI,' a system-level framework to align multi-agent AI by focusing on governance in institution-space, achieving significant reductions in harmful behavior compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by coordinated harmful behaviors in multi-agent AI systems and reframe AI alignment from individual preferences to institution-level governance.

Method: The paper introduces a governance graph framework combined with Oracle/Controller runtime to monitor, enforce, and audit AI behaviors through predefined rules and mechanisms.

Result: Applying the Institutional AI framework in simulation reduced collusion significantly compared to both unregulated and simple prompt-based approaches, showcasing effectiveness in minimizing harmful coordination between AI agents.

Conclusion: Institutional AI, through governance graphs and institutional design, offers a promising pathway to align multi-agent systems and mitigate socially harmful behaviors.

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM ensembles can converge on coordinated, socially harmful equilibria. This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure. These results suggest that multi-agent alignment may benefit from being framed as an institutional design problem, where governance graphs can provide a tractable abstraction for alignment-relevant collective behavior.

### [263] [New Adaptive Mechanism for Large Neighborhood Search using Dual Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11414)
*Shaohua Yu,Wenhao Mao,Zigao Wu,Jakob Puchinger*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) based adaptive mechanism for improving Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS), addressing the interaction between destroy and repair operators using Graph Neural Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of classic ALNS algorithms that fail to consider interactions between destroy and repair operators during operator selection.

Method: The proposed method introduces a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, modeling destroy and repair as independent Markov Decision Processes, enhanced by Graph Neural Networks for feature extraction and transferability.

Result: The DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and is transferable across different problem sizes and characteristics.

Conclusion: DAC-ALNS effectively leverages the interaction between operators, improving the adaptability and efficiency of the ALNS heuristic with excellent transferability.

Abstract: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.

*Rushikesh Handal,Masanori Hirano*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: This paper introduces KANHedge, an enhanced BSDE-based method using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, which shows improved hedging performance over traditional MLP-based approaches in high-dimensional option pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional PDE and MLP-based methods in handling the curse of dimensionality and improving hedging performance in quantitative finance.

Method: The authors propose KANHedge, a novel BSDE-based approach employing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with learnable B-spline activation functions for enhanced function approximation.

Result: KANHedge is shown to achieve comparable pricing accuracy but significantly improves hedging performance, reducing hedging cost metrics and offering better risk control in high-dimensional market scenarios.

Conclusion: KANHedge provides a more effective solution for high-dimensional option pricing and hedging, especially in terms of hedging performance, demonstrating its practical utility in quantitative finance.

Abstract: High-dimensional option pricing and hedging present significant challenges in quantitative finance, where traditional PDE-based methods struggle with the curse of dimensionality. The BSDE framework offers a computationally efficient alternative to PDE-based methods, and recently proposed deep BSDE solvers, generally utilizing conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), build upon this framework to provide a scalable alternative to numerical BSDE solvers. In this research, we show that although such MLP-based deep BSDEs demonstrate promising results in option pricing, there remains room for improvement regarding hedging performance. To address this issue, we introduce KANHedge, a novel BSDE-based hedger that leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within the BSDE framework. Unlike conventional MLP approaches that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable B-spline activation functions that provide enhanced function approximation capabilities for continuous derivatives. We comprehensively evaluate KANHedge on both European and American basket options across multiple dimensions and market conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while KANHedge and MLP achieve comparable pricing accuracy, KANHedge provides improved hedging performance. Specifically, KANHedge achieves considerable reductions in hedging cost metrics, demonstrating enhanced risk control capabilities.

*Huanxiang Lin,Qianyue Wang,Jinwu Hu,Bailin Chen,Qing Du,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: EvidFuse is a training-free multi-agent framework for generating data-driven reports with real-time interleaving of text and charts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems typically generate narratives and visualizations in separate stages, leading to issues like chart-text inconsistency and shallow analysis.

Method: EvidFuse uses two components: a Data-Augmented Analysis Agent for exploratory data analysis and a Real-Time Evidence Construction Writer to plan and draft reports while integrating visual evidence.

Result: EvidFuse achieves top performance in evaluations measuring chart quality, alignment between text and visuals, and overall report usefulness.

Conclusion: The framework improves the integration of text and charts in data-driven reports, offering real-time evidence adaptation and addressing limitations of conventional approaches.

Abstract: Data-driven reports communicate decision-relevant insights by tightly interleaving narrative text with charts grounded in underlying tables. However, current LLM-based systems typically generate narratives and visualizations in staged pipelines, following either a text-first-graph-second or a graph-first-text-second paradigm. These designs often lead to chart-text inconsistency and insight freezing, where the intermediate evidence space becomes fixed and the model can no longer retrieve or construct new visual evidence as the narrative evolves, resulting in shallow and predefined analysis. To address the limitations, we propose \textbf{EvidFuse}, a training-free multi-agent framework that enables writing-time text-chart interleaved generation for data-driven reports. EvidFuse decouples visualization analysis from long-form drafting via two collaborating components: a \textbf{Data-Augmented Analysis Agent}, equipped with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-derived knowledge and access to raw tables, and a \textbf{Real-Time Evidence Construction Writer} that plans an outline and drafts the report while intermittently issuing fine-grained analysis requests. This design allows visual evidence to be constructed and incorporated exactly when the narrative requires it, directly constraining subsequent claims and enabling on-demand expansion of the evidence space. Experiments demonstrate that EvidFuse attains the top rank in both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations on chart quality, chart-text alignment, and report-level usefulness.

TL;DR: This paper explores AI's macroeconomic impact in the US, focusing on the role of data centers and their influence on investment, demand, and GDP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how the current AI wave influences the economy, particularly through AI-related infrastructure and investments.

Method: Utilized a macro-accounting framework combined with an AI production process analysis. Focused on data centers' role in meeting AI service demands.

Result: Found that data center investments significantly boost aggregate demand but contribute more modestly to GDP due to high import content of AI hardware.

Conclusion: AI services from new data centers can substantially impact GDP, though reinvestment cycles and fluctuating demand could pose future macroeconomic risks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has moved to the center of policy, market, and academic debates, but its macroeconomic footprint is still only partly understood. This paper provides an overview on how the current AI wave is captured in US national accounts, combining a simple macro-accounting framework with a stylized description of the AI production process. We highlight the crucial role played by data centers, which constitute the backbone of the AI ecosystem and have attracted formidable investment in 2025, as they are indispensable for meeting the rapidly increasing worldwide demand for AI services. We document that the boom in IT and AI-related capital expenditure in the first three quarters of the year has given an outsized boost to aggregate demand, while its contribution to GDP growth is smaller once the high import content of AI hardware is netted out. Furthermore, simple calculations suggest that, at current utilization rates and pricing, the production of services originating in new AI data centers could contribute to GDP over the turn of the next quarters on a scale comparable to that of investment spending to date. Short reinvestment cycles and uncertainty about future AI demand, while not currently acting as a macroeconomic drag, can nevertheless fuel macroeconomic risks over the medium term.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces the DSA-Tokenizer, designed for improved disentanglement of speech into semantic and acoustic tokens, enhancing speech modeling and generation in discrete Speech LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech tokenizers play a critical role in Speech LLMs, yet existing methods face challenges in disentangling semantic and acoustic information effectively.

Method: The DSA-Tokenizer explicitly separates speech into semantic and acoustic tokens using distinct optimization constraints, supervised by ASR for semantic tokens and mel-spectrogram restoration for acoustic tokens. It also employs a hierarchical Flow-Matching decoder and joint reconstruction-recombination strategy for improved quality and flexibility.

Result: The tokenizer succeeds in enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, flexible recombination, and robust disentanglement, showcasing its potential for controllable generation in speech LLMs.

Conclusion: Disentangled tokenization is a promising paradigm for advancing speech modeling, and the DSA-Tokenizer achieves robust separation and improved generation quality.

Abstract: Speech tokenizers serve as the cornerstone of discrete Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). Existing tokenizers either prioritize semantic encoding, fuse semantic content with acoustic style inseparably, or achieve incomplete semantic-acoustic disentanglement. To achieve better disentanglement, we propose DSA-Tokenizer, which explicitly disentangles speech into discrete semantic and acoustic tokens via distinct optimization constraints. Specifically, semantic tokens are supervised by ASR to capture linguistic content, while acoustic tokens focus on mel-spectrograms restoration to encode style. To eliminate rigid length constraints between the two sequences, we introduce a hierarchical Flow-Matching decoder that further improve speech generation quality. Furthermore, We employ a joint reconstruction-recombination training strategy to enforce this separation. DSA-Tokenizer enables high fidelity reconstruction and flexible recombination through robust disentanglement, facilitating controllable generation in speech LLMs. Our analysis highlights disentangled tokenization as a pivotal paradigm for future speech modeling. Audio samples are avaialble at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/DSA_Tokenizer_demo/. The code and model will be made publicly available after the paper has been accepted.

TL;DR: This paper introduces General-Purpose Audio (GPA), a unified audio model for TTS, ASR, and VC tasks within a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speech systems use separate models for different tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited scalability.

Method: GPA employs a shared discrete audio token space in a large language model, supporting multi-task training and unified inference.

Result: The unified model achieves competitive performance across various speech tasks and supports efficient, scalable deployment, including edge environments.

Conclusion: A unified autoregressive architecture can generalize across speech domains, improving scalability and practical deployment.

Abstract: Traditional speech systems typically rely on separate, task-specific models for text-to-speech (TTS), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and voice conversion (VC), resulting in fragmented pipelines that limit scalability, efficiency, and cross-task generalization. In this paper, we present General-Purpose Audio (GPA), a unified audio foundation model that integrates multiple core speech tasks within a single large language model (LLM) architecture. GPA operates on a shared discrete audio token space and supports instruction-driven task induction, enabling a single autoregressive model to flexibly perform TTS, ASR, and VC without architectural modifications. This unified design combines a fully autoregressive formulation over discrete speech tokens, joint multi-task training across speech domains, and a scalable inference pipeline that achieves high concurrency and throughput. The resulting model family supports efficient multi-scale deployment, including a lightweight 0.3B-parameter variant optimized for edge and resource-constrained environments. Together, these design choices demonstrate that a unified autoregressive architecture can achieve competitive performance across diverse speech tasks while remaining viable for low-latency, practical deployment.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SonicBench, a benchmark to evaluate large audio language models' ability to understand fundamental audio attributes, revealing significant deficiencies in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio language models excel in semantic tasks but lack evaluation in fundamental physical attributes like pitch and loudness.

Method: The study introduces SonicBench using a controllable generation tool to test 12 physical attributes in two paradigms: recognition and comparison.

Result: Models mostly perform at random, struggle with comparison tasks, and explicit reasoning offers minimal improvement, despite audio encoders capturing physical cues well.

Conclusion: The misalignment and decoding stages of large audio language models hinder their ability to utilize the sensory signals captured by audio encoders.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) excel at semantic and paralinguistic tasks, yet their ability to perceive the fundamental physical attributes of audio such as pitch, loudness, and spatial location remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SonicBench, a psychophysically grounded benchmark that systematically evaluates 12 core physical attributes across five perceptual dimensions. Unlike previous datasets, SonicBench uses a controllable generation toolbox to construct stimuli for two complementary paradigms: recognition (absolute judgment) and comparison (relative judgment). This design allows us to probe not only sensory precision but also relational reasoning capabilities, a domain where humans typically exhibit greater proficiency. Our evaluation reveals a substantial deficiency in LALMs' foundational auditory understanding; most models perform near random guessing and, contrary to human patterns, fail to show the expected advantage on comparison tasks. Furthermore, explicit reasoning yields minimal gains. However, our linear probing analysis demonstrates crucially that frozen audio encoders do successfully capture these physical cues (accuracy at least 60%), suggesting that the primary bottleneck lies in the alignment and decoding stages, where models fail to leverage the sensory signals they have already captured.

Conclusion: Chroma 1.0 sets a new standard for high-quality, low-latency personalized voice dialogue, offering open-source access to its models and code.

Abstract: Recent end-to-end spoken dialogue systems leverage speech tokenizers and neural audio codecs to enable LLMs to operate directly on discrete speech representations.

*Joanne Affolter,Benjamin Martin,Elena V. Epure,Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal,Frédéric Kaplan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces LIVI, a new system for Music Cover Retrieval. LIVI focuses on using lyrics as a strong invariant across covers to achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of Music Cover Retrieval is crucial for catalog management, copyright enforcement, and retrieval. Existing methods primarily rely on harmonic and melodic features but are resource-intensive. Lyrics, while invariant across covers, have been underutilized due to difficulties in accurate extraction.

Method: The LIVI approach uses supervision from advanced transcription and text embedding models during training. At inference, it avoids the resource-heavy transcription step to achieve efficiency.

Result: LIVI achieves retrieval accuracy comparable to or better than existing harmonic-based systems while remaining lightweight and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: LIVI successfully balances accuracy and efficiency, offering a simplified alternative to complexity-heavy pipelines in Music Cover Retrieval.

Abstract: Music Cover Retrieval, also known as Version Identification, aims to recognize distinct renditions of the same underlying musical work, a task central to catalog management, copyright enforcement, and music retrieval. State-of-the-art approaches have largely focused on harmonic and melodic features, employing increasingly complex audio pipelines designed to be invariant to musical attributes that often vary widely across covers. While effective, these methods demand substantial training time and computational resources. By contrast, lyrics constitute a strong invariant across covers, though their use has been limited by the difficulty of extracting them accurately and efficiently from polyphonic audio. Early methods relied on simple frameworks that limited downstream performance, while more recent systems deliver stronger results but require large models integrated within complex multimodal architectures. We introduce LIVI (Lyrics-Informed Version Identification), an approach that seeks to balance retrieval accuracy with computational efficiency. First, LIVI leverages supervision from state-of-the-art transcription and text embedding models during training to achieve retrieval accuracy on par with--or superior to--harmonic-based systems. Second, LIVI remains lightweight and efficient by removing the transcription step at inference, challenging the dominance of complexity-heavy pipelines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning framework for detecting depression using EEG signals, achieving a high accuracy of 98.74%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of conventional diagnostic methods for depression, which are subjective and less reliable, by developing objective approaches for early detection using EEG signals.

Method: The study combines CNNs and GRUs for extracting spatial and temporal features from EEG data, employs the MRMR algorithm to choose informative features, and uses a fully connected neural network for classification.

Result: The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.74% in identifying depressive states, leveraging both temporal and spatial EEG features.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising tool for accurate early detection of depression, with potential applications in enhancing diagnosis, treatment strategies, and patient care.

Abstract: This study investigates the detection and classification of depressive and non-depressive states using deep learning approaches. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that substantially affects quality of life, and early diagnosis can greatly enhance treatment effectiveness and patient care. However, conventional diagnostic methods rely heavily on self-reported assessments, which are often subjective and may lack reliability. Consequently, there is a strong need for objective and accurate techniques to identify depressive states. In this work, a deep learning based framework is proposed for the early detection of depression using EEG signals. EEG data, which capture underlying brain activity and are not influenced by external behavioral factors, can reveal subtle neural changes associated with depression. The proposed approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to jointly extract spatial and temporal features from EEG recordings. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm is then applied to select the most informative features, followed by classification using a fully connected neural network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high performance in accurately identifying depressive states, with an overall accuracy of 98.74%. By effectively integrating temporal and spatial information and employing optimized feature selection, this method shows strong potential as a reliable tool for clinical applications. Overall, the proposed framework not only enables accurate early detection of depression but also has the potential to support improved treatment strategies and patient outcomes.

Motivation: To address the uncertainty and versatility in modeling irreversible kinetics, especially in non-convex or temporally coupled constraints, by incorporating probabilistic formulations.

Method: The approach utilizes a Gibbs-type measure derived from an energy-dissipation action and observation constraints under Bayesian principles, including maximizing posterior histories in deterministic cases and using minimum-action principles for inverse problems.

Result: Classical deterministic outcomes are recovered in zero-uncertainty cases, while non-convex and coupled problems are handled probabilistically. The method was tested through seven forward-time examples and one inverse problem.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic formulation bridges deterministic and probabilistic approaches in irreversible kinetics, offering robust solutions for challenging scenarios.

Abstract: A probabilistic formulation of irreversible kinetics is introduced in which incrementally admissible histories are weighted by a Gibbs-type measure built from an energy-dissipation action and observation constraints, with Theta controlling epistemic uncertainty. This measure can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior over histories. In the zero-uncertainty limit, it concentrates on maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) histories, recovering classical deterministic evolution by incremental minimization in the convex generalized-standard-material setting, while allowing multiple competing MAP histories for non-convex energies or temporally coupled constraints. This emergence is demonstrated across seven distinct forward-in-time examples and an inverse inference problem of unknown histories from sparse observations via a global constrained minimum-action principle.

### [274] [Learning collision operators from plasma phase space data using differentiable simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10885)
*Diogo D. Carvalho,Pablo J. Bilbao,Warren B. Mori,Luis O. Silva,E. Paulo Alves*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method to infer collision operators in plasma dynamics using a differentiable approach, tested with Particle-in-Cell simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the understanding and modeling of plasma dynamics by proposing an efficient method for inferring collision operators without prior assumptions on time-scales.

Method: The paper introduces a differentiable kinetic simulator with a Fokker-Planck solver and gradient-based optimization to learn collisional operators directly from phase-space data.

Result: Learned operators are more accurate than traditional particle-track-based estimates, aligning well with theoretical predictions while lowering memory requirements.

Conclusion: Differentiable simulators provide a powerful and efficient way to uncover operators for complex plasma dynamics, extending to broader electromagnetic and stochastic scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a methodology to infer collision operators from phase space data of plasma dynamics. Our approach combines a differentiable kinetic simulator, whose core component in this work is a differentiable Fokker-Planck solver, with a gradient-based optimisation method to learn the collisional operators that best describe the phase space dynamics. We test our method using data from two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations of spatially uniform thermal plasmas, and learn the collision operator that captures the self-consistent electromagnetic interaction between finite-size charged particles over a wide variety of simulation parameters. We demonstrate that the learned operators are more accurate than alternative estimates based on particle tracks, while making no prior assumptions about the relevant time-scales of the processes and significantly reducing memory requirements. We find that the retrieved operators, obtained in the non-relativistic regime, are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions derived for electrostatic scenarios. Our results show that differentiable simulators offer a powerful and computational efficient approach to infer novel operators for a wide rage of problems, such as electromagnetically dominated collisional dynamics and stochastic wave-particle interactions.

*Ishraq Tashdid,Tasnuva Farheen,Sazadur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces InterPUF, a scalable authentication framework for reconfigurable interposers in SiP platforms, emphasizing security through decentralized trust models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address severe trust challenges arising in SiP platforms due to the adoption of reconfigurable interposers that fail to scale with traditional authentication methods in decentralized environments.

Method: InterPUF transforms the interposer into a distributed root of trust using a route-based differential delay PUF and secures authentication with multi-party computation (MPC).

Result: Hardware evaluation demonstrates minimal area (0.23%) and power overhead (0.072%) while maintaining authentication latency in tens of nanoseconds, and simulations validate strong robustness against variations under PUF testing.

Conclusion: InterPUF achieves a decentralized and scalable authentication model without relying on centralized anchors, ensuring security in multi-vendor SiP ecosystems.

Abstract: Modern system-in-package (SiP) platforms increasingly adopt reconfigurable interposers to enable plug-and-play chiplet integration across heterogeneous multi-vendor ecosystems. However, this flexibility introduces severe trust challenges, as traditional authentication schemes fail to scale or adapt in decentralized, post-fabrication programmable environments. This paper presents InterPUF, a compact and scalable authentication framework that transforms the interposer into a distributed root of trust. InterPUF embeds a route-based differential delay physically unclonable function (PUF) across the reconfigurable interconnect and secures authentication using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring raw PUF signatures are never exposed. Our hardware evaluation shows only 0.23% area and 0.072% power overhead across diverse chiplets while preserving authentication latency within tens of nanoseconds. Simulation results using pyPUF confirm strong uniqueness, reliability, and modeling resistance under process, voltage, and temperature variations. By combining interposer-resident PUF primitives with cryptographic hashing and collaborative verification, InterPUF enforces a minimal-trust authentication model without relying on a centralized anchor.

*Wadid Foudhaili,Aykut Rencber,Anouar Nechi,Rainer Buchty,Mladen Berekovic,Andres Gomez,Saleh Mulhem*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) using neural networks to detect AXI protocol violations and mitigate denial-of-service attacks with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in the Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol in Systems-on-Chip (SoCs), which allow denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through protocol violations. Current countermeasures fail to effectively perform real-time protocol semantic analysis or ensure protocol compliance.

Method: IMS is developed as a hardware monitoring module utilizing a quantized neural network for real-time analysis of AXI transactions. A dataset is generated using DoS attack simulations to train the neural network, which is optimized for high detection accuracy. IMS is implemented as a memory-mapped IP core in a RISC-V SoC and demonstrated on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ board.

Result: The IMS achieves 98.7% detection accuracy, latency overhead ≤3%, throughput >2.5 million inferences/s, and a small hardware footprint (9.04% LUTs, 0.23% DSP slices, 0.70% flip-flops).

Conclusion: The results show that the IMS is a lightweight, effective, and feasible solution for real-time AXI protocol violation detection, making it suitable for security monitoring in resource-constrained edge environments.

Abstract: In the modern Systems-on-Chip (SoC), the Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol exhibits security vulnerabilities, enabling partial or complete denial-of-service (DoS) through protocol-violation attacks. The recent countermeasures lack a dedicated real-time protocol semantic analysis and evade protocol compliance checks. This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with <=3% latency overhead, and throughput of >2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency. This demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight, security monitoring for resource-constrained edge environments.

*Xinrui Zhang,Pincan Zhao,Jason Jaskolka,Heng Li,Rongxing Lu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SecMLOps, a framework for integrating security into all stages of the ML lifecycle, demonstrated with a use case on pedestrian detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security challenges, such as adversarial attacks, posed by the deployment of ML models in critical systems.

Method: The paper proposes SecMLOps, a framework embedding security measures throughout the MLOps lifecycle, and tests it using a pedestrian detection system.

Result: The framework effectively secures ML operations against attacks, while empirical evaluations highlight the trade-offs between security and operational performance.

Conclusion: Balancing security and performance is essential for resilient and efficient ML deployments, as shown through SecMLOps' utility in safeguarding complex systems.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal technology in the operation of large and complex systems, driving advancements in fields such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and financial fraud detection. Despite its benefits, the deployment of ML models brings significant security challenges, such as adversarial attacks, which can compromise the integrity and reliability of these systems. To address these challenges, this paper builds upon the concept of Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps), providing a comprehensive framework designed to integrate robust security measures throughout the entire ML operations (MLOps) lifecycle. SecMLOps builds on the principles of MLOps by embedding security considerations from the initial design phase through to deployment and continuous monitoring. This framework is particularly focused on safeguarding against sophisticated attacks that target various stages of the MLOps lifecycle, thereby enhancing the resilience and trustworthiness of ML applications. A detailed advanced pedestrian detection system (PDS) use case demonstrates the practical application of SecMLOps in securing critical MLOps. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we highlight the trade-offs between security measures and system performance, providing critical insights into optimizing security without unduly impacting operational efficiency. Our findings underscore the importance of a balanced approach, offering valuable guidance for practitioners on how to achieve an optimal balance between security and performance in ML deployments across various domains.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemTaint, a system that combines static program analysis and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve JavaScript vulnerability detection using SAST tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static taint analysis in JavaScript is complicated due to dynamic features and the vast npm library ecosystem. A novel approach is needed to address these issues and improve vulnerability detection.

Method: SemTaint leverages static program analysis to calculate call graphs and utilizes LLMs for resolving unresolved call edges, classifying sources and sinks, and providing custom taint specifications to SAST tools.

Result: SemTaint was integrated with CodeQL, detecting 106 out of 162 vulnerabilities that CodeQL previously missed and discovering 4 new vulnerabilities in popular npm packages.

Conclusion: LLMs can enhance static program analysis by combining symbolic reasoning and semantic understanding, improving vulnerability detection in JavaScript applications.

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools using taint analysis are widely viewed as providing higher-quality vulnerability detection results compared to traditional pattern-based approaches. However, performing static taint analysis for JavaScript poses two major challenges. First, JavaScript's dynamic features complicate data flow extraction required for taint tracking. Second, npm's large library ecosystem makes it difficult to identify relevant sources/sinks and establish taint propagation across dependencies. In this paper, we present SemTaint, a multi-agent system that strategically combines the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional static program analysis to extract taint specifications, including sources, sinks, call edges, and library flow summaries tailored to each package. Conceptually, SemTaint uses static program analysis to calculate a call graph and defers to an LLM to resolve call edges that cannot be resolved statically. Further, it uses the LLM to classify sources and sinks for a given CWE. The resulting taint specification is then provided to a SAST tool, which performs vulnerability analysis. We integrate SemTaint with CodeQL, a state-of-the-art SAST tool, and demonstrate its effectiveness by detecting 106 of 162 vulnerabilities previously undetectable by CodeQL. Furthermore, we find 4 novel vulnerabilities in 4 popular npm packages. In doing so, we demonstrate that LLMs can practically enhance existing static program analysis algorithms, combining the strengths of both symbolic reasoning and semantic understanding for improved vulnerability detection.

### [279] [Beyond Max Tokens: Stealthy Resource Amplification via Tool Calling Chains in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10955)
*Kaiyu Zhou,Yongsen Zheng,Yicheng He,Meng Xue,Xueluan Gong,Yuji Wang,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in the agent-tool interaction within LLM agents, proposing a multi-turn stealthy economic DoS attack that exploits these interactions to inflate computational costs while maintaining task correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents have a critical security issue in their agent-tool communication loop, which is vulnerable to multi-turn economic DoS attacks, escaping detection due to current validation limitations.

Method: The attack modifies text-visible fields and tool return templates using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. It prolongs agent-tool sequences with text-only notices while maintaining task correctness and protocol compatibility.

Result: In experiments with six LLMs on ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, the attack inflated cost by up to 658x, increased energy consumption by 100-560x, and reduced throughput by 50%, while remaining undetected due to protocol and task correctness.

Conclusion: The agent-tool interface requires a security overhaul, shifting from validating the final task result to monitoring the entire agentic process to mitigate economic and computational threats effectively.

Abstract: The agent-tool communication loop is a critical attack surface in modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.

### [280] [AJAR: Adaptive Jailbreak Architecture for Red-teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10971)
*Yipu Dou,Wang Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AJAR, a new framework for testing safety of autonomous agent LLMs, bridges the gap in existing red-teaming tools by introducing modular, adaptive architectures to simulate complex exploitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety and red-teaming measures focus on static chatbots and lack adaptability for emerging autonomous LLMs that can execute tools, creating a need for frameworks addressing this new landscape.

Method: The proposed AJAR framework uses Protocol-driven Cognitive Orchestration under a Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing modular integration of adversarial algorithms and enabling complex exploitations in AI agents.

Result: The feasibility of AJAR was validated through controlled studies, showing effective stateful backtracking and highlighting a dynamic interplay between tool use and persona-based safety vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: AJAR is open-sourced to promote standardized evaluation of agentic LLM attack surfaces and represents a significant step toward adaptive AI safety frameworks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from static chatbots into autonomous agents capable of tool execution, the landscape of AI safety is shifting from content moderation to action security. However, existing red-teaming frameworks remain bifurcated: they either focus on rigid, script-based text attacks or lack the architectural modularity to simulate complex, multi-turn agentic exploitations. In this paper, we introduce AJAR (Adaptive Jailbreak Architecture for Red-teaming), a proof-of-concept framework designed to bridge this gap through Protocol-driven Cognitive Orchestration. Built upon the robust runtime of Petri, AJAR leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to decouple adversarial logic from the execution loop, encapsulating state-of-the-art algorithms like X-Teaming as standardized, plug-and-play services. We validate the architectural feasibility of AJAR through a controlled qualitative case study, demonstrating its ability to perform stateful backtracking within a tool-use environment. Furthermore, our preliminary exploration of the "Agentic Gap" reveals a complex safety dynamic: while tool usage introduces new injection vectors via code execution, the cognitive load of parameter formatting can inadvertently disrupt persona-based attacks. AJAR is open-sourced to facilitate the standardized, environment-aware evaluation of this emerging attack surface. The code and data are available at https://github.com/douyipu/ajar.

*Li Wang,Wenyu Chen,Ning Yu,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces VidLeaks, a framework to address copyright and privacy violations in Text-to-Video (T2V) models by using membership inference attacks to identify vulnerabilities in spatial and temporal memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of powerful Text-to-Video (T2V) systems trained on large datasets, concerns over copyright infringement and privacy breaches demand tools to assess and manage these risks.

Method: The authors propose VidLeaks, a framework employing two signals: Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF) to detect spatial memorization and Temporal Generative Stability (TGS) to identify temporal inconsistencies, tested under three black-box settings.

Result: VidLeaks shows high effectiveness in identifying memorization issues in T2V models, achieving AUC scores of 82.92% and 97.01% on two benchmark models, indicating significant privacy risks even under restricted conditions.

Conclusion: VidLeaks demonstrates that T2V models exhibit major vulnerabilities through sparse and temporal memorization, underlining the need for improved auditing practices and enhanced privacy defenses for such models.

Abstract: The proliferation of powerful Text-to-Video (T2V) models, trained on massive web-scale datasets, raises urgent concerns about copyright and privacy violations. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled tool for auditing such risks, yet existing techniques - designed for static data like images or text - fail to capture the spatio-temporal complexities of video generation. In particular, they overlook the sparsity of memorization signals in keyframes and the instability introduced by stochastic temporal dynamics. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of MIAs against T2V models and introduce a novel framework VidLeaks, which probes sparse-temporal memorization through two complementary signals: 1) Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF), using a Top-K similarity to amplify spatial memorization signals from sparsely memorized keyframes, and 2) Temporal Generative Stability (TGS), which measures semantic consistency across multiple queries to capture temporal leakage. We evaluate VidLeaks under three progressively restrictive black-box settings - supervised, reference-based, and query-only. Experiments on three representative T2V models reveal severe vulnerabilities: VidLeaks achieves AUC of 82.92% on AnimateDiff and 97.01% on InstructVideo even in the strict query-only setting, posing a realistic and exploitable privacy risk. Our work provides the first concrete evidence that T2V models leak substantial membership information through both sparse and temporal memorization, establishing a foundation for auditing video generation systems and motivating the development of new defenses.

*Aiman Al Masoud,Marco Arazzi,Antonino Nocera*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SD-RAG, a method enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation by addressing security and privacy risks with fine-grained controls during data retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address security and privacy risks in current RAG systems, particularly vulnerabilities like unauthorized sensitive information exposure and prompt injection attacks.

Method: The method involves a decoupled security model, applying sanitization and disclosure controls during the data retrieval phase and an optimized graph-based data model for context-aware fine-grained retrieval.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows SD-RAG achieves up to 58% improvement in privacy score and demonstrates resilience to prompt injection attacks.

Conclusion: SD-RAG effectively bolsters privacy and security in RAG systems while maintaining the generative performance through a novel approach to selective disclosure.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has attracted significant attention due to its ability to combine the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge obtained through efficient retrieval mechanisms over large-scale data collections. Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security and privacy threats posed by backdoored and privacy-leaking neural networks in machine learning systems.

Method: The approach utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules attached to a frozen backbone for probing optimization dynamics and representation shifts of suspicious samples.

Result: The framework can reliably detect poisoned samples and members through distinctive patterns in low-rank updates using simple ranking and statistical methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model-agnostic solution effectively provides security without relying on the original training data or modifying deployed models.

Abstract: Backdoored and privacy-leaking deep neural networks pose a serious threat to the deployment of machine learning systems in security-critical settings. Existing defenses for backdoor detection and membership inference typically require access to clean reference models, extensive retraining, or strong assumptions about the attack mechanism. In this work, we introduce a novel LoRA-based oracle framework that leverages low-rank adaptation modules as a lightweight, model-agnostic probe for both backdoor detection and membership inference.
  Our approach attaches task-specific LoRA adapters to a frozen backbone and analyzes their optimization dynamics and representation shifts when exposed to suspicious samples. We show that poisoned and member samples induce distinctive low-rank updates that differ significantly from those generated by clean or non-member data. These signals can be measured using simple ranking and energy-based statistics, enabling reliable inference without access to the original training data or modification of the deployed model.

*Rishi Mishra,Smriti,Balaji Srinivasan,Sundararajan Natarajan,Ganapathy Krishnamurthi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Null-Space Projected PIELM (NP-PIELM), a method to enforce exact boundary constraints in Physics-informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs) without relying on penalty terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs) struggle with only approximate enforcement of boundary conditions via penalty terms, leading to sensitivity to weights and error propagation in solutions.

Method: The paper proposes NP-PIELM, which uses algebraic projection in the coefficient space to enforce exact boundary constraints by exploiting the geometric structure of the coefficient manifold and focusing optimization in constraint-preserving directions.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that NP-PIELM effectively enforces boundary conditions in various scenarios, including complex geometries and mixed boundary conditions, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: NP-PIELM eliminates the drawbacks of penalty-based methods by achieving exact constraint enforcement, offering a robust and efficient framework for solving boundary condition problems in PIELMs.

Abstract: Physics-informed extreme learning machines (PIELMs) typically impose boundary and initial conditions through penalty terms, yielding only approximate satisfaction that is sensitive to user-specified weights and can propagate errors into the interior solution. This work introduces Null-Space Projected PIELM (NP-PIELM), achieving exact constraint enforcement through algebraic projection in coefficient space. The method exploits the geometric structure of the admissible coefficient manifold, recognizing that it admits a decomposition through the null space of the boundary operator. By characterizing this manifold via a translation-invariant representation and projecting onto the kernel component, optimization is restricted to constraint-preserving directions, transforming the constrained problem into unconstrained least-squares where boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at discrete collocation points. This eliminates penalty coefficients, dual variables, and problem-specific constructions while preserving single-shot training efficiency. Numerical experiments on elliptic and parabolic problems including complex geometries and mixed boundary conditions validate the framework.

*Xiaoyu Liang,Yuchen Peng,Jiale Luo,Wenhao Wang,Haoji Hu,Xincheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Learn Before Represent (LBR) framework to improve domain-specific representation learning in Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in domain-specific fields like chemistry and law due to semantic alignment limitations and lack of domain knowledge.

Method: The proposed LBR framework consists of two stages: (1) Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning to inject domain knowledge and compress semantics; (2) Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning for semantic alignment.

Result: Experiments in medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks demonstrated that LBR significantly outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The LBR framework addresses the bottleneck in domain-specific representation learning and provides a new paradigm for robust and accurate vertical domain modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) adapted via contrastive learning excel in general representation learning but struggle in vertical domains like chemistry and law, primarily due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge. This work identifies a core bottleneck: the prevailing ``LLM+CL'' paradigm focuses on semantic alignment but cannot perform knowledge acquisition, leading to failures on specialized terminology. To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building accurate and robust representations in vertical domains.

TL;DR: A semantic course recommendation system using BERT and contrastive learning to improve embedding accuracy for recommending relevant courses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BERT embeddings often show limitations in semantic relevance due to anisotropic representation spaces, which challenge course recommendation quality.

Method: The authors propose a self-supervised contrastive learning framework, incorporating data augmentation and isotropy regularization, to refine BERT embeddings for better semantic discrimination.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated improved embedding separation and outperformed standard BERT models in recommending relevant courses from a dataset of 500+ engineering courses.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned model effectively improves upon traditional BERT embeddings, resulting in more accurate and contextually relevant course recommendations for students.

Abstract: This paper presents a semantic course recommendation system for students using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach built upon BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Traditional BERT embeddings suffer from anisotropic representation spaces, where course descriptions exhibit high cosine similarities regardless of semantic relevance. To address this limitation, we propose a contrastive learning framework with data augmentation and isotropy regularization that produces more discriminative embeddings. Our system processes student text queries and recommends Top-N relevant courses from a curated dataset of over 500 engineering courses across multiple faculties. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model achieves improved embedding separation and more accurate course recommendations compared to vanilla BERT baselines.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Deep GraphRAG,' a framework enhancing graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with balanced hierarchical retrieval strategies and superior performance in natural question-answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in existing GraphRAG frameworks by achieving a balance between global comprehensiveness and local efficiency while ensuring robust multi-stage re-ranking and advanced integration.

Method: The proposed method introduces a three-stage hierarchical retrieval strategy: (1) inter-community filtering for pruning, (2) community-level refinement via entity-interaction, and (3) entity-level fine search. It incorporates a dynamic re-ranking module and a compact LLM trained with DW-GRPO reinforcement learning to balance relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness.

Result: Deep GraphRAG achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency when tested on Natural Questions and HotpotQA, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: Deep GraphRAG's balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval, dynamic re-ranking, and advanced knowledge integration demonstrates strong potential for large-scale question-answering tasks, bridging the gap between compact and large models.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) frameworks face a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of global search and the efficiency of local search. Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

### [288] [Cross-Modal Attention Network with Dual Graph Learning in Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11151)
*Ji Dai,Quan Fang,Jun Hu,Desheng Cai,Yang Yang,Can Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the inefficiencies in multimedia recommendation systems by introducing CRANE (Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding) to improve multimodal fusion and user representation, achieving significant improvements in recommendation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimedia recommendation systems face challenges with shallow modality fusion and asymmetric feature treatment, limiting their ability to effectively capture user preferences.

Method: The paper proposes CRANE, which includes a Recursive Cross-Modal Attention mechanism to refine modality features, constructs user multimodal profiles by aggregating interacted item features, and uses a dual-graph framework combining user-item interaction and item-item semantic graphs guided by contrastive learning.

Result: CRANE achieves scalability and efficiency, with theoretical and empirical analyses showing faster convergence on smaller datasets and superior performance on larger ones. It improves performance metrics by an average of 5% over state-of-the-art baselines across four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CRANE addresses critical limitations in multimodal recommendation systems by enhancing the integration of multimodal content and symmetric feature representation, significantly improving accuracy and scalability, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimedia recommendation systems leverage user-item interactions and multimodal information to capture user preferences, enabling more accurate and personalized recommendations. Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency. Theoretical and empirical analyses confirm its scalability and high practical efficiency, achieving faster convergence on small datasets and superior performance ceilings on large-scale ones. Comprehensive experiments on four public real-world datasets validate an average 5% improvement in key metrics over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [289] [From SERPs to Sound: How Search Engine Result Pages and AI-generated Podcasts Interact to Influence User Attitudes on Controversial Topics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11282)
*Junjie Wang,Gaole He,Alisa Rieger,Ujwal Gadiraju*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study explores the effects of AI-generated podcasts and SERPs on user opinions, focusing on controversial topics, sequence, and modality of exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the attitudinal impact of combining SERPs and AI-generated podcasts, especially in controversial and debated contexts.

Method: Conducted a user study with 483 participants, examining how the sequence and modality of information consumption affect user attitudes.

Result: Results showed that sequence influences attitude change, and viewpoint bias and topic controversiality play a role, while individual moderators had no significant effect.

Conclusion: AI-generated podcasts and SERPs impact attitudes, with sequence and bias being key factors.

Abstract: Compared to search engine result pages (SERPs), AI-generated podcasts represent a relatively new and relatively more passive modality of information consumption, delivering narratives in a naturally engaging format. As these two media increasingly converge in everyday information-seeking behavior, it is essential to explore how their interaction influences user attitudes, particularly in contexts involving controversial, value-laden, and often debated topics. Addressing this need, we aim to understand how information mediums of present-day SERPs and AI-generated podcasts interact to shape the opinions of users. To this end, through a controlled user study (N=483), we investigated user attitudinal effects of consuming information via SERPs and AI-generated podcasts, focusing on how the sequence and modality of exposure shape user opinions. A majority of users in our study corresponded to attitude change outcomes, and we found an effect of sequence on attitude change. Our results further revealed a role of viewpoint bias and the degree of topic controversiality in shaping attitude change, although we found no effect of individual moderators.

*Mayesha Maliha R. Mithila,Mylene C. Q. Farias*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DAGR-VQA enhances no-reference video quality assessment by integrating register tokens within a convolutional backbone for dynamic and temporally adaptive saliency prediction, outperforming baselines across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of no-reference video quality assessment lies in estimating perceptual quality without reference videos, especially given the limitations of existing global context analysis through static maps.

Method: Introduced DAGR-VQA, integrating register tokens directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal saliency prediction. It combines dynamic saliency maps with RGB data and utilizes a temporal transformer for perceptual video quality analysis.

Result: The model outperforms most benchmarks on datasets like LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC, achieving superior performance and exhibiting stable attention mechanisms through ablation studies.

Conclusion: DAGR-VQA delivers computational efficiency (387.7 FPS at 1080p) and achieves competitive performance, making it viable for real-time and multimedia streaming applications.

Abstract: No-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) estimates perceptual quality without a reference video, which is often challenging. While recent techniques leverage saliency or transformer attention, they merely address global context of the video signal by using static maps as auxiliary inputs rather than embedding context fundamentally within feature extraction of the video sequence. We present Dynamic Attention with Global Registers for Video Quality Assessment (DAGR-VQA), the first framework integrating register-token directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal, dynamic saliency prediction. By embedding learnable register tokens as global context carriers, our model enables dynamic, HVS-inspired attention, producing temporally adaptive saliency maps that track salient regions over time without explicit motion estimation. Our model integrates dynamic saliency maps with RGB inputs, capturing spatial data and analyzing it through a temporal transformer to deliver a perceptually consistent video quality assessment. Comprehensive tests conducted on the LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC datasets show that the performance is highly competitive, surpassing the majority of top baselines. Research on ablation studies demonstrates that the integration of register tokens promotes the development of stable and temporally consistent attention mechanisms. Achieving an efficiency of 387.7 FPS at 1080p, DAGR-VQA demonstrates computational performance suitable for real-time applications like multimedia streaming systems.

*Maiko Nagao,Kaito Urata,Atsushi Teramoto,Kazuyoshi Imaizumi,Masashi Kondo,Hiroshi Fujita*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study creates a visual question answering (VQA) dataset to assist in diagnosing pulmonary nodules on chest CT images by generating findings based on physician-posed questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic support for pulmonary nodules by offering interactive, question-based feedback rather than fixed descriptions.

Method: Chest CT images from the LIDC-IDRI dataset were used to extract regions of interest and create a VQA dataset pairing cropped images with questions and findings. A VQA model was fine-tuned for this purpose, and results were evaluated using language metrics like BLEU and CIDEr.

Result: The dataset enabled the generation of radiologic descriptions with a CIDEr score of 3.896, showing strong alignment with reference findings based on morphological characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively supports interactive diagnostic processes by generating image findings aligned with physicians' specific queries.

Abstract: Interpretation of imaging findings based on morphological characteristics is important for diagnosing pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) images. In this study, we constructed a visual question answering (VQA) dataset from structured data in an open dataset and investigated an image-finding generation method for chest CT images, with the aim of enabling interactive diagnostic support that presents findings based on questions that reflect physicians' interests rather than fixed descriptions. In this study, chest CT images included in the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) datasets were used. Regions of interest surrounding the pulmonary nodules were extracted from these images, and image findings and questions were defined based on morphological characteristics recorded in the database. A dataset comprising pairs of cropped images, corresponding questions, and image findings was constructed, and the VQA model was fine-tuned on it. Language evaluation metrics such as BLEU were used to evaluate the generated image findings. The VQA dataset constructed using the proposed method contained image findings with natural expressions as radiological descriptions. In addition, the generated image findings showed a high CIDEr score of 3.896, and a high agreement with the reference findings was obtained through evaluation based on morphological characteristics. We constructed a VQA dataset for chest CT images using structured information on the morphological characteristics from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Methods for generating image findings in response to these questions have also been investigated. Based on the generated results and evaluation metric scores, the proposed method was effective as an interactive diagnostic support system that can present image findings according to physicians' interests.

### [292] [Generation of Chest CT pulmonary Nodule Images by Latent Diffusion Models using the LIDC-IDRI Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11085)
*Kaito Urata,Maiko Nagao,Atsushi Teramoto,Kazuyoshi Imaizumi,Masashi Kondo,Hiroshi Fujita*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study proposes a method using Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) to generate chest CT nodule images, addressing data imbalance in clinical diagnosis, and confirms its ability to produce high-quality and diverse images comparable to real ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical diagnoses often suffer from data imbalance due to the rarity or complexity of specific cases, particularly in small cell carcinoma or rare benign tumors. This paper aims to tackle this issue by generating synthetic CT images with target medical features.

Method: The researchers utilized Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), specifically Stable Diffusion versions 1.5 and 2.0, fine-tuning them with paired nodule images and text prompts derived from physician evaluations in the LIDC-IDRI dataset. They fine-tuned the image generation guided by a parameter called guidance scale (GS) to balance fidelity with diversity.

Result: Evaluation revealed that Stable Diffusion version 2.0 (GS=5) performed best in terms of image quality, diversity, and text fidelity. Subjective and statistical tests confirmed that the synthetic images were indistinguishable from real clinical images.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable approach to generating diverse and high-quality CT images for underrepresented medical cases, with potential applications in augmenting training datasets for computer-aided diagnosis systems.

Abstract: Recently, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed to support diagnosis, but their performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to collect the large amount of CT images for specific cases, such as small cell carcinoma with low epidemiological incidence or benign tumors that are difficult to distinguish from malignant ones. This leads to the challenge of data imbalance. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a method to automatically generate chest CT nodule images that capture target features using latent diffusion models (LDM) and verified its effectiveness. Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we created pairs of nodule images and finding-based text prompts based on physician evaluations. For the image generation models, we used Stable Diffusion version 1.5 (SDv1) and 2.0 (SDv2), which are types of LDM. Each model was fine-tuned using the created dataset. During the generation process, we adjusted the guidance scale (GS), which indicates the fidelity to the input text. Both quantitative and subjective evaluations showed that SDv2 (GS = 5) achieved the best performance in terms of image quality, diversity, and text consistency. In the subjective evaluation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the generated images and real images, confirming that the quality was equivalent to real clinical images. We proposed a method for generating chest CT nodule images based on input text using LDM. Evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high-quality images that successfully capture specific medical features.

*Thomas D. Hull,Lizhe Zhang,Patricia A. Arean,Matteo Malgaroli*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study evaluated a generative AI chatbot for mental health support, showing significant improvements in mental health scores, social connection, and safety measures over 10 weeks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of generative AI chatbots in providing scalable, effective, and safe mental health support.

Method: A single arm observational study involving adults using the chatbot over 10 weeks, with repeated mental health measures, engagement analysis, and automated safety guardrails.

Result: Users showed significant reductions in mental health symptoms, improvements in social metrics, sustained results at follow-up, high user engagement, and safety mechanisms functioning effectively.

Conclusion: Generative AI chatbots demonstrate promise as accessible and effective tools for mental health support, warranting further exploration in real-world applications.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) chatbots built for mental health could deliver safe, personalized, and scalable mental health support. We evaluate a foundation model designed for mental health. Adults completed mental health measures while engaging with the chatbot between May 15, 2025 and September 15, 2025. Users completed an opt-in consent, demographic information, mental health symptoms, social connection, and self-identified goals. Measures were repeated every two weeks up to 6 weeks, and a final follow-up at 10 weeks. Analyses included effect sizes, and growth mixture models to identify participant groups and their characteristic engagement, severity, and demographic factors. Users demonstrated significant reductions in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 that were sustained at follow-up. Significant improvements in Hope, Behavioral Activation, Social Interaction, Loneliness, and Perceived Social Support were observed throughout and maintained at 10 week follow-up. Engagement was high and predicted outcomes. Working alliance was comparable to traditional care and predicted outcomes. Automated safety guardrails functioned as designed, with 76 sessions flagged for risk and all handled according to escalation policies. This single arm naturalistic observational study provides initial evidence that a GAI foundation model for mental health can deliver accessible, engaging, effective, and safe mental health support. These results lend support to findings from early randomized designs and offer promise for future study of mental health GAI in real world settings.

*Rachmadita Andreswari,Stephan A. Fahrenkrog-Petersen,Jan Mendling*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study proposes a process mining approach to assess fairness in emergency healthcare decision-making, analyzing empirical data from the MIMICEL event log and linking outcomes to justice theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare scenarios like emergency triage demand fast and equitable decisions. Fairness in automated processes is critical but lacks sufficient empirical exploration and connection to justice theories.

Method: The research uses process mining on MIMICEL event logs derived from MIMIC-IV ED. It evaluates age, gender, race, language, and insurance using statistical analyses (Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square, effect size measurements). Results are mapped to justice dimensions.

Result: The findings highlight aspects of possible unfairness in high-acuity and sub-acute healthcare processes, providing insights into justice-related disparities.

Conclusion: The study advances the development of fairness-aware process mining in healthcare by linking empirical analysis with justice theories, paving the way for further responsible research in this area.

Abstract: Fairness in automated decision-making has become a critical concern, particularly in high-pressure healthcare scenarios such as emergency triage, where fast and equitable decisions are essential. Process mining is increasingly investigating fairness. There is a growing area focusing on fairness-aware algorithms. So far, we know less how these concepts perform on empirical healthcare data or how they cover aspects of justice theory. This study addresses this research problem and proposes a process mining approach to assess fairness in triage by linking real-life event logs with conceptual dimensions of justice. Using the MIMICEL event log (as derived from MIMIC-IV ED), we analyze time, re-do, deviation and decision as process outcomes, and evaluate the influence of age, gender, race, language and insurance using the Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and effect size measurements. These outcomes are mapped to justice dimensions to support the development of a conceptual framework. The results demonstrate which aspects of potential unfairness in high-acuity and sub-acute surface. In this way, this study contributes empirical insights that support further research in responsible, fairness-aware process mining in healthcare.

### [295] [Epistemic Control and the Normativity of Machine Learning-Based Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11202)
*Emanuele Ratti*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper examines and challenges the pessimistic view that machine learning pushes humans out of the scientific process, offering a nuanced perspective on epistemic control in ML-based science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore concerns that machine learning may remove human scientists' control over the scientific process and to provide a refined framework to understand this issue.

Method: The author introduces and defines the concept of epistemic control through two conditions, tracking and tracing, and uses this framework to address existing critiques of machine learning in science.

Result: The analysis reveals flaws in Humphrey's pessimistic view, suggesting that while machine learning changes the nature of scientific inquiry, it does not eliminate epistemic control.

Conclusion: A nuanced view of epistemic control shows that while machine learning presents challenges, it does not fundamentally exclude humans from the loop of science.

Abstract: The past few years have witnessed an increasing use of machine learning (ML) systems in science. Paul Humphreys has argued that, because of specific characteristics of ML systems, human scientists are pushed out of the loop of science. In this chapter, I investigate to what extent this is true. First, I express these concerns in terms of what I call epistemic control. I identify two conditions for epistemic control, called tracking and tracing, drawing on works in philosophy of technology. With this new understanding of the problem, I then argue against Humphreys pessimistic view. Finally, I construct a more nuanced view of epistemic control in ML-based science.
