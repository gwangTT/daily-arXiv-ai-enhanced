### [1] [Majority Rules: LLM Ensemble is a Winning Approach for Content Categorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15714)
*Ariel Kamen,Yakov Kamen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ensemble framework for text categorization using multiple large language models (LLMs), achieving a significant performance boost and near human-level classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inherent weaknesses of individual language models, such as inconsistency, hallucinations, and misclassification, and improve text categorization performance.

Method: The authors introduced an ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework which combines multiple LLMs, using a formalized decision-making process and principled aggregation criteria.

Result: The eLLM framework outperformed single models, achieving up to a 65% improvement in F1-score while nearing human expert-level accuracy in taxonomy-based text classification.

Conclusion: The eLLM framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for text categorization, which reduces reliance on human expert labeling and enhances robustness in classification tasks.

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

*Yash Raj Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Graph-Memoized Reasoning, which enables persistent memory in reasoning systems by reusing reasoning workflows stored as graph-structured memory, optimizing computational efficiency and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning systems often redundantly recompute steps across tasks, which wastes resources, increases latency, and limits reproducibility. Persistent mechanisms are needed to recall and reuse computational traces.

Method: The proposed approach stores reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory, retrieves them through similarity metrics, and optimizes the trade-off between reasoning cost and workflow consistency.

Result: The conceptual framework allows compositional reuse of reasoning subgraphs, ensuring cost-efficient and consistent retrieval and reasoning.

Conclusion: This framework paves the way for interpretable and self-improving reasoning systems with persistent memory capabilities, enhancing efficiency and reproducibility in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

### [3] [From generative AI to the brain: five takeaways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16432)
*Claudius Gros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines generative AI principles and their potential relevance to neuroscience, highlighting how machine learning concepts can inform brain research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between advances in generative AI and cognitive neuroscience by investigating shared principles and insights.

Method: Discusses five key examples: world modeling, thought process generation, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization from machine learning research.

Result: Identifies ways neuroscience can benefit from machine learning insights, laying theoretical groundwork for interdisciplinary study.

Conclusion: Generative principles and ML characterizations hold significant promise for advancing neuroscience understanding and methodologies.

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

### [4] [MACIE: Multi-Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer for Collective Behavior Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15716)
*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MACIE, a novel framework for explaining Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) decisions using causal models, counterfactuals, and Shapley values, demonstrating accurate and efficient explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of understanding decisions and collective behaviors in safety-critical multi-agent systems where existing explainable AI methods fail to handle emergent behaviors and complex interactions.

Method: MACIE combines structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to quantify each agent's contributions, system-level emergence, and provides actionable natural language explanations.

Result: The evaluation of MACIE demonstrated precise outcome attribution, detection of emergent behaviors in collaborative tasks, efficient computation, and significant advances in multi-agent explanation.

Conclusion: MACIE effectively enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and accountability in MARL systems by rigorously quantifying causal contributions, emergent intelligence, and providing practical, interpretable explanations.

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

### [5] [How Modality Shapes Perception and Reasoning: A Study of Error Propagation in ARC-AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15717)
*Bo Wen,Chen Wang,Erhan Bilal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how different modalities (text and image) affect perception and reasoning in ARC-AGI tasks, finding that combining both modalities improves execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a principled account for understanding not only how modal encodings (like text or image) impact model perception but also how to disentangle errors caused by instruction versus execution.

Method: The research isolates perception from reasoning by testing nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline.

Result: Results show that structured text precisely identifies grid coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes influenced by resolution sensitivity, and combining modalities improves execution performance.

Conclusion: Aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and integrating text-image cross-validation leads to more accurate instructions and reliable execution without modifying the model.

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

### [6] [ToolMind Technical Report: A Large-Scale, Reasoning-Enhanced Tool-Use Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15718)
*Chen Yang,Ran Le,Yun Xing,Zhenwei An,Zongchao Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Yang Song,Tao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToolMind, a high-quality dataset to improve the performance of LLM agents in tool usage by addressing turn-level errors during data synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing challenges in LLM agent development include the scarcity of high-quality trajectories and overlooking turn-level errors that can degrade model performance.

Method: The authors propose a data synthesis pipeline involving function graphs, a multi-agent simulation framework, and fine-grained turn-level validation to create a robust ToolMind dataset.

Result: Models fine-tuned on ToolMind dataset display significant improvements on multiple benchmarks compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The ToolMind dataset, with its refined construction and validation processes, is effective in mitigating errors and enhancing LLM agent performance in tool usage scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

### [7] [CorrectHDL: Agentic HDL Design with LLMs Leveraging High-Level Synthesis as Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16395)
*Kangwei Xu,Grace Li Zhang,Ulf Schlichtmann,Bing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CorrectHDL, a framework to improve the functional correctness of HDL designs generated by LLMs using high-level synthesis results as references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome hallucinations in LLM-generated HDL designs, which can cause functional errors, and to enable efficient, correct IC design workflows.

Method: CorrectHDL uses C/C++ programs as input to create HDL designs via LLMs, repairs syntax errors through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and iteratively improves correctness by comparing simulations with HLS reference designs.

Result: Circuits produced by CorrectHDL maintain functional correctness while achieving significantly better area and power efficiency than traditional HLS tools and approaching human-engineered circuit quality.

Conclusion: CorrectHDL demonstrates the viability of coupling LLMs with traditional IC design flows to achieve efficient and correct HDL designs, bridging generative AI and correctness-driven workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

### [8] [Chain of Summaries: Summarization Through Iterative Questioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15719)
*William Brach,Lukas Galke Poech*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a summarization method called Chain of Summaries (CoS) to make complex web content more digestible for LLMs, by iteratively refining summaries inspired by Hegel's dialectical method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to process LLM-unfriendly web content due to formatting and context-length limitations.

Method: The CoS approach refines initial summaries (thesis) by identifying shortcomings (antithesis) and generating a synthesis summary, improving general-purpose usability.

Result: CoS achieves significant improvements in Q&A tasks, outperforming both zero-shot LLM baselines (by up to 66%) and specialized summarization methods (by up to 27%).

Conclusion: CoS enhances web content accessibility for LLMs, reduces token usage, and allows human oversight, making it useful for website maintainers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

### [9] [From Performance to Understanding: A Vision for Explainable Automated Algorithm Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16201)
*Niki van Stein,Anna V. Kononova,Thomas Bäck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into algorithm design for more interpretable, systematic, and explainable outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of understanding and explainability in LLM-generated algorithms hinders progress despite their rapid performance-driven advancements.

Method: The paper proposes a vision based on three pillars: LLM discovery of algorithm variants, explainable benchmarking, and connecting algorithm behavior to problem structures.

Result: This integrated approach aims to form a closed knowledge loop, combining discovery, explanation, and generalization for improved systematic algorithm design.

Conclusion: Shifting from opaque, automated searches to interpretable and problem-class specific algorithm development is essential for better insights and advancements in optimization strategies.

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

### [10] [Automated Hazard Detection in Construction Sites Using Large Language and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15720)
*Islem Sahraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The thesis proposes a multimodal AI framework combining textual and visual data analysis to enhance construction safety by identifying hazards on construction sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in synthesizing safety hazards from diverse formats of accident data, such as reports and site imagery, using traditional methods.

Method: Two case studies were conducted utilizing large language models (GPT 4o, GPT 4o mini) and vision-language models (Molmo 7B, Qwen2 VL 2B) for accident data analysis and violation detection.

Result: Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B, despite being lightweight, demonstrated competitive performance in certain configurations against proprietary models in construction safety monitoring.

Conclusion: Low-resource multimodal systems are feasible and effective for rule-aware construction site safety monitoring.

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

*Weichen Liu,Qiyao Xue,Haoming Wang,Xiangyu Yin,Boyuan Yang,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel taxonomy for classifying spatial intelligence tasks in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) from a cognitive perspective, emphasizing reasoning complexity and cognitive functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the persistent challenge of spatial reasoning in MLLMs and bridge the gap between model capabilities and human-like reasoning through a structured cognitive taxonomy.

Method: The authors map benchmarks across modalities to their taxonomy, review metrics for spatial reasoning, and analyze methods to improve spatial ability, considering both training and reasoning approaches.

Result: The analysis highlights gaps between current MLLM spatial reasoning abilities and human-style reasoning, emphasizing complementary strengths of training- and reasoning-based methods.

Conclusion: Their work provides researchers with a comprehensive understanding of spatial reasoning in MLLMs, actionable insights, and directions for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

### [12] [Uncertainty-Resilient Multimodal Learning via Consistency-Guided Cross-Modal Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15741)
*Hyo-Jeong Jang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of noisy data and heterogeneous modality in multimodal learning by proposing a framework for consistency-guided cross-modal transfer, improving model robustness and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle issues of uncertainty in multimodal learning caused by noisy data, variable quality, and inconsistency, especially in human-computer interaction scenarios.

Method: The method involves using cross-modal semantic consistency to project heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, enabling robust representation learning and uncertainty estimation.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noise on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks through latent space analysis.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision offers a unified approach to resilient multimodal learning, beneficial for brain-computer interface systems.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

### [13] [Build AI Assistants using Large Language Models and Agents to Enhance the Engineering Education of Biomechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15752)
*Hanzhi Yan,Qin Lu,Xianqiao Wang,Xiaoming Zhai,Tianming Liu,He Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) and AI agents to create educational assistants for biomechanics courses. It introduces a dual-module framework to address conceptual and calculation challenges, showing improved performance compared to vanilla LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with domain-specific applications and complex tasks requiring detailed reasoning, making them less effective as educational tools in specialized fields like biomechanics.

Method: The paper uses two approaches: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve conceptual question responses and a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to tackle multi-step reasoning in calculation-oriented tasks.

Result: RAG considerably increases specificity and logical consistency for conceptual questions, while MAS performs multi-step reasoning and calculates explainable solutions reliably in biomechanics education tasks.

Conclusion: The integration of RAG and MAS into LLMs shows promise in engineering education by enhancing performance in domain-specific tasks, suggesting effective intelligent tutoring applications.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

*Philip Drammeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MyAntFarm.ai, a framework that utilizes multi-agent orchestration to vastly improve the quality of LLM-based incident response recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the deficiencies in single-agent LLM-based incident response systems, notably their vague and often unusable recommendations, by exploring multi-agent orchestration.

Method: The authors conducted 348 controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of single-agent and multi-agent systems on identical scenarios, introducing Decision Quality (DQ) as a new metric for evaluation.

Result: Multi-agent systems achieved a 100% actionable recommendation rate compared to 1.7% with single-agent systems, significantly improving solution correctness and reducing quality variance.

Conclusion: The research establishes multi-agent orchestration as essential for production-ready LLM-based incident response systems, offering significant advantages in recommendation quality and reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Motivation: The paper seeks to address the gap in systematically assessing risks linked to AI supply chains, particularly in crucial sectors like food, healthcare, and law, where AI's complexity and potential risks pose challenges.

Method: The study surveys current AI risk assessment and governance approaches, proposing a taxonomy for categorizing AI supply chain entities to improve understanding and systematic risk management.

Result: The survey presents a taxonomy that enables stakeholders to inventory dependencies within AI systems systematically, particularly aiding those with limited AI expertise.

Conclusion: This contribution bridges existing AI governance limitations, providing a structured way to assess and manage AI-related risks, especially in critical applications.

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares NLP rule-based methods with Large Language Models (LLMs) for extracting information from Polish EHRs. It finds rule-based methods to be more accurate for demographic details, while LLMs are more adaptable and better in drug name recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text in resource-constrained, non-English healthcare contexts.

Method: The study evaluates rule-based NLP methods and LLMs for extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and medications from Polish EHRs, analyzing both original and translated texts.

Result: Rule-based methods excel in accuracy, especially for demographic data like age and sex, while LLMs are more adaptable and effective in tasks like drug name recognition. Translation-induced information loss was also assessed.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining the precision of rule-based systems and the adaptability of LLMs is proposed as a practical solution for clinical NLP in non-English healthcare settings.

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

*Tuan-Anh Le,Anh Mai Vu,David Yang,Akash Awasthi,Hien Van Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IMACT-CXR is a tutoring system for chest X-ray analysis that combines spatial, textual, and reasoning tools to enhance learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive and interactive learning tool for trainees in interpreting chest X-rays, improving localization and diagnostic reasoning.

Method: IMACT-CXR integrates gaze tracking, spatial annotation, and reasoning with tools like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, TensorFlow U-Net for segmentation, and multiple agents that assist with image reasoning and knowledge retrieval.

Result: The system provides responsive and precise tutoring flows, with preliminary evaluations showing better localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: IMACT-CXR is a promising interactive tutor for chest X-ray analysis, demonstrating potential for real-world use in medical residency training to advance learning outcomes.

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

TL;DR: The study introduces Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), a simulator for evaluating AI decision-making in complex, dynamic environments, showing that humans significantly outperform current AI systems in various capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human-AI benchmarks fail to assess holistic decision-making under real-world constraints, such as long-term planning, learning from sparse data, and spatial reasoning.

Method: The study created MAPs, an amusement-park simulation environment that integrates multi-faceted challenges for testing agents’ decision-making and compares human performance with state-of-the-art large language models.

Result: Humans outperform AI systems by 6.5x in 'easy' mode and 9.8x in 'medium' mode within the MAPs framework. Persistent deficiencies were identified in the AI's long-horizon planning and reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: MAPs unifies complex decision-making challenges into a single benchmark environment, serving as a novel tool for advancing and assessing adaptable AI systems in dynamic contexts.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

TL;DR: Step-Audio-R1 introduces reasoning capabilities to audio models, outperforming existing systems and proving reasoning as transformative for audio intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio models typically perform better without reasoning, prompting exploration into whether deliberate thinking enhances audio intelligence.

Method: Introduced Step-Audio-R1 using the Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework to create reasoning chains grounded in acoustic features.

Result: Step-Audio-R1 outperformed Gemini 2.5 Pro and matched Gemini 3 Pro in various audio reasoning benchmarks, validating reasoning's effectiveness in the audio domain.

Conclusion: Step-Audio-R1 proves reasoning can enhance audio intelligence and opens opportunities for truly multimodal reasoning systems across sensory modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

*Alexander Zadorojniy,Segev Wasserkrug,Eitan Farchi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an agent-based method for validating optimization models generated by LLMs, focusing on their accuracy in alignment with requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs for generating optimization models raises concerns over their correctness and requirement compliance. Addressing this gap in validation is crucial.

Method: An agent-based framework involving generation of a testing API, test creation, and model-specific mutations is proposed. Mutation coverage, a software testing metric, is used to assess validation quality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate high-quality validation performance by the proposed agent ensemble, as measured by mutation coverage.

Conclusion: The framework effectively validates optimization models, ensuring their accuracy and reliability while extending traditional software testing approaches.

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

*Ivan Chulo,Ananya Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Activation steering improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) by enhancing emotional understanding while suppressing analytical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms in LLMs that enable improved Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities after activation steering.

Method: The authors used linear probes on 45 cognitive actions to compare steered vs. baseline LLMs and applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to assess belief attribution scenarios.

Result: Gemma-3-4B showed improved ToM performance from 32.5% to 46.7% accuracy, mediated by increased emotional processing and decreased analytical reasoning.

Conclusion: Effective ToM in language models is primarily driven by emotional understanding rather than analytical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-correcting framework for large language models to detect and reduce hallucinations using uncertainty signals during multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of hallucinations and unreliable reasoning in large language models by incorporating mechanisms for real-time detection and correction.

Method: The framework leverages self-assessed confidence alignment and token-level entropy spikes to monitor reasoning reliability. A reinforcement learning policy, guided by a composite reward function, penalizes misleading confidence and entropy anomalies while promoting stable reasoning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy of final answers and better calibrated reasoning. Individual contributions of different signals were validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances both the accuracy and coherence of reasoning steps in large language models, making them more reliable and introspective.

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces JudgeBoard, an evaluation pipeline for assessing answers directly using models and proposes a MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging) framework to improve small language models' (SLMs) judging accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and improve the evaluation ability of small language models (SLMs) in reasoning tasks, as previous methods rely on indirect comparison approaches often limited in automation and scalability.

Method: The authors propose JudgeBoard, a direct evaluation method for models, along with MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), which leverages multiple collaborating SLMs to improve judgment accuracy.

Result: Results highlight significant judgment performance gaps between SLMs and large language models (LLMs), but the MAJ framework significantly improves SLM consistency, with smaller models sometimes matching or outperforming larger counterparts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of multi-agent SLM systems to match or exceed LLMs in judgment tasks, making scalable and efficient assessment achievable.

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KRAL, a paradigm enhancing local LLMs for clinical antimicrobial therapy, tackling gaps in knowledge, reasoning, and costs compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making in antimicrobial therapy is complex, requiring improved LLMs that address knowledge gaps, data privacy, cost concerns, and reasoning limitations.

Method: KRAL integrates teacher-model reasoning through reverse answer-to-question generation, heuristic learning for data augmentation, and agentic reinforcement learning for knowledge and reasoning optimization.

Result: KRAL outperformed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in external benchmarks, with notable gains in accuracy and reasoning, achieved at a fraction of the cost.

Conclusion: KRAL is a scalable, cost-effective, privacy-preserving solution for enhancing LLMs' capabilities in clinical diagnostics, facilitating safe and affordable deployment in medical decision support.

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time detection system for identifying backdoored Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of practical methods for detecting malicious backdoors in LLMs, which compromise security but remain hidden through safety training.

Method: The authors propose a dual-method system using Sentence-BERT embeddings to track semantic drift and injected canary questions to ensure response consistency.

Result: The detection system is validated on a sleeper agent model (Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B), achieving 92.5% accuracy, 100% precision, and 85% recall in real-time performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient, accurate, and practical solution for detecting backdoors in LLMs, filling a significant gap in AI security measures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper examines the reasoning deficiencies of large language models (LLMs) in structured clinical contexts, proposing evaluation frameworks to better assess reasoning quality alongside retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between evidence retrieval and reasoning accuracy in high-stakes settings, particularly clinical applications such as Written Exposure Therapy (WET).

Method: The study uses WET guidelines and clinician-vetted questions to assess LLM outputs, proposing a new evaluation framework that looks at accuracy, consistency, and fidelity in reasoning.

Result: Findings reveal persistent reasoning errors despite authoritative evidence being provided, showcasing the risks and need for cautious deployment of RAG systems in clinical settings.

Conclusion: Safe and effective use of LLMs in clinical applications requires robust evaluation mechanisms for both retrieval and reasoning to minimize risks.

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Method: MuseKG integrates structured and unstructured data using symbolic-neural techniques, creating a typed property graph for querying with natural language inputs.

Result: Evaluations showed MuseKG outperforms zero-shot, few-shot, and SPARQL prompt models in querying attributes, relations, and entities.

Conclusion: MuseKG facilitates enhanced integration and reasoning for cultural heritage data at web scale, emphasizing symbolic grounding for robust performance.

Abstract: Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data.

We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

*Jorge A. Huertas,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel CP model for s-batch scheduling, which avoids existing reliance on predefined virtual sets, improving performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CP models for s-batch scheduling suffer from high complexity due to reliance on predefined virtual batch sets and fail to efficiently handle practical scenarios with minimum batch size constraints.

Method: The novel CP model directly reasons on sequences of same-family jobs without using predefined virtual batch sets, enhancing formulation compactness. Tailored search strategies and strengthened constraint inference are also integrated.

Result: Extensive experiments on approx. 5,000 instances show the model outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 25% better solutions for large-scale cases (500 jobs, 10 families, 10 machines).

Conclusion: The proposed CP model demonstrates superior efficiency and solution quality compared to existing methods, especially for small-to-large s-batch scheduling problems in practical applications.

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

Motivation: To understand and adapt to the transformative effects of GenAI and LLMs on accounting research, which are creating opportunities as well as challenges for scholars.

Method: A framework is used to classify AI-accounting research based on focus and methodology, analyzing recent research and comparing capabilities of human and AI in the research workflow.

Result: The paper maps current AI-accounting studies and identifies collaborative opportunities, illustrating where human judgment and creativity remain essential.

Conclusion: Generative AI reshapes expectations in accounting research, necessitating reforms in doctoral education for scholars to build AI fluency and leverage their expertise effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

### [32] [A Hybrid Proactive And Predictive Framework For Edge Cloud Resource Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16075)
*Hrikshesh Kumar,Anika Garg,Anshul Gupta,Yashika Agarwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a proactive cloud edge workload resource management system using a hybrid architecture of CNN LSTM-based forecasting and multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to balance cost and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cloud edge resource management relies on reactive approaches with static thresholds, leading to either overspending or degraded performance. The paper aims to solve these issues by proposing a proactive solution.

Method: A hybrid system integrates CNN LSTM for time series forecasting and multi-agent DRL. The novelty lies in embedding predictive forecasts from the CNN LSTM into the DRL agent's state space for smarter decision-making.

Result: The proposed system outperforms traditional methods by effectively handling complex decisions and achieving an optimal trade-off between cost savings, reliability, and performance.

Conclusion: The integrated framework enables forward-looking and efficient resource management, ensuring a smooth and balanced system operation.

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

*Shiyi Cao,Dacheng Li,Fangzhou Zhao,Shuo Yuan,Sumanth R. Hegde,Connor Chen,Charlie Ruan,Tyler Griggs,Shu Liu,Eric Tang,Richard Liaw,Philipp Moritz,Matei Zaharia,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SkyRL-Agent is a framework enabling efficient multi-turn agent training. It advances reinforcement learning by optimizing dispatching and tool integration, demonstrated through SA-SWE-32B, which achieves high performance in software engineering tasks at reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance reinforcement learning for agents tackling long-horizon, multi-turn tasks. By addressing inefficiencies in training pipelines and improving tool integration, the framework seeks to provide scalable solutions for diverse applications.

Method: SkyRL-Agent introduces an efficient asynchronous pipeline dispatcher and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool. SA-SWE-32B, a model trained only on software engineering tasks, showcases this optimization, achieving impressive performance and cost efficiency.

Result: SA-SWE-32B achieves 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to similar performers. It generalizes effectively to other tasks like Terminal-Bench and BrowseComp-Plus, and demonstrates SkyRL-Agent’s success across different backends.

Conclusion: SkyRL-Agent provides a versatile and extensible platform for reinforcement-learning-based agent training, offering significant efficiency and generalization improvements. Its innovations make it suitable for a wide range of applications beyond its primary focus.

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

*Yongnan Jin,Xurui Li,Feng Cao,Liucun Gao,Juanjuan Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses alignment challenges for large language models in medical applications and introduces MR-RML—an innovative framework with a structured scoring system and geometric constraints to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in the clinical application of LLMs, such as inability to meet dynamic cognitive needs, adapt to evolving medical standards, and capture nuanced medical quality criteria.

Method: The authors propose MR-RML, which includes (1) a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" system embedding domain standards, (2) a multi-dimensional reward model for internalized scoring, and (3) geometric projection reference constraints for aligning clinical reasoning.

Result: MR-RML demonstrates significant performance improvements on the Healthbench benchmark, achieving substantial increases in accuracy and State-of-the-Art (SOTA) scores compared to existing LLMs.

Conclusion: The integration of MR-RML addresses key challenges in aligning LLMs to medical practice, offering a scalable solution for enhancing their consistency, reasoning, and clinical utility.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

*Jeremie Ochin,Raphael Chekroun,Bogdan Stanciulescu,Sotiris Manitsaris*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOOTPASS, a dataset designed to benchmark the extraction of detailed play-by-play data in soccer matches using computer vision and tactical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods are insufficient to fully automate annotations for soccer analytics due to complex requirements like integrating spatiotemporal action detection and multi-object tracking.

Method: FOOTPASS benchmarks play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches, leveraging multi-modal, player-centric, and tactical knowledge for reliable computer-vision-based predictions.

Result: The dataset facilitates methods that use computer vision outputs and tactical prior knowledge for extracting structured play-by-play data, enhancing sports analytics.

Conclusion: FOOTPASS advances automated sports data extraction by combining computer vision and tactical insights, supporting more reliable and comprehensive soccer analytics methods.

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

*Pei Yang,Ke Zhang,Ji Wang,Xiao Chen,Yuxin Tang,Eric Yang,Lynn Ai,Bill Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CRM introduces a framework that breaks down reward modeling into specialized evaluators for robustness and interpretability in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), using an aggregator to coordinate their output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reward models struggle with optimizing conflicting dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and lack transparency behind score assignment.

Method: CRM employs domain-specific agents for evaluating preference dimensions, incorporates global evaluators, and uses a centralized aggregator for fusion. A benchmark suite named rewardBench supports training and assessment.

Result: CRM produces a single robust training reward compatible with RL pipelines, reducing dependency on additional human annotations and enabling multi-perspective reward shaping.

Conclusion: CRM and rewardBench contribute to transparent reward modeling and stable RL optimization, helping address challenges in multi-dimensional preference evaluation.

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChemO, a benchmark for chemistry problems based on the International Chemistry Olympiad. It also presents ChemLabs, a multi-agent framework that achieves near-perfect performance, surpassing human gold medal levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in AI benchmarks for advanced reasoning in chemistry, specifically targeting its unique multimodal, symbolic challenges.

Method: The authors developed ChemO with two innovations: (1) Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts visual problem components into computational formats, and (2) Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE) to separate visual perception from reasoning. They also proposed a hierarchical multi-agent framework, ChemLabs, for solving the benchmark.

Result: The ChemLabs framework, when combined with SVE, achieved a score of 93.6 out of 100 on the ChemO benchmark, outperforming human gold medalists.

Conclusion: The research sets a new standard in automated chemical problem-solving and highlights the potential of specialized multi-agent approaches in complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting aligned QA/VQA pairs from educational documents to improve reasoning-oriented LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high cost and limitations of existing supervised datasets for LLMs by leveraging underused human-authored educational materials.

Method: Combining layout-aware OCR and LLM-based semantic parsing to extract well-formed QA and VQA pairs from raw PDFs.

Result: The proposed method generates accurate and low-noise QA/VQA pairs from diverse educational documents.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable utilization of real-world educational data as an alternative to synthetic datasets, enhancing reasoning-oriented LLM training.

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies in multimodal reasoning, enabling scalable and effective research.

Method: A two-stage training framework: supervised fine-tuning using an 874K-sample dataset, followed by reinforcement learning on a 74K-sample dataset to enhance reasoning performance.

Result: Significant improvements in multimodal reasoning, with an 11.6% enhancement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine benchmarks.

Conclusion: OpenMMReasoner highlights the importance of quality data and well-designed training strategies, establishing a robust foundation for future research in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

*Yun Lu,Xiaoyu Shi,Hong Xie,Chongjun Xia,Zhenhui Gong,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lifecycle-aware reinforcement learning framework to address fairness in interactive recommendations, improving fairness and user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns in interactive recommendation systems by considering item lifecycles and how they deviate from traditional models.

Method: The paper introduces LHRL, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that incorporates phase detection (via PhaseFormer) and phase-specific fairness constraints in its two-level decision-making policies.

Result: LHRL improves both fairness and user engagement on multiple real-world datasets, and integrating lifecycle-aware rewards enhances existing models.

Conclusion: The lifecycle-aware approach is effective for harmonizing fairness and accuracy, and it is generalizable across various recommendation systems.

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

### [41] [TOFA: Training-Free One-Shot Federated Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16423)
*Li Zhang,Zhongxuan Han,XiaoHua Feng,Jiaming Zhang,Yuyuan Li,Linbo Jiang,Jianan Lin,Chaochao Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes TOFA, a training-free one-shot federated adaptation framework for pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing challenges like multimodal exploitation, data heterogeneity, and resource minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning adaptation methods incur high communication costs and are prone to attacks. One-shot techniques offer a promising solution but lack efficient multimodal exploitation, strategies for data heterogeneity, and lightweight resource requirement.

Method: TOFA uses visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations, employs a hierarchical Bayesian model for visual prototypes, aligns text prompts globally for robustness, and introduces adaptive weight calibration to balance predictions.

Result: TOFA demonstrates effectiveness through extensive experimentation across 9 datasets under various federated settings, showcasing improved adaptation and handling of data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: TOFA provides a novel, training-free method for one-shot federated adaptation of VLMs, improving communication efficiency, robustness, and adaptation capabilities in heterogeneous federated settings.

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

*Zhiyuan Li,Haisheng Yu,Guangchuan Guo,Nan Zhou,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark and framework to improve RAG systems for multi-intent scientific queries, enhancing evidence retrieval and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of conventional RAG systems that are typically designed for single-intent queries and fail to achieve comprehensive evidence coverage in multi-intent scientific questions.

Method: An intent-aware retrieval framework is proposed. It uses LLMs to hypothesize answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, retrieve relevant passages, and re-rank evidence using Reciprocal Rank Fusion to balance coverage while reducing redundancy.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms traditional methods in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage, as demonstrated on both the MuISQA benchmark and other RAG datasets.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more effective way to handle multi-intent scientific questions by leveraging intent-aware mechanisms and achieving superior performance in evidence retrieval.

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a prototype for decentralized agent-to-agent communication using natural-language messages without shared identifiers or centralized data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore secure inter-organizational cooperation via decentralized agents while preserving privacy and eliminating the need for shared schemas or centralized data.

Method: The study uses the Orpius platform to facilitate communication through pseudonymized tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operation boundaries. Agents communicate via natural-language OperationRelay calls, relying on their own datasets.

Result: The prototype demonstrates the feasibility of decentralized communication and reasoning among agents while maintaining data privacy, though it lacks clinical validation or extensive evaluation.

Conclusion: The prototype highlights patterns for privacy-preserving communication and suggests opportunities for rigorous validation and research in decentralized multi-agent systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: D-GARA is a new benchmarking framework developed to evaluate the robustness of Android GUI agents against real-world anomalies like interruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in existing static and idealized benchmarks for GUI agents, which fail to reflect real-world complexities and anomalies such as interruptions.

Method: The authors created D-GARA, a dynamic and modular benchmarking framework that introduces real-world anomalies like permission dialogs and battery warnings, targeting robust evaluation of Android GUI agents.

Result: D-GARA reveals a significant performance drop in state-of-the-art GUI agents when operating in environments with anomalies, advocating the need for improved learning methods.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of robustness in GUI agents and provides D-GARA as a flexible tool for enabling further research in this domain.

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

TL;DR: The paper discusses addressing trust issues in AI workflows by introducing an agent-first lakehouse design for trustworthy agentic workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the trust deficit enterprises have in deploying agents to production data by addressing the shortcomings in traditional lakehouse infrastructure.

Method: The authors propose an agent-first architecture called 'Bauplan' which reimplements data and compute isolation by drawing principles from MVCC in databases but adapting them for an agent-first environment.

Result: The proposed design, Bauplan, enables a self-healing pipeline that integrates agent reasoning while maintaining correctness and trust.

Conclusion: By implementing an agent-first lakehouse architecture, the authors provide a pathway to establish trust in deploying AI agents, ensuring infrastructure provides guarantees for correctness and confidence in workflows.

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

### [47] [Pharos-ESG: A Framework for Multimodal Parsing, Contextual Narration, and Hierarchical Labeling of ESG Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16417)
*Yan Chen,Yu Zou,Jialei Zeng,Haoran You,Xiaorui Zhou,Aixi Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Pharos-ESG, a unified framework that structures ESG reports for enhanced understanding and Aurora-ESG, a dataset supporting ESG integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of ESG principles into global financial systems is hindered by the chaotic and weakly structured nature of ESG reports, creating challenges in large-scale comprehension.

Method: Pharos-ESG is proposed to transform ESG reports into structured data using multimodal parsing, layout flow, hierarchy-aware segmentation, and multimodal aggregation, enriched with relevant ESG and sentiment labels.

Result: Pharos-ESG consistently outperformed existing document parsing systems and multimodal models in experiments. Aurora-ESG, a large-scale ESG report dataset, supports better ESG research and financial decision-making.

Conclusion: Pharos-ESG enhances the structured comprehension of ESG reports and facilitates better decision-making. The release of the Aurora-ESG dataset establishes a valuable resource for ESG-focused financial analysis.

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

### [48] [PersonaDrift: A Benchmark for Temporal Anomaly Detection in Language-Based Dementia Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16445)
*Joy Lai,Alex Mihailidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark to evaluate machine learning methods for tracking communication changes in people living with dementia (PLwD). It simulates interaction logs based on caregiver interviews with a focus on two types of behavioral drifts: flattened sentiment and off-topic replies. Statistical and machine learning methods were tested, showing personalized classifiers perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of computational tools capable of tracking progressive communication behavior changes in PLwD, which are subtle and often noticed informally by caregivers.

Method: The authors developed PersonaDrift, a benchmark simulating 60-day communication logs of synthetic personas informed by caregiver interviews. The benchmark incorporated changes in sentiment and topic drift at varying rates, and evaluated machine learning/statistical anomaly detection methods.

Result: Flattened sentiment detection was achievable with simple statistical models for users with low variability, while semantic drift required temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Personalized classifiers outperformed generalized ones across tasks.

Conclusion: PersonaDrift provides an innovative framework for studying behavioral drift in PLwD, emphasizing the importance of personalized analysis. It shows promise for extending methods to detect additional behaviors in the future.

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

*Guanchen Wu,Yuzhang Xie,Huanwei Wu,Zhe He,Hui Shao,Xiao Hu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLOZE, a framework using large language models (LLMs) to extract and integrate medical entities from clinical notes into hierarchical ontologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the coverage and utility of medical ontologies for research and clinical applications by extending them using underutilized clinical notes.

Method: CLOZE employs zero-shot large language models to extract medical entities and relationships from clinical notes and integrate them into medical ontologies, while removing sensitive information.

Result: Experimental results show CLOZE is accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving, capable of extracting medical concepts and integrating them efficiently.

Conclusion: CLOZE presents a promising framework to extend medical ontologies, providing scalable and privacy-conscious solutions for biomedical and clinical use cases.

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

*Andres Campero,Derek Shiller,Jaan Aru,Jonathan Simon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a taxonomical framework to classify challenges against the possibility of consciousness in digital AI systems, identifying granularity and disambiguating challenge degrees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to clarify and provide structure to the complex and often ambiguous debates surrounding digital AI consciousness challenges.

Method: They propose a taxonomy based on Marr's levels and categorize challenges by their degree of force, applying it to 14 examples from scientific and philosophical perspectives.

Result: The framework successfully disambiguates and structures various arguments about digital consciousness, offering clarity to ongoing debates.

Conclusion: This tool benefits researchers by helping to distinguish arguments against computational functionalism, improbability, or impossibility claims regarding digital AI consciousness.

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

*Jules Soria,Zakaria Chihani,Julien Girard-Satabin,Alban Grastien,Romain Xu-Darme,Daniela Cancila*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formalism named Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs) to address misleading explanations in case-based reasoning networks, improving their reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Case-based reasoning networks provide explanations by design, but these explanations can be misleading, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors propose ALEs, a framework for providing sufficient latent representation conditions to ensure predictions, and develop a scalable, solver-free algorithm to generate these explanations.

Result: The proposed ALE method is demonstrated to be feasible and effective on various datasets, including standard and fine-grained image classification.

Conclusion: ALEs enhance the interpretability and reliability of case-based reasoning networks by addressing their potential for misleading explanations, making them more suitable for sensitive applications.

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

### [52] [You Only Forward Once: An Efficient Compositional Judging Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16600)
*Tianlong Zhang,Hongwei Xue,Shilin Yan,Di Wu,Chen Xu,Yunyun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: YOFO is proposed to optimize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for efficient and fine-grained judgment making, using a single forward pass binary decision mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs face challenges in balancing single-score adaptation and fine-grained understanding. There is also inefficiency in autoregressively generating judging analyses in high-throughput scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce YOFO, a template-conditioned method that uses structured requirement templates in an autoregressive model to produce binary yes/no decisions for multiple requirements in one inference step.

Result: YOFO delivers state-of-the-art results on recommendation datasets, offers dependency-aware analysis based on sequential judgments, and benefits from post-hoc chain-of-thought reasoning, with significant speed improvements.

Conclusion: YOFO successfully balances efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations in existing MLLMs while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a framework addressing data scarcity and algorithmic inefficiency in embodied intelligence systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data for embodied intelligence systems is limited and costly, and current methods are computationally inefficient.

Method: The DPPO framework alternates between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to maximize learning efficiency using sparse data. The process identifies weaknesses and allocates resources dynamically.

Result: Training a model using DPPO results in a 20.3% performance improvement, outperforming open-source alternatives by 10.6%.

Conclusion: DPPO effectively overcomes data and resource limitations for embodied systems. The authors have released models and code for community use.

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

*Elias Hossain,Md Mehedi Hasan Nipu,Maleeha Sheikh,Rajib Rana,Subash Neupane,Niloofar Yousefi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian framework for transformers in clinical applications, significantly enhancing uncertainty quantification and reducing overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of transformers being overconfident in ambiguous clinical scenarios, where uncertainty-aware predictions are crucial for decision support in medical AI.

Method: MedBayes-Lite embeds three components into transformer pipelines: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping, all without additional layers or retraining.

Result: MedBayes-Lite improves calibration and trustworthiness by reducing overconfidence (32-48%), and mitigates diagnostic errors in clinical simulations by flagging uncertain cases.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances reliability, uncertainty propagation, and interpretability, making it suitable for clinical decision support applications.

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance trading profitability and risk management in the Forex market by integrating comprehensive macroeconomic and technical indicators into an AI-based trading system.

Method: The system uses key economic data from the Euro Zone and the US, combined with technical tools, to build and evaluate a machine learning-based predictive trading model. The algorithm’s performance is analyzed through predictive accuracy metrics and historical backtesting simulations.

Result: The algorithm was tested for predictive reliability and profitability, including comparative analysis to identify whether fundamental or technical features drive better outcomes.

Conclusion: The study identifies the most effective predictive indicators for profitable algorithmic trading within the high-frequency Forex market.

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

TL;DR: This paper compares how humans and language models reason, using insights from cognitive science and analyzing reasoning data from models and humans. Authors also propose a framework to improve LLM performance through cognitive guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models struggle with certain reasoning tasks and develop principled methods to improve their reasoning capabilities based on cognitive science theories.

Method: A taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements was created, and 170K reasoning traces from 17 models and 54 humans were analyzed. Meta-analysis of relevant research papers and a cognitive evaluation framework were also proposed. Researchers used insights to develop test-time reasoning guidance for models.

Result: The study found that humans use hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring, while models rely on shallow forward chaining. Leveraging cognitive patterns, the authors significantly improved model performance on complex reasoning problems by up to 60%.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that integrating cognitive mechanisms into large language models enables more principled reasoning, providing a pathway for enhancing their capabilities and advancing cognitive science research.

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: CIMinus framework is proposed for cost modeling of sparse DNN workloads on CIM architectures, addressing challenges in exploiting sparsity and dataflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in using sparsity within CIM systems and unify the modeling approach for diverse sparse DNN workloads, considering the complexities in mapping strategies and sparsity patterns.

Method: The paper introduces a framework named CIMinus that facilitates cost modeling, analyzing energy consumption, and latency, validating it against existing CIM systems and applying it in use-cases.

Result: CIMinus is validated with contemporary CIM architectures and provides insights into sparsity patterns and mapping strategies' effectiveness in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: CIMinus bridges theoretical and practical gaps in sparse DNN workloads on CIM systems, enabling systematic modeling and optimization of sparsity exploitation.

Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) has emerged as a pivotal direction for accelerating workloads in the field of machine learning, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the effective exploitation of sparsity in CIM systems presents numerous challenges, due to the inherent limitations in their rigid array structures. Designing sparse DNN dataflows and developing efficient mapping strategies also become more complex when accounting for diverse sparsity patterns and the flexibility of a multi-macro CIM structure. Despite these complexities, there is still an absence of a unified systematic view and modeling approach for diverse sparse DNN workloads in CIM systems. In this paper, we propose CIMinus, a framework dedicated to cost modeling for sparse DNN workloads on CIM architectures. It provides an in-depth energy consumption analysis at the level of individual components and an assessment of the overall workload latency. We validate CIMinus against contemporary CIM architectures and demonstrate its applicability in two use-cases. These cases provide valuable insights into both the impact of sparsity patterns and the effectiveness of mapping strategies, bridging the gap between theoretical design and practical implementation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid workflow for multipatterning in EDA that leverages a GNN-based unsupervised model and refinement strategies to address lithographic constraints, achieving conflict-free decomposition and color balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in heuristic-based and SAT solver approaches for multipatterning, which struggle to handle complex constraints and secondary objectives simultaneously.

Method: The proposed method formulates multipatterning as a constrained graph coloring problem, using a GNN-based agent for unsupervised initial color predictions, followed by refinement strategies like a GNN-based heuristic and simulated annealing to improve results.

Result: The approach achieved complete conflict-free decomposition and consistent color balancing in experimental evaluations on proprietary and open-source data sets.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework offers a reproducible, data-efficient, and scalable solution to layout decomposition challenges in electronic design automation workflows.

Abstract: Multipatterning is an essential decomposition strategy in electronic design automation (EDA) that overcomes lithographic limitations when printing dense circuit layouts. Although heuristic-based backtracking and SAT solvers can address these challenges, they often struggle to simultaneously handle both complex constraints and secondary objectives. In this study, we present a hybrid workflow that casts multipatterning as a variant of a constrained graph coloring problem with the primary objective of minimizing feature violations and a secondary objective of balancing the number of features on each mask. Our pipeline integrates two main components: (1) A GNN-based agent, trained in an unsupervised manner to generate initial color predictions, which are refined by (2) refinement strategies (a GNN-based heuristic and simulated annealing) that together enhance solution quality and balance. Experimental evaluation in both proprietary data sets and publicly available open source layouts demonstrate complete conflict-free decomposition and consistent color balancing. The proposed framework provides a reproducible, data-efficient and deployable baseline for scalable layout decomposition in EDA workflows.

TL;DR: The study evaluates multilingual large language models (LLMs) on attribution patterns during Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, identifying limitations in interpretability, faithfulness, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the faithfulness and interpretability of CoT reasoning, especially focusing on multilingual settings to evaluate limitations and challenges.

Method: Two attribution methods, ContextCite (step-level) and Inseq (token-level), were applied to Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct using the MGSM benchmark, along with controlled perturbations to test robustness.

Result: Findings revealed issues like overemphasis on the final reasoning step during incorrect predictions, enhanced accuracy in high-resource languages using CoT prompting, and sensitivity to distractor sentences and negations.

Conclusion: CoT prompting has significant limitations in multilingual contexts, lacking robustness and transparency in interpretive reasoning chains.

Abstract: This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Theory of Mind focus on tasks like false-belief reasoning, neglecting diverse mental states and the richness of nonverbal communication.

Method: Developed Motion2Mind: a curated video dataset with annotations on 222 nonverbal cues and 397 mental states, beside psychological interpretations for assessing AI's NVC interpretation capabilities.

Result: AI systems performed poorly in detecting nonverbal cues and showed tendencies of over-interpretation when explaining them compared to humans.

Conclusion: Current AI systems lack reliable capabilities for interpreting nonverbal cues and understanding diverse mental states, emphasizing the need for advancements in ToM for machines.

Abstract: Our ability to interpret others' mental states through nonverbal cues (NVCs) is fundamental to our survival and social cohesion. While existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks have primarily focused on false-belief tasks and reasoning with asymmetric information, they overlook other mental states beyond belief and the rich tapestry of human nonverbal communication. We present Motion2Mind, a framework for evaluating the ToM capabilities of machines in interpreting NVCs. Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations. It encompasses 222 types of nonverbal cues and 397 mind states. Our evaluation reveals that current AI systems struggle significantly with NVC interpretation, exhibiting not only a substantial performance gap in Detection, as well as patterns of over-interpretation in Explanation compared to human annotators.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TOD-ProcBench, a benchmark to test LLMs' ability to follow complex task instructions in multi-turn dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for task-oriented dialogues oversimplify complex instructions into simple schemas, which fails to capture real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors developed TOD-ProcBench using the ABCD dataset, adding multi-level condition-action statements and defining three tasks to test LLMs on instruction retrieval, violation detection, and conditional response generation.

Result: The benchmark enables systematic evaluation of LLMs on instruction compliance under diverse conditions, including multilingual and varied text formats.

Conclusion: TOD-ProcBench provides a challenging framework to assess and improve LLM's ability to follow intricate and real-world task instructions in dialogues.

Abstract: In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.

*Kieron Kretschmar,Walter Laurito,Sharan Maiya,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduced LIARS' BENCH, a dataset for evaluating lie detection in language models, revealing limitations in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lie detection methods for large language models are validated narrowly and don't capture the diversity of lies these models can produce.

Method: LIARS' BENCH, a testbed with 72,863 examples across seven datasets, categorizing lies by model's reasons and belief objects; tests black-box and white-box lie detection techniques.

Result: Found that existing lie detection techniques fail systematically in certain scenarios, particularly when lies cannot be inferred from the transcript.

Conclusion: LIARS' BENCH highlights the shortcomings of existing detection methods and serves as a tool for improving lie detection progress.

Abstract: Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.

### [63] [Learning Tractable Distributions Of Language Model Continuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16054)
*Gwen Yidou-Weng,Ian Li,Anji Liu,Oliver Broadrick,Guy Van den Broeck,Benjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LTLA, a method that improves controlled language generation by combining neural context with efficient surrogate models (HMMs), avoiding computational pitfalls and enhancing constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of conditioning autoregressive language models on sequence-level constraints, which depend on future tokens and are generally intractable.

Method: LTLA uses a hybrid approach by pairing language models for prefix encoding with fixed surrogate models (HMMs) for continuation probabilities. Batch updates and efficient conditioning on neural contexts are employed to optimize performance.

Result: LTLA achieves higher conditional likelihoods, encodes visual context for vision-language models, and enhances constraint satisfaction in controlled-generation tasks with low inference cost.

Conclusion: LTLA proves effective in combining efficiency and context-aware surrogate models, improving outcomes in controlled language generation while minimizing computational overhead.

Abstract: Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ELPO, a new framework for optimizing prompts in large language models using ensemble learning to achieve better results compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of manual prompt engineering and existing automatic prompt optimization methods by creating a more robust and accurate optimization approach.

Method: Propose ELPO framework leveraging ensemble learning, incorporating voting mechanisms, shared generation strategies, and efficient algorithms for prompt optimization.

Result: ELPO demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, improving metrics like F1 score by 7.6 on tasks such as the ArSarcasm dataset.

Conclusion: ELPO provides significant advancements in automatic prompt optimization for LLMs, enhancing task performance through ensemble learning techniques.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), which selectively modifies parameters of specific model positions rather than all, improving efficiency and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study challenges the traditional approach of modifying all positional indices in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large models, questioning its necessity and efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce a new paradigm, TS-PEFT, which selectively applies fine-tuning modifications to a subset of indices rather than indiscriminately adjusting all positions.

Result: Experiments indicate that selective application of PEFT is more effective than uniformly applying it, potentially avoiding counterproductive modifications.

Conclusion: The research suggests a focused strategy for PEFT treatments, paving the way for more nuanced and resource-aware fine-tuning approaches in large language and vision models.

Abstract: In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical issues in research integrity, citation errors, and improve validation processes in academic literature.

Method: SemanticCite uses AI-based citation verification combining retrieval techniques and fine-tuned lightweight language models with a classification system.

Result: Fine-tuned lightweight models matched performance of larger systems with lower computational demands, verified by a dataset of 1,000 annotated citations.

Conclusion: SemanticCite provides an open-source scalable solution to enhance citation accuracy, streamline peer review, and support integrity in academic research.

Abstract: Effective scientific communication depends on accurate citations that validate sources and guide readers to supporting evidence. Yet academic literature faces mounting challenges: semantic citation errors that misrepresent sources, AI-generated hallucinated references, and traditional citation formats that point to entire papers without indicating which sections substantiate specific claims. We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.

### [68] [SeSE: A Structural Information-Guided Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16275)
*Xingtao Zhao,Hao Peng,Dingli Su,Xianghua Zeng,Chunyang Liu,Jinzhi Liao,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled framework to quantify uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) for hallucination detection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable uncertainty quantification in LLMs, critical for preventing hallucinated falsehoods in safety-critical applications.

Method: Developed SeSE, incorporating an adaptively sparsified semantic graph construction and structural entropy calculation to quantify intrinsic uncertainty based on latent semantic information.

Result: SeSE outperforms existing advanced UQ methods across 29 model-dataset combinations, offering significant improvements in hallucination detection.

Conclusion: Semantic Structural Entropy is a robust and theoretically grounded method for enhancing LLM uncertainty quantification, paving the way for safer deployment in sensitive use cases.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

*Wei Xia,Zhi-Hong Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SDA, a training-free, model-agnostic framework for aligning open-source language models with human intent at inference without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring large language models align with human intents during inference remains challenging, particularly due to the high resource demands of retraining or supervision.

Method: SDA dynamically adjusts model output probabilities based on user-defined instructions during inference, enhancing alignment without fine-tuning. It is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with diverse open-source LLMs.

Result: SDA improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs in terms of helpfulness (64.4%), honesty (30%), and harmlessness (11.5%).

Conclusion: SDA proves to be an effective, generalized, and flexible solution for aligning LLM behavior with human preferences, requiring no retraining and supporting personalized alignment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.

### [70] [Incorporating Self-Rewriting into Large Language Model Reasoning Reinforcement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16331)
*Jiashu Yao,Heyan Huang,Shuang Zeng,Chuwei Luo,WangJie You,Jie Tang,Qingsong Liu,Yuhang Guo,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-rewriting framework for large reasoning models to improve internal reasoning processes through selective rewriting of reasoning texts, achieving better accuracy and reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning approaches with outcome correctness rewards fail to supervise internal reasoning processes, leading to suboptimal reasoning quality such as over-thinking and disordered-thinking.

Method: The proposed method involves self-rewriting, where models revise their reasoning processes based on defined correctness criteria, with selective rewriting applied to 'simple' samples. This approach integrates rewriting and vanilla generation in a single batch for efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show improved accuracy (+0.6) and significantly shortened reasoning output by 46%. Internal reasoning quality also improved (+7.2) under LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

Conclusion: Self-rewriting successfully enhances internal reasoning quality and efficiency, outperforming strong baseline approaches in both accuracy and reasoning quality metrics.

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges LLMs face with idioms and figurative language by presenting datasets to help improve model understanding and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Idiomatic and figurative language are frequently used but remain challenging for LLMs to understand. The lack of specialized datasets hampers progress in improving LLMs' capabilities.

Method: The authors used a combined idiom list from recent datasets to create one large-scale dataset and two human-annotated datasets. These were processed for training LLMs and evaluated using tasks like idiom detection and sequence tagging.

Result: The introduced datasets were successfully used to assess and improve pre-trained LLMs' performance on idiom recognition, providing a novel resource for further research in handling figurative language.

Conclusion: The datasets contribute to advances in NLP by addressing an existing gap in idiom and figurative language understanding, enabling better training and evaluation of LLMs.

Abstract: Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

*Jonathan Kamp,Lisa Beinborn,Antske Fokkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the complexity and limitations of using rationales to assess and improve model performance, emphasizing the need for systematic metrics in understanding their impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of using sufficiency as a sole metric for analyzing the informativeness of rationales and their effects on model performance.

Method: The study evaluates models' ability to identify rationale tokens through token classification and incorporates rationale information in inputs using attention regularization, assessing their impacts across domains, tasks, and model types.

Result: Highly informative rationales do not necessarily improve instance classification. Sufficiency captures contextual effects outside the rationale, and incorporating rationale information inconsistently boosts cross-domain classification. Sufficiency and token classification are found unrelated.

Conclusion: Metrics like sufficiency provide limited insight into rationale effectiveness. More systematic approaches are needed to capture the complex relationship of rationales with model performance.

Abstract: Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.

TL;DR: The paper presents MinerU-HTML, a novel web data extraction method outperforming traditional models with improved content and structure preservation, showing its impact on language model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTML extraction in web data processing is often treated as a fixed step, leading to poor quality structured data. Improving extraction quality could significantly enhance downstream performance in language models.

Method: The authors introduce MinerU-HTML, a 0.6B-parameter language model-based approach that frames content extraction as a sequence labeling problem. It uses a two-stage formatting pipeline to improve semantic understanding and structural preservation.

Result: MinerU-HTML outperformed traditional methods (e.g., Trafilatura) in a benchmark test, achieving 81.8% ROUGE-N F1 versus 63.6% of Trafilatura and showed superior preservation of structural elements like code blocks and formulas.

Conclusion: MinerU-HTML demonstrated extraction quality significantly affects language model outcomes, promoting it as a critical and scalable solution for web corpus construction. Public releases include tools and datasets for further advancements.

Abstract: While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to determine if machine learning or deep learning can effectively differentiate between lower-quality and higher-quality news articles.

Method: Tested 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models on 1.4 million news articles from Common Crawl (2018-2024), labeled by expert consensus based on website quality. Used linguistics features and BERT-based models for classification.

Result: Deep learning models outperformed traditional machine learning methods. ModernBERT-large achieved the top performance with 0.8744 accuracy and 0.9593 ROC-AUC.

Conclusion: Deep learning models, in particular ModernBERT-large, can significantly outperform traditional machine learning methods in distinguishing between perceived low and high-quality news articles.

Abstract: This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how non-compositional language like idiomatic expressions is processed by transformer-based models.

Method: Utilize circuit discovery techniques such as a modified path patching algorithm to analyze computational patterns, identifying attention patterns and investigating phenomena like "Idiom Heads" and "augmented reception."

Result: Distinct computational patterns were found in idiom processing, including specialized attention heads and enhanced token interactions.

Conclusion: Insights were gained into how transformers handle idiomatic expressions, balancing efficiency and robustness, with implications for understanding complex grammatical constructs.

Abstract: We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.

### [78] [TurkColBERT: A Benchmark of Dense and Late-Interaction Models for Turkish Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16528)
*Özay Ezerceli,Mahmoud El Hussieni,Selva Taş,Reyhan Bayraktar,Fatma Betül Terzioğlu,Yusuf Çelebi,Yağız Asker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TurkColBERT, a benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish information retrieval, optimized for better performance and production-readiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural IR systems are less explored for morphologically rich, low-resource languages like Turkish. Dense bi-encoders dominate Turkish IR, but late-interaction models remain systematically unevaluated.

Method: The paper presents a two-stage adaptation process fine-tuning encoders via Turkish NLI/STS tasks and converting them into late-interaction ColBERT-style retrievers using MS MARCO-TR data.

Result: Late-interaction models outperform dense encoders, delivering strong parameter efficiency and faster query processing while maintaining competitive accuracy. Small models like colbert-hash-nano-tr and ColmmBERT-base-TR show significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: TurkColBERT demonstrates the potential of late-interaction models for Turkish IR, providing benchmarks and efficient retrieval systems suitable for production scenarios, though limitations like dataset size and translated benchmarks still exist.

Abstract: Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.

*Éloïse Benito-Rodriguez,Einar Urdshals,Jasmina Nasufi,Nicky Pochinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to predict text genres from LLM activations, achieving high F1-scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance understanding and deployment of LLMs by analyzing text genres through their activations.

Method: Using Mistral-7B model activations and scikit-learn classifiers on two datasets, genre prediction is performed.

Result: Genre predictions achieved F1-scores of up to 98% and 71%, outperforming control tasks.

Conclusion: This study proves that text genres can be identified through LLM activations using shallow learning models.

Abstract: Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.

*Zachary Ellis,Jared Joselowitz,Yash Deo,Yajie He,Anna Kalygina,Aisling Higham,Mana Rahimzadeh,Yan Jia,Ibrahim Habli,Ernest Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Word Error Rate (WER) fails to effectively assess the clinical impact of ASR errors, prompting the introduction of an LLM-based evaluation optimizing clinical safety assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of Automatic Speech Recognition primarily rely on Word Error Rate (WER), without adequately considering the clinical consequences of transcription errors in healthcare dialogues.

Method: Expert clinicians labeled transcription discrepancies' impact, and an LLM-based evaluation framework (optimized via GEPA) was developed to replicate clinical assessments with high accuracy.

Result: The LLM judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieved a 90% accuracy rate and Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816, closely mirroring expert evaluation of transcription errors within clinical dialogues.

Conclusion: This work outlines a scalable and clinically validated framework for ASR evaluation, emphasizing safety over textual accuracy in healthcare settings.

Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

### [81] [Integrating Symbolic Natural Language Understanding and Language Models for Word Sense Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16577)
*Kexin Zhao,Ken Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) by leveraging language models without requiring hand-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of WSD in natural language understanding, particularly for rich semantic representations, which aren't well-handled by current data-hungry methods focused on coarse-grained semantics.

Method: The authors convert symbolic NLU candidate meanings into language queries for statistical language models, enabling accurate sense disambiguation without manual annotation.

Result: Their method is validated as effective by testing against gold-standard human annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables automated and accurate disambiguation of rich representations, bypassing the need for labor-intensive manual data labeling.

Abstract: Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes two retrieval approaches for multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to address information loss when converting images into text for retrieval. It finds direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly improves performance and preserves visual context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal RAG systems lose critical visual details and context when images are summarized into text for storage, affecting retrieval accuracy and question answering in applications like financial documents.

Method: The paper compares text-based chunk retrieval and direct multimodal embedding retrieval. Experiments are conducted using 6 LLM models, 2 multimodal embedding models, and a financial earnings call benchmark with 40 question-answer pairs.

Result: Direct multimodal embedding retrieval outperforms text-based summarization approaches, with 13% absolute and 32% relative improvement in mean average precision (mAP@5), and 11% absolute and 20% relative improvement in nDCG@5. It also provides more accurate and factually consistent answers.

Conclusion: Direct multimodal embeddings are superior for preserving visual context and ensuring effective retrieval and inference, addressing limitations of existing text-based RAG systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents "Nemotron Elastic," a framework for creating nested large language models (LLMs) that can produce multiple submodels optimized for varied deployment configurations without additional fine-tuning. It significantly reduces training costs and maintains competitive or superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art compression techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models in multiple sizes for different objectives is costly and time-intensive. Traditional approaches like pruning and knowledge distillation still require extensive resources, demanding an efficient alternative.

Method: The Nemotron Elastic framework creates nested LLMs using a unified training process. The parent model embeds multiple submodels optimized for different configurations, employing an end-to-end trained router, a two-stage training curriculum, and novel elastification techniques like group-aware SSM and heterogeneous MLP adjustments. Knowledge distillation is used for simultaneous optimizations.

Result: Applied to Nemotron Nano V2 12B, Nemotron Elastic produced submodels of 9B and 6B sizes using only 110B tokens—yielding a 360x cost reduction compared to training from scratch and about 7x compared to state-of-the-art compression. The nested submodels achieve comparable or superior performance to existing methods while maintaining constant deployment memory regardless of submodel count.

Conclusion: Nemotron Elastic provides an efficient framework for developing multi-configurable reasoning models, significantly lowering costs and enabling a flexible, all-in-one solution for LLM deployment. It outperforms current compression methods in accuracy and resource efficiency, addressing scalability challenges of training LLM families.

Abstract: Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniFit, a universal virtual try-on framework guided by multimodal large language models (MLLM), addressing challenges in semantic alignment and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON frameworks struggle with diverse tasks due to semantic gaps between text and image references, as well as insufficient data for complex scenarios.

Method: UniFit employs an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA) for cross-modal coherence and uses a two-stage training strategy to enhance learning capabilities with limited data.

Result: UniFit supports a variety of tasks such as multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, and delivers state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: UniFit demonstrates that MLLMs can effectively enhance semantic alignment and task range in VTON applications, providing a robust and versatile solution.

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: EfficientSAM3 proposes a lightweight version of SAM3 for visual segmentation tasks, enabling on-device usage without sacrificing significant performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3), originally too resource-intensive, accessible for on-device use while retaining its promptable concept segmentation capabilities for images and videos.

Method: Introduces Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) in three stages: encoder distillation with prompt-in-the-loop training, temporal memory distillation using a compact module, and end-to-end fine-tuning on SAM3 data. Employs lightweight student models utilizing efficient vision backbones.

Result: EfficientSAM3 achieves notable performance in visual object segmentation and tracking on popular datasets, demonstrating a strong balance between computational efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3 showcases that lightweight models can retain high fidelity to more complex architectures while becoming suitable for edge and on-device applications.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in 6D object pose estimation for unseen objects under occlusion, presenting a robust method that improves accuracy and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from difficulties in accurately estimating 6D object poses, especially for unseen objects and under occlusion, which degrades performance in robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding.

Method: The paper introduces a novel approach with dynamic dense sampling, multi-hypothesis inference, iterative refinement, and occlusion-focused training augmentations. It also proposes a visibility-weighted evaluation metric.

Result: Their approach yielded over 5% accuracy improvement on ICBIN and over 2% improvement on BOP benchmarks, while reducing inference time by approximately 3 times.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances robustness and generalization for unseen objects under occlusion, addressing key limitations of previous approaches and advancing 6D object pose estimation.

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a way to generate synthetic historical maps for training deep learning models, particularly for land-cover interpretation, by transferring cartographic styles and introducing uncertainty through automated and manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated training data for specific historical map corpora limits the application of deep learning for tasks like land-cover interpretation; creating such data manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Method: The authors developed two techniques: (1) an automatic deep generative approach and (2) a manual stochastic degradation technique, to generate synthetic maps with realistic uncertainty and noise, and applied these to domain-adaptive semantic segmentation.

Result: The generated synthetic dataset was employed in a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques for semantic segmentation on a homogeneous historical map corpus.

Conclusion: The study provides an efficient solution to data scarcity in historical map analysis by leveraging style transfer and uncertainty modeling, showcasing its impact in improving domain-adaption tasks on homogeneous map corpora.

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Box6D, a method for efficient and accurate 6D pose estimation of storage boxes using RGB-D observations, significantly improving inference speed and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation methods face challenges under clutter and occlusion, particularly in warehouse environments, including limited flexibility of model-based methods, low robustness of model-free methods, and impracticality of category-level methods.

Method: Box6D uses a category CAD template to infer the dimensions of storage boxes via binary search and depth-based plausibility filtering. It employs early-stopping strategies to reduce computational costs.

Result: Box6D achieves competitive or superior 6D pose estimation precision, with inference times reduced by approximately 76%, demonstrated through tests on real-world warehouse scenarios and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Box6D enhances pose estimation for storage boxes, offering accurate and efficient results tailored to warehouse contexts, addressing limitations of existing methods while improving practical applicability.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance Vision Language Models (VLMs) for domain-specific video classification by introducing textual rationales generated by the model itself followed by fine-tuning on these rationales and task-specific labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Language Models often struggle with domain-specific video classification due to a lack of sufficient domain-specific data and a gap between complex video content and abstract labels.

Method: The approach consists of two stages: (1) prompting the VLM to generate textual rationales for videos for domain-specific context and fine-tuning based on these rationales, and (2) applying traditional supervised fine-tuning using task labels.

Result: Experiments across various datasets show that this method outperforms direct supervised fine-tuning, efficiently adapting VLMs to domain-specific tasks with fewer annotations.

Conclusion: Generating self-supervised textual rationales bridges semantic gaps, making VLMs more effective for domain-specific video analysis without requiring extensive additional data annotations.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

*Zihan Li,Yiqing Wang,Sina Farsiu,Paul Kinahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL) to address limitations in single-granularity image-text alignment, improving performance in complex domains like medical imaging by employing cross-granularity and multi-label strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-label, single-granularity alignment in image-text models, such as CLIP, struggles in domains like medical imaging that require multi-label and structured high-granularity information understanding.

Method: MGLL utilizes structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions at different granularities, employs soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints, and uses smooth KL divergence to maintain cross-granularity alignment within a computationally efficient framework.

Result: MGLL shows superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods when pre-trained and tested on large-scale multi-granular datasets, showcasing enhanced alignment and task performance.

Conclusion: MGLL effectively overcomes the limitations of single-label frameworks, offering robust multi-granular alignment suitable for complex domains like medical imaging and improving upon existing multimodal learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

*Milos Vukadinovic,Hirotaka Ieki,Yuki Sahasi,David Ouyang,Bryan He*

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated method using deep learning to extract standard 2D echocardiography views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, validated for accuracy and clinical usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in cardiac imaging by integrating the speed and usability of 3D scanning with the familiarity and precision of traditional 2D echocardiography views.

Method: The authors employed a deep learning view classifier complemented by heuristics based on anatomical landmarks and cardiologist insights to reconstruct standard 2D echocardiographic views from 3D ultrasound volumes.

Result: Their method achieved 96% accuracy in blinded evaluations with cardiologists on 1,600 videos from two hospitals; additionally, downstream evaluations confirmed diagnostic and spatial integrity for detecting cardiac abnormalities and generating clinical-grade measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully enables accurate interpretation of 3D ultrasound data in a familiar 2D format for clinicians, making 3D echocardiography more accessible and practical in clinical settings. The code and a sample dataset are publicly available for use and further research.

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

*Raphael Ruschel,Hardikkumar Prajapati,Awsafur Rahman,B. S. Manjunath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph introduces an interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG), enabling user guidance to improve video scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current VSGG systems that lack human interaction capabilities and promptable segmentation models that cannot perform semantic or relational reasoning.

Method: Click2Graph combines promptable visual segmentation with modules for temporal, spatial, and semantic reasoning. It includes a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module and a Semantic Classification Head.

Result: Click2Graph demonstrates enhanced user-guided PVSG performance on the OpenPVSG benchmark, providing a strong foundation for combining human prompting with scene graph generation.

Conclusion: The framework enables controllable, interpretable video scene understanding through human interaction, bridging gaps between segmentation models and VSGG systems.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

*Muyao Yuan,Yuanhong Zhang,Weizhan Zhang,Lan Ma,Yuan Gao,Jiangyong Ying,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoCLIP uses an information-theoretic approach to improve CLIP's fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by enhancing modality alignment and mutual information transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches fine-tuning CLIP for segmentation often degrade its vision-language alignment and face overfitting challenges. This paper aims to stabilize alignment during fine-tuning.

Method: InfoCLIP proposes two objectives: compressing pixel-text modality alignment to eliminate noise and maximizing mutual information between pretrained and fine-tuned models for effective alignment transfer.

Result: InfoCLIP showed superior performance in improving CLIP fine-tuning across diverse benchmarks, ensuring effective semantic segmentation with better alignment preservation.

Conclusion: The study proves InfoCLIP's ability to address alignment degradation and fine-tuning problems, enabling robust open-vocabulary semantic segmentation via asymmetric knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of destructive task interference in multi-task learning, which limits generalization and model performance in breast ultrasound tumor segmentation tasks.

Method: The authors introduced a consistency regularization method featuring differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features to align segmentation and classification tasks effectively. Evaluation was performed on the BrEaST dataset and tested on three external datasets.

Result: The proposed approach significantly improved generalization in segmentation tasks (Dice coefficient improvements: 0.81 vs. 0.59, 0.66 vs. 0.56, and 0.69 vs. 0.49) and achieved state-of-the-art external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Conclusion: The novel consistency regularization approach mitigates destructive interference in multi-task learning, enhancing segmentation generalization and setting a new benchmark in performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a detection-guided generative framework for visual semantic understanding focusing on hierarchy-based category and attribute recognition to overcome limitations of global similarity methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with fine-grained distinctions and attribute diversity in large-scale e-commerce scenarios due to reliance on global similarity.

Method: The paper introduces a BART-based generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens using refined ROI-level features with property-conditioned attribute recognition.

Result: Experiments on proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets showcase the proposed framework's significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: This framework provides a more robust and unified approach to fine-grained recognition and inference in visual semantic tasks, especially in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

*Dawei Li,Zijian Gu,Peng Wang,Chuhan Song,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Tianlong Chen,Yu Tian,Song Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses fairness issues in medical image reasoning for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by proposing a novel approach called Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS). FADS reduces demographic disparities without requiring fine-tuning, using clustering-based sampling for balanced in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fairness concerns in medical image reasoning using MLLMs, where biases across demographic groups such as gender, race, and ethnicity pose issues. Current debiasing methods are impractical for large-scale models as they require extensive labeled datasets or fine-tuning.

Method: The paper proposes Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), a clustering-based sampling method to create demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations for in-context learning. This enables fairness improvements without fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments conducted on multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrated that FADS reduces disparities related to gender, race, and ethnicity while maintaining high accuracy for medical image reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that fairness-aware in-context learning, as demonstrated by FADS, is a scalable and efficient solution to achieving fairness in medical image reasoning without the need for large labeled datasets or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

*Nimeshika Udayangani,Hadi M. Dolatabadi,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based approach using Gaussianization and graph convolutional networks to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in long-tailed datasets, achieving better false positive rates and classification accuracy on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in OOD detection and low tail-class accuracy in long-tailed datasets with deep neural networks, ensuring safer deployment.

Method: The approach uses graph-based representation initialized from pre-trained model features, Gaussianization for activation layer adjustments, and graph convolutional networks to refine the feature space for OOD detection.

Result: The method shows superior performance on benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT, outperforming existing methods in false positive rates and tail-class classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Graph-based approaches offer a promising solution to OOD detection issues, especially in long-tailed datasets, enhancing both reliability and accuracy.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to create wearable adversarial textures for garments to consistently evade human detection across video sequences in various real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing wearable adversarial attacks that fail to ensure concealment throughout video sequences involving motion and garment deformation.

Method: Developed a sequence-level optimization framework combining UV-based garment mapping, ICC color constraints, and physically based human-garment simulation, alongside an expectation-over-transformation optimization objective.

Result: Showed strong concealment across video sequences, robust performance against multi-angle viewpoints, effective cross-model transferability, and real-world success using physical sublimation-printed garments.

Conclusion: Proposed a robust and feasible approach for wearable adversarial manipulation that ensures consistent performance across real-world scenarios, enhancing privacy and safety in surveillance environments.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) by integrating sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and refining expert activation for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers sought to improve real-world image super-resolution models' ability to adapt to diverse, complex degraded inputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Existing dense models are limited in adaptive knowledge sharing and handling heterogeneous degradation features.

Method: The paper proposes a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) approach that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert via fine-grained expert partitioning. It introduces degradation estimation using CLIP embeddings and degradation-aware load-balancing loss to optimize active expert allocation dynamically.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrated the MoR architecture's state-of-the-art performance, enhanced ability to handle degraded images, and efficient computational resource usage.

Conclusion: The proposed MoR enhances Real-ISR by enabling adaptive and flexible expert activation, offering superior image resolution quality on complex degradation cases within an efficient computational framework.

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Result: The CNN achieved 98.30% accuracy on the training set, 96.88% on the validation set, and an F1-score of 0.9643 on a test set of 3000 images across 30 materials.

Conclusion: The proposed technique offers a reliable and efficient solution for material classification and control in laser cutting processes, addressing environmental and operational challenges.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient sparse-view 3D reconstruction as 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with supervision scarcity and overfitting due to limited viewpoints.

Method: CuriGS employs pseudo-views called student views around ground-truth poses with varying perturbation levels. A curriculum schedule gradually introduces complexity with student views evaluated by multi-signal metric, ensuring high-quality augmentation.

Result: CuriGS significantly outperforms current baselines in rendering fidelity and geometric consistency, demonstrating robust performance in synthetic and real sparse-view scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework provides a stable and effective solution for sparse-view 3D reconstruction, leveraging curriculum-based pseudo-view augmentation to overcome challenges in supervision scarcity and overfitting.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of satellite imagery in micro-plot management for modern farming systems by leveraging UAV data.

Method: A cross-modal learning strategy is developed to enrich high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV-level visual details using co-registered satellite and UAV image pairs of maize varieties.

Result: The study demonstrates that UAV-like satellite representations outperform original satellite imagery in tasks like nitrogen and yield prediction.

Conclusion: Cross-modal correspondence learning offers a promising solution to bridge the resolution gap between satellite and UAV sensing for agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework utilizing large language models (LLMs) to improve food recognition by addressing domain shift, long-tail distribution, and subtle visual variations in food datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in food recognition due to domain shifts, long-tail data distributions, and fine-grained visual variations between real-world and internet-sourced food images.

Method: The method combines LLMs to parse food images into food titles and ingredients, followed by mapping the generated texts and food images into a shared embedding space to align features for more effective recognition.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing techniques for addressing long-tail data, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification on two benchmark food datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of LLMs for parsing and feature alignment enhances food recognition performance, proving more effective than specialized approaches for the considered challenges.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for visual autoregressive models (VARs) to address memory inefficiencies and enable scalable image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the bottleneck of excessive KV memory growth in VAR models during next-scale prediction and improve scalability.

Method: AMS-KV prioritizes storing Key-Values (KV) from condensed and local scales while optimizing cache utilization through inter-scale similarity analysis to improve computational efficiency.

Result: AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83%, decreases self-attention latency by 60.48%, and allows stable scaling to a batch size of 256 from 128.

Conclusion: AMS-KV significantly enhances VAR model scalability and efficiency, supporting larger batch sizes and maintaining image generation quality.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Result: LiSTAR significantly outperforms existing approaches by reducing generation MMD by 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%, demonstrating its efficacy in generating realistic LiDAR data.

Conclusion: LiSTAR offers a robust framework for high-fidelity, controllable 4D LiDAR synthesis, establishing a strong foundation for advanced autonomous driving simulation environments.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Conclusion: SpectralTrain provides a practical, efficient solution to HSI classification computational challenges, demonstrating the value of optimizing training strategies beyond architectural design.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

TL;DR: LEGO-SLAM integrates open-vocabulary semantic understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM systems, enabling real-time, adaptable, photorealistic mapping with reduced memory and rendering overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM systems lack open-vocabulary semantic understanding for advanced robotic tasks, hindered by excessive memory demands and static, inflexible approaches.

Method: LEGO-SLAM employs a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder to compress language embeddings into compact feature spaces, enabling real-time mapping, semantic redundancy reduction, and language-based loop detection.

Result: LEGO-SLAM reduces Gaussian count by over 60% without compromising rendering quality, achieves competitive mapping and tracking at 15 FPS, and supports open-vocabulary capabilities.

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM advances SLAM by integrating real-time semantic understanding and adaptability, addressing memory and rendering challenges, and improving robotic interaction applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

Motivation: The paper aims to achieve robust and scalable outdoor SLAM systems by leveraging 4D mmWave radar, overcoming challenges such as noise reduction, texture consistency, and rendering artifacts in large-scale mapping.

Method: Rad-GS integrates radar point clouds, Doppler information, and images into a 3D Gaussian spatial representation, employing dynamic object masking, global refinement, and memory-efficient octree structures.

Result: Rad-GS achieves performance on par with traditional camera/LiDAR-based methods, demonstrating robust outdoor mapping using radar in experiments and real-world kilometer-scale environments.

Conclusion: Rad-GS shows strong potential for large-scale outdoor scene reconstruction, offering a practical alternative to traditional SLAM systems utilizing radar data.

Abstract: We present Rad-GS, a 4D radar-camera SLAM system designed for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, utilizing 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2T-VICL for unified vision-language models to perform visual in-context learning (VICL) across different visual tasks, achieving strong results across multiple scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether vision-language models (VLMs) can perform visual in-context learning (VICL) when visual prompts and target images belong to different tasks.

Method: A mechanism to generate and select text prompts describing differences between tasks, creation of a cross-task VICL dataset, and an inference framework combining perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics.

Result: The proposed approach achieved top-tier performance in nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier results in ten additional scenarios.

Conclusion: T2T-VICL unlocks the potential of cross-task VICL within vision-language models, demonstrating its efficacy across diverse tasks.

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with dynamic scene reconstruction due to ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification.

Method: The proposed method includes Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition, and Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting to address rendering errors and improve mapping consistency.

Result: The method improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality, providing a 0.39dB PSNR improvement on the Technicolor Light Field dataset.

Conclusion: This work significantly enhances dynamic scene reconstruction, providing better alignment and error correction for splats, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on benchmark datasets with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCS-LDM decouples content complexity from scale in latent diffusion models to support flexible visual generation at arbitrary resolutions or frame rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion models tie scale to content complexity, but this is unnecessary as content complexity depends on data intricacy, not resolution or frame rates.

Method: The method constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space to model visual complexity using multi-level tokens, allowing decoding at varying resolutions and frame rates within a fixed representation.

Result: DCS-LDM achieves state-of-the-art performance with flexible generation capabilities across scales and qualities.

Conclusion: DCS-LDM enables efficient, high-quality, and adaptable visual content generation by decoupling scale from complexity and supports progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigms.

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

### [113] [VTinker: Guided Flow Upsampling and Texture Mapping for High-Resolution Video Frame Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16124)
*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents VTinker, a novel video frame interpolation (VFI) approach that addresses challenges in motion estimation and interpolation by improving flow upsampling and utilizing texture mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VFI methods struggle with large pixel movement, high computational costs, and inaccurate flow estimation due to reliance on low-resolution flow predictions and high-magnification upsampling, leading to visual artifacts.

Method: VTinker introduces guided flow upsampling (GFU) to improve flow clarity and Texture Mapping to reduce ghosting and discontinuities by integrating clear texture blocks into the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module.

Result: VTinker demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in video frame interpolation, outperforming existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed VTinker framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional VFI methods, improving motion estimation accuracy and visual quality of interpolated frames. The method offers a robust solution for high-resolution VFI tasks.

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PiN-CLIP, a method that uses positive-incentive noise to improve AI-generated image detection by suppressing shortcut sensitivities and enhancing robust feature extraction, achieving superior performance compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of detecting AI-generated images, particularly issues with out-of-distribution generalization caused by spurious shortcuts in training.

Method: PiN-CLIP jointly trains a noise generator and detection network by injecting positive-incentive noise into the feature space during training, suppressing shortcuts and enhancing stable forensic cues through cross-attention fusion of visual and semantic features.

Result: The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, showing a significant improvement of 5.4 in average accuracy on a dataset with images from 42 generative models.

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP effectively addresses limitations in generalizing across datasets and strengthens the capability of detecting AI-generated images by focusing on generalized artifact representations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

*Li Yu,Yingbo Zhao,Shiyu Wu,Siyue Yu,Moncef Gabbouj,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blind methods for video quality enhancement are improved with a novel degradation representation learning module and hierarchical termination mechanism, achieving better performance and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing video quality enhancement methods that require known quantization parameters or lack detailed spatial degradation representation.

Method: Propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning module for high-dimensional, multiscale degradation extraction and a hierarchical termination mechanism to adjust computational stages based on compression levels.

Result: The approach achieved a significant PSNR improvement of 110% over state-of-the-art blind methods at QP = 22 and halved inference time compared to QP = 42.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances video quality by adapting to varying artifact patterns and compression levels, offering improved efficiency and performance in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve real-time 3D object detection by overcoming the training-inference gap caused by spatial unreliability and lack of ranking awareness during training.

Method: The framework employs spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment and rank-aware adaptive self-distillation to align training with inference evaluation.

Result: Experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over prior methods, with real-time speed.

Conclusion: SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap, enhancing spatial reliability and ranking awareness for better indoor point cloud object detection.

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

*Quanqing Ma,Jiaen Chen,Peng Wang,Yao Zheng,Qingzhan Zhao,Yuchen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel high spatial resolution dataset (HSRW-CD) and a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) module to improve water body change detection (WBCD) using remote sensing imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WBCD applications in urban and rural regions are limited due to the lack of high spatial resolution data and the inability of previous deep learning methods to fully utilize spatial semantic and structural information.

Method: Creation of HSRW-CD dataset and design of SSCP module comprising MSA, SRGA, and CSA components, which improve semantic and structural extraction in WBCD models.

Result: Experiments on HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets demonstrate the enhanced discrimination capability and generalization of the SSCP module in WBCD tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and SSCP module address key limitations in WBCD, offering scalable improvements for high-resolution remote sensing applications while being adaptable to existing models.

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) lack the ability to assess deception in social interactions. A new task and dataset highlight this gap, and a novel framework improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inability of MLLMs to assess deception or accurately interpret complex multimodal social interactions, a crucial aspect of human intelligence.

Method: A new task, MIDA, and its related dataset were introduced for benchmarking MLLMs’ ability to assess deception. Additionally, the authors proposed a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module.

Result: The study reveals significant performance shortcomings in state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, in distinguishing between truth and falsehood. However, the proposed SoCoT pipeline and DSEM module improved performance on the new task.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates existing gaps in MLLMs' social reasoning and presents a viable framework for addressing these shortcomings, paving the way for more perceptive AI systems.

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that explicitly integrating reasoning into embedding extraction enhances multimodal representation quality and retrieval performance, highlighting the untapped potential of MLLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

*Jian Ma,Qirong Peng,Xujie Zhu,Peixing Xie,Chen Chen,Haonan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PPCL, a pruning method for DiT architectures, achieving a 50% parameter reduction with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational costs of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: PPCL is a pruning framework combining linear probing and differential trend analysis for identifying redundant layers, and integrates a teacher-student alternating distillation scheme for depth and width pruning in one training phase.

Result: PPCL reduces DiT models' parameters by 50% while maintaining image generation quality with less than 3% objective metric degradation.

Conclusion: PPCL is effective for optimizing Diffusion Transformers in constrained environments, balancing high compression rates and generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

*Yibin Huang,Wang Xu,Wanyue Zhang,Helu Zhi,Jingjing Huang,Yangbin Xu,Yangang Sun,Conghui Zhu,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video2Layout introduces a framework for reconstructing continuous metric spatial layouts from videos, surpassing grid-based representations in spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models lack a fine-grained spatial reasoning mechanism due to reliance on raster-based representations for understanding visual inputs.

Method: Video2Layout employs boundary coordinates to compute object distances and sizes. A supervised fine-tuning stage with a simulator-based dataset, followed by reinforcement stage, enhances real-world generalization.

Result: On QVS-Bench and spatial reasoning benchmarks, Video2Layout achieved a 4.92% accuracy improvement over grid map trained models, demonstrating enhanced spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Video2Layout addresses limitations in discrete visual spatial models, offering a refined method based on metric-grounded spatial layouts for better accuracy and generalization in spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

*Lirui Zhang,Zhengkai Zhao,Zhi Zuo,Pan Gao,Jie Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Simba, a framework using diffusion models and symmetry priors for point cloud completion, addressing limitations of prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods in point cloud completion fail to balance preservation of fine details with structural integrity, and are prone to overfitting and sensitivity to noise.

Method: Simba leverages diffusion models for distribution learning of transformations and employs a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture for upsampling.

Result: Simba achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI.

Conclusion: This paper presents an effective and robust approach to point cloud completion, enhancing geometric structure preservation and generalization.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LNG-SWR is a novel method to enhance segmentation model stability in medical imaging under distribution shifts and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address stability issues in segmentation models under distribution shifts and perturbations, particularly in medical imaging.

Method: LNG-SWR introduces noise during training to steer representations away from noise-sensitive directions and leverages wavelet-based frequency adaptation to suppress noise while enhancing relevant features.

Result: On CT and ultrasound datasets, LNG-SWR improves clean accuracy, robustness under adversarial attacks, and works effectively with adversarial training.

Conclusion: LNG-SWR is a scalable, effective, and engineering-friendly approach for robust medical image segmentation with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

*Zhi Luo,Zenghui Yuan,Wenqi Wei,Daizong Liu,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to manipulate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) into generating verbose text outputs using adversarial image perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address efficiency issues in the deployment of VLMs, specifically by examining and controlling the tendency of these models to produce lengthy, low-information outputs that increase energy, latency, and costs.

Method: The paper proposes a verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) using a two-stage framework: adversarial prompt search with reinforcement learning and vision-aligned perturbation to optimize input images and make them induce verbose text generation.

Result: Experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that VTIA reliably triggers verbose outputs with high effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The technique successfully exploits VLMs vulnerabilities to generate lengthy outputs, offering insights into adversarial attacks and their implications for model efficiency.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoVLA, a self-supervised Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework addressing stage hallucination in robotic long-horizon manipulation, achieving improved task success and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in long-horizon robotic manipulation caused by stage hallucination, which prevents truthful evaluation of task completion by exploiting evaluation shortcuts.

Method: EvoVLA employs three components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR) for visual grounding, Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE) for curiosity based on object pose, and Long-Horizon Memory for stable context retention and fusion during extended tasks.

Result: EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points, decreases stage hallucination by 23.7 percentage points, enhances sim-to-real performance by 11 percent, and achieves better efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: EvoVLA effectively addresses the limitations of current VLA models, improving both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation capabilities with significant gains in task success rates and reliability.

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

*Boshen Xu,Zihan Xiao,Jiaze Li,Jianzhong Ju,Zhenbo Luo,Jian Luan,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeViper is a hybrid vision-language model designed for understanding long videos by combining efficient state-space models with attention mechanisms, enabling the processing of hour-long videos with over 10,000 frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video understanding is challenging due to the need for efficient architecture and mechanisms to handle extended temporal contexts.

Method: A hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone is introduced, combined with a TransV token transfer module to compress and transfer vision token information, allowing efficient long video analysis.

Result: TimeViper achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art models while extending the ability to process an extensive number of video frames.

Conclusion: The research provides a foundation for developing hybrid Mamba-Transformer models, advancing their interpretability and applying novel token compression methods to long video understanding.

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) by addressing distraction in CLIP's vision-language alignment using a new approach called RF-CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pixel-level multimodal alignment for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, considering CLIP's internal mechanisms to overcome distractions affecting dense prediction performance.

Method: Developed RF-CLIP, a training-free method that redirects CLIP's attention from irrelevant tokens back to target regions by filtering dimension-specific over-activations.

Result: RF-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmarks while remaining inference efficient.

Conclusion: Redirecting CLIP's attention can significantly enhance multimodal dense predictions for OVSS without imposing additional training requirements.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

TL;DR: SurvAgent is introduced as an AI system to improve cancer survival prediction through multimodal data integration, explainability, and leveraging historical cases, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current survival prediction methods for cancer prognosis are not transparent enough, hindering clinical adoption.

Method: SurvAgent applies a hierarchical chain-of-thought system to integrate pathology images and gene data, enhance region exploration, and utilize historical analytical processes.

Result: SurvAgent showed superior performance compared to traditional methods and advanced AI tools across five TCGA cohorts.

Conclusion: SurvAgent sets a new benchmark for explainable AI in precision oncology and survival prediction.

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mantis is a novel framework tackling issues in Vision-Language-Action models, achieving superior performance via disentangled visual foresight and better language supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of high-dimensional visual state prediction and the neglect of language supervision limiting comprehension and reasoning capabilities in VLA models.

Method: Mantis employs disconnection of visual foresight using meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head, enabling efficient next-state prediction and improving comprehension through language supervision.

Result: Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark, surpassing baselines, showing efficient generalization, reasoning, and convergence speed.

Conclusion: The framework improves vision-language integration in action models, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalization, making it a new benchmark for the VLA field.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) performance in real-world scenarios through unsupervised domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most VI-ReID algorithms fail in real-world applications due to differences between public datasets and new data, requiring adaptation without annotated samples for practical use.

Method: A two-stage model called DSLGA is proposed: Domain-Shared Learning (DSLS) for pre-training to handle inter-domain discrepancies and Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) for fine-tuning to address intra-domain discrepancies through cluster-to-holistic alignment.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed DSLGA method significantly outperforms other domain adaptation and supervised methods under various settings.

Conclusion: The DSLGA model and CMDA-XD testing method effectively address domain adaptation issues for VI-ReID, improving real-world application performance and transferability.

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

TL;DR: The paper presents TwiG, a novel interleaved framework combining visual generation with textual reasoning in real time, improving context-aware outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of real-time multimodal interaction during visual generation seen in previous approaches relying on pre-planning or post-refinement textual reasoning.

Method: Introduced Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), which interleaves textual reasoning with visual content generation. Studied strategies include zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning using a custom dataset (TwiG-50K), and reinforcement learning through the TwiG-GRPO approach.

Result: TwiG enables co-evolving reasoning and generation processes, producing more contextually and semantically rich visuals.

Conclusion: This innovative interplay between generation and reasoning sets a foundation for further exploration into dynamic multimodal frameworks, enhancing visual content creation.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep-learning models often fail to maintain anatomical plausibility when reconstructing interconnected organs or structures.

Method: PrIntMesh uses a connected template to deform substructures jointly, ensuring topology preservation and smooth organ reconstruction.

Result: The method achieves accurate geometry, correct topology, and robust performance on organs like the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, even with noisy or limited data.

Conclusion: PrIntMesh demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared to voxel- and surface-based approaches, making it potentially suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

TL;DR: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are analyzed for their adversarial robustness, particularly in multimodal and black-box contexts, using a new framework named VLA-Fool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on the robustness of Vision-Language-Action models, particularly against adversarial attacks that involve multimodal and cross-modal disruptions.

Method: The study introduced VLA-Fool, which performs adversarial attacks at three levels: textual perturbations, visual perturbations, and cross-modal misalignment. A semantic-guided prompting framework is also developed to evaluate and improve VLA models.

Result: Experimental results on the LIBERO benchmark using an improved OpenVLA model show that minor multimodal adversarial perturbations can significantly disrupt model behavior.

Conclusion: Vision-Language-Action models are vulnerable to multimodal adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for improved robustness in these systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICCE, a novel unsupervised image classification method using multi-head clustering and cluster ensembling to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve unsupervised image classification by addressing the challenges in clustering accuracy and representation learning using ensemble strategies.

Method: The ICCE method involves multi-head clustering on a pre-trained backbone, application of cluster ensembling for consensus, and training a classifier with pseudo-labels derived from the ensemble results.

Result: ICCE achieved state-of-the-art results, with 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet, surpassing existing unsupervised methods.

Conclusion: ICCE narrows the gap between unsupervised and supervised image classification methods, setting a new standard by exceeding 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

### [135] [SwiTrack: Tri-State Switch for Cross-Modal Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16227)
*Boyue Xu,Ruichao Hou,Tongwei Ren,Dongming Zhou,Gangshan Wu,Jinde Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwiTrack, a novel framework for cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) with three streams and dynamic template updates, achieving state-of-the-art performance in RGB-NIR tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CMOT methods struggle to effectively extract modality-specific features and address object drift, particularly under unreliable inputs.

Method: SwiTrack employs three streams: RGB processing by a visual encoder, NIR refinement through a gated adapter and visual encoder, and invalid modality handling via a consistency trajectory prediction module. It also introduces dynamic template reconstruction and feature consistency loss.

Result: SwiTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving precision rate by 7.2% and success rate by 4.3%, and operates at 65 frames per second.

Conclusion: The proposed approach redefines CMOT with robust tracking mechanisms and demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for smooth full-body tracking in AR/VR using sparse inputs with a neural network model enhanced with a Memory-Block and multi-task learning. Their method outperforms existing techniques and achieves high frame rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-body tracking in AR/VR remains inaccurate and incomplete due to reliance on sparse inputs from head-mounted devices and controllers.

Method: They propose a novel MLP-based neural network enhanced by residual connections and a Memory-Block to process sparse signals while using multi-task learning for improved temporal consistency and robustness.

Result: Their approach significantly reduces prediction errors compared to current baselines and achieves 72 frames per second on mobile devices.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively balances accuracy with running time, making it suitable for AR/VR applications requiring full-body tracking.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

TL;DR: TetraSDF introduces a method to extract precise meshes from neural signed distance functions using a ReLU MLP composed with a tetrahedral positional encoder, addressing issues of discretization error and enabling self-consistent mesh generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mesh extraction for zero-level set neural signed distance functions faces challenges due to discretization errors in sampling and limited applicability of existing methods. TetraSDF aims to overcome these issues.

Method: Developed TetraSDF, utilizing a ReLU MLP with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder, leveraging barycentric interpolation and a fixed analytic input preconditioner for stability and accuracy.

Result: TetraSDF achieved superior reconstruction accuracy across benchmarks compared to grid-based encoders and produced meshes faithful to learned isosurfaces with efficient runtime and memory usage.

Conclusion: TetraSDF provides a practical framework for precise analytic meshing of SDFs, improving accuracy and consistency while maintaining performance efficiency.

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Texture3dgs, an optimized implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting for mobile GPUs, achieving significant efficiency improvements for image-based 3D scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting and achieve robust 3D scene reconstruction on mobile devices to enhance data privacy, offline functionality, and faster processing.

Method: The approach involves optimizing a novel sorting algorithm tailored for mobile GPUs' 2D texture cache, alongside additional algorithmic enhancements like improved variable layout design.

Result: Texture3dgs achieves up to 4.1× speedup in sorting and 1.7× overall speedup in 3D scene reconstruction, while reducing memory usage by 1.6× on mobile platforms.

Conclusion: Texture3dgs significantly improves both the speed and memory efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for mobile GPUs, showing promise for practical mobile 3D scene reconstruction applications.

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Upsample Anything,' a test-time optimization framework for restoring high-resolution pixel-wise outputs efficiently without requiring retraining, showcasing state-of-the-art results in upsampling feature maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of Vision Foundation Models in pixel-level applications due to their downsampled features, and to eliminate dependency on dataset-specific retraining or heavy optimization.

Method: Upsample Anything uses per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling.

Result: It achieves high-resolution feature restoration efficiently in $\approx 0.419 \text{s}$ per image, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and map upsampling.

Conclusion: Upsample Anything serves as an efficient edge-aware operator that generalizes across architectures and modalities, unlocking scalability and precise reconstruction capabilities for Vision Foundation Models.

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel perspective of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) by presenting them as analogous to topic models and introduces a framework called SAE-TM for better thematic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use and value of Sparse Autoencoders in embedding analysis lack clarity, prompting a need to understand their potential as tools for thematic exploration.

Method: SAEs are reinterpreted using a topic model approach, extending Latent Dirichlet Allocation for embedding spaces, with SAE-TM introduced to enhance coherence and functionality of learned topics.

Result: SAE-TM outperforms competitive baselines on text and image data, providing more coherent and diverse topics, and facilitating thematic analysis across modalities.

Conclusion: Sparse Autoencoders, reframed as tools for theme generation, are demonstrated to be effective for large-scale thematic analysis across diverse data modalities.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: The paper proposes BioBench, an ecology-focused vision benchmark that addresses the shortcomings of ImageNet for scientific imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ImageNet’s linear-probe transfer accuracy is insufficient for evaluating performance on scientific datasets, particularly ecology-related tasks.

Method: The authors developed BioBench, which includes 9 tasks, 4 taxonomic kingdoms, 6 data modalities, and 3.1 million images. It uses a Python API to evaluate models with lightweight classifiers on specific tasks.

Result: BioBench reveals that ImageNet accuracy explains only 34% of variance in ecology-related tasks while misranking models. BioBench offers better benchmarks for evaluating scientific imagery.

Conclusion: BioBench highlights the need for task-specific benchmarks for AI in science domains and provides a framework for creating such benchmarks.

Abstract: ImageNet-1K linear-probe transfer accuracy remains the default proxy for visual representation quality, yet it no longer predicts performance on scientific imagery. Across 46 modern vision model checkpoints, ImageNet top-1 accuracy explains only 34% of variance on ecology tasks and mis-ranks 30% of models above 75% accuracy. We present BioBench, an open ecology vision benchmark that captures what ImageNet misses. BioBench unifies 9 publicly released, application-driven tasks, 4 taxonomic kingdoms, and 6 acquisition modalities (drone RGB, web video, micrographs, in-situ and specimen photos, camera-trap frames), totaling 3.1M images. A single Python API downloads data, fits lightweight classifiers to frozen backbones, and reports class-balanced macro-F1 (plus domain metrics for FishNet and FungiCLEF); ViT-L models evaluate in 6 hours on an A6000 GPU. BioBench provides new signal for computer vision in ecology and a template recipe for building reliable AI-for-science benchmarks in any domain.

TL;DR: NaTex is a framework for generating 3D textures directly in 3D space, addressing limitations of prior methods reliant on 2D multi-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inherent limitations of existing MVD-based texture generation approaches, such as occlusion handling, cross-view consistency, and mesh-texture alignment issues.

Method: NaTex introduces latent color diffusion, comprising a geometry-aware color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), leveraging direct 3D information for texture prediction.

Result: NaTex significantly outperforms prior approaches in texture coherence and alignment, showing strong performance and generalization across various applications.

Conclusion: NaTex provides a novel and effective framework for 3D texture generation that enhances precision, coherence, and generalization, addressing key issues in previous methods.

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

TL;DR: This paper introduces WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient underwater image enhancement network, to restore visibility and color distortions for practical real-time use on limited-computing platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of existing underwater image enhancement methods make them unsuitable for real-time applications.

Method: The proposed WWE-UIE integrates three domain priors: adaptive white balance, wavelet-based multi-band decomposition, and gradient-aware edge preservation.

Result: WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with much fewer parameters and operations, suitable for real-time inference on resource-limited devices.

Conclusion: WWE-UIE successfully combines efficiency and effectiveness using interpretable priors, demonstrating its potential for practical underwater imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

TL;DR: ChangeDINO is a deep learning framework that improves robustness for building change detection in bi-temporal remote sensing images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RSCD methods often lack robustness due to an underutilization of semantic information in non-changing regions, causing issues under variations like illumination and view angle.

Method: ChangeDINO employs a multiscale Siamese framework combining a lightweight backbone and features from DINOv3. It uses a differential transformer decoder for change detection and a learnable morphology module for boundary refinement.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks showcase superior IoU and F1 scores compared to other methods, affirming effectiveness of the proposed components.

Conclusion: ChangeDINO offers improved performance and robustness in RSCD tasks, providing a reliable solution with its innovations.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome limitations of fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations in existing face super-resolution techniques.

Method: ARASFSR integrates implicit representation networks with three novel designs: 2D deep feature mapping for arbitrary up-scaling, a local frequency estimation module for texture detail, and a global coordinate modulation module for resolution adaptability.

Result: ARASFSR demonstrates improved robustness and better super-resolution performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across diverse input sizes and scales.

Conclusion: ARASFSR effectively enables arbitrary-scale and resolution face super-resolution while overcoming key limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve terrain and landform classification via UAVs by addressing data limitations and temporal inconsistencies.

Method: Using a teacher-student architecture combined with key frame selection and updating algorithms for weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation.

Result: The method achieves higher mean IoU and temporal consistency, using only 30% labeled data for stable terrain localization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances UAV aerial positioning tasks, reducing labeled data requirements and improving key metrics.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

### [150] [Multi-Order Matching Network for Alignment-Free Depth Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16361)
*Zhengxue Wang,Zhiqiang Yan,Yuan Wu,Guangwei Gao,Xiang Li,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOMNet, an alignment-free framework for depth super-resolution that addresses misalignment challenges between RGB and depth data by using a multi-order matching mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of misalignment between RGB and depth data caused by hardware limitations and environmental factors in real-world scenarios.

Method: The proposed approach, MOMNet, uses a multi-order matching mechanism (zero-order, first-order, and second-order) to identify relevant RGB data and a multi-order aggregation strategy for effectively integrating the RGB and depth features.

Result: MOMNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and high robustness in handling misaligned RGB-D data across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively resolves the issue of misalignment in RGB-D data, providing a robust and superior solution for real-world depth super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing offline signature verification using fine-grained local feature matching to address performance issues with holistic models and transformer-based architectures.

Method: Introduced DetailSemNet with a Detail Semantics Integrator to disentangle and re-entangle features, focusing on local structures to improve OSV accuracy.

Result: DetailSemNet outperformed leading benchmarks in offline signature verification, demonstrated superior generalizability in cross-dataset scenarios, and offered enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: DetailSemNet's focus on local structural matching enhances accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability, paving the way for robust real-world applications.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

*Pan Yang,Cheng Deng,Jing Yang,Han Zhao,Yun Liu,Yuling Chen,Xiaoli Ruan,Yanping Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CAMS, a system for compositional zero-shot learning that improves semantic disentanglement and generalization by leveraging cross-attention and multi-space methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current CLIP-based zero-shot learning methods, which struggle with disentangling attributes and objects due to restricted semantic representation capabilities.

Method: CAMS uses Gated Cross-Attention to extract fine-grained semantic features and performs Multi-Space Disentanglement to separate attribute and object semantics, leveraging high-level encoding blocks of CLIP.

Result: CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance on CZSL tasks in both closed-world and open-world settings, validated on benchmarks MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA.

Conclusion: The proposed CAMS method enhances the semantic disentanglement and improves generalization capabilities in CZSL tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Rigid Body Marker (RBM) to simplify motion capture (MoCap) with unambiguous 6-DoF data and proposes a deep-learning model using geodesic loss for accurate and efficient SMPL parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in traditional marker-based MoCap, such as complexity in setup and scalability limitations, by developing a simplified and more efficient data modality.

Method: The paper introduces RBM as a simplified and unambiguous data source. It also develops a deep-learning regression model with geodesic loss to estimate SMPL parameters efficiently. The approach is trained on the AMASS dataset.

Result: The proposed model matches traditional optimization methods in accuracy while being significantly faster and achieves state-of-the-art results in body pose estimation using synthesized and real-world data.

Conclusion: The combined use of RBM and geodesic loss enables a scalable, practical, and accurate solution for real-time MoCap applications in graphics and biomechanics.

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-camera depth estimation suffer from inconsistencies between overlapping views, impacting the performance of 3D perception across a 360° field of view.

Method: The proposed method uses a geometry-guided approach with calibrated multi-camera rigs. It employs neighborhood relations projected onto a shared unit cylinder and spatial attention to enhance depth estimation.

Result: Evaluation on DDAD and nuScenes datasets demonstrates improved cross-view consistency and overall depth accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses limitations in multi-camera depth estimation, offering dense, consistent, and accurate depth maps suitable for 3D perception applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent surgical complications by accurately identifying anatomy in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, addressing challenges in occlusions, long-range dependencies, and rare structure geometry.

Method: Two models integrate Vision Transformers with Graph Neural Networks: a static k-NN graph with GCNII for stable information propagation, and a dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator with GAT for adaptive topology learning. Evaluated on Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k.

Result: Achieved 7-8% mIoU and 6% mDice improvement over baseline models, with anatomically coherent predictions on challenging structures.

Conclusion: The methods enhance segmentation performance and reliability, ensuring safer surgeries through precise anatomical identification.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

*Jin Wang,Bingfeng Zhang,Jian Pang,Mengyu Liu,Honglong Chen,Weifeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture for few-shot segmentation, utilizing target property descriptions derived from large language models to improve accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation methods struggle with intra-class variations and inaccuracies in guidance derived from support images. The authors aim to replace support image-based meta guidance with unbiased and robust language-driven support strategies.

Method: The LDAG architecture leverages multi-attribute descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs) through its Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, and refines cross-modal interactions with a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) mechanism to address text-vision discrepancies.

Result: The proposed LDAG method shows superior performance over existing approaches by achieving state-of-the-art results in few-shot segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Unbiased meta guidance through language-driven attribute generalization significantly improves few-shot segmentation, providing a robust strategy for handling novel, untrained classes. The method successes in addressing text-vision modal misalignment.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses the challenge of monitoring overflowing waste containers in urban areas, introducing a dataset called StreetView-Waste for waste container detection, tracking, and overflow segmentation, alongside proposed heuristic and geometric-prior-based strategies to enhance baseline performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the problem of effectively monitoring overflowing urban waste containers, especially from images captured by garbage trucks, as existing datasets lack specific container tracking and real-world contextual data.

Method: The study introduces the StreetView-Waste dataset, focuses on tasks like waste container detection, tracking, and overflow segmentation, and provides baselines using state-of-the-art models in detection, tracking, and segmentation. It also proposes enhancements (heuristics and geometric priors) for improved performance.

Result: Experimental results indicate that fine-tuned object detectors perform reasonably well in detecting containers, proposed heuristics reduce counting errors by 79.6%, and geometry-aware strategies improve litter segmentation performance on lightweight models by 27%.

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste establishes a challenging benchmark that could stimulate further research into perception systems for urban waste management, showing potential improvements in detection, tracking, and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLA-Pruner, an efficient token pruning method designed for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models which balances semantic relevance and action execution requirements, enhancing performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous visual streams in Vision-Language-Action models demand high computational resources, and current token pruning methods neglect the dual needs for semantic understanding and action execution.

Method: VLA-Pruner employs a dual-level importance criterion combining semantic-level relevance and action-level importance using prefill attention and temporal smoothing, respectively, to retain essential tokens for both tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of VLA-Pruner across various Vision-Language-Action architectures and robotic tasks, proving its efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: VLA-Pruner effectively bridges the gap in enhancing Vision-Language-Action models by enabling efficient token pruning tailored to their dual-system requirements, achieving better real-time deployment capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LLaVA$^3$, a method to enhance VLM for 3D scene understanding using multi-view 2D images and omnidirectional visual representations, avoiding direct 3D data training. Experiments show better results than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of 3D training data compared to abundantly available 2D datasets hampers the development of multi-modal language models for 3D scene understanding.

Method: LLaVA$^3$ generates omnidirectional visual representations of 3D scenes using multi-view 2D images derived from intermediate 3D reconstructions, inspired by Cubist art. It requires no fine-tuning on 3D datasets.

Result: Experiments on 3D visual question answering (3D VQA) and 3D language grounding confirm that LLaVA$^3$ achieves superior performance over previous 2D-based approaches.

Conclusion: LLaVA$^3$ demonstrates an effective way to improve 3D scene understanding in VLMs by leveraging multi-view 2D images and intermediate 3D reconstructions, eliminating the need for extensive 3D-specific data.

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pruning method for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) models, enhancing compression while preserving visual fidelity even at high compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize resource-intensive 3D-GS representations for devices with limited storage and memory, addressing the degradation of visual fidelity at high compression ratios.

Method: Proposes a sensitivity pruning score based on second-order reconstruction error approximations and introduces a prune-refine pipeline for pretrained 3D-GS models.

Result: Achieves 90% Gaussian pruning, increases rendering speed by 3.56×, maintains foreground information, and improves image quality on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively compresses 3D-GS models, making them more suitable for resource-constrained devices while enhancing rendering speed and visual quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis have enabled real-time rendering speeds with high reconstruction accuracy. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), a foundational point-based parametric 3D scene representation, models scenes as large sets of 3D Gaussians. However, complex scenes can consist of millions of Gaussians, resulting in high storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.

Motivation: Current research demands efficient tools for analyzing the corpus callosum for applications in aging, neurological diseases, and clinical trials. Existing tools are limited in providing comprehensive morphometric analysis.

Method: FastSurfer-CC automatically segments and analyzes corpus callosum and fornix, calibrates head positioning, generates morphometric profiles and subdivisions, and extracts shape metrics for statistical analysis.

Result: FastSurfer-CC outperformed specialized tools in multiple tasks and identified statistically significant differences in corpus callosum metrics between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls, where other methods failed.

Conclusion: FastSurfer-CC is a powerful tool for corpus callosum morphometry with improved accuracy and novel capabilities for detecting neurological differences, advancing research and clinical applications.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the challenges of video prediction in occluded scenarios by utilizing motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps), showing improved performance using these enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study lies in addressing the inherent challenge of occlusion in video prediction, particularly in contexts like robotics and world modeling.

Method: The researchers modified a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to include depth and point-flow information, allowing it to better handle occluded scenarios. Evaluations used both synthetic and real-world datasets, emphasizing appearance and motion distribution metrics.

Result: The proposed model, augmented with depth and point-flow information, demonstrated improved performance in occluded video prediction and background motion compared to models without these features.

Conclusion: Incorporating explicit motion and geometric structure into video prediction models can significantly enhance their performance in occluded and complex scenarios, as shown by their improved metrics during evaluations.

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation methods for optical microrobots depend heavily on large, high-quality image datasets that are expensive and challenging to create due to microrobot fabrication complexity and intensive labeling efforts.

Method: The approach integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create high-fidelity synthetic microscope images efficiently.

Result: The proposed method improves SSIM by 35.6% over AI-driven methods, achieves real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame), and enables a pose estimator to reach 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy with generalization to unseen poses.

Conclusion: This framework offers a cost-effective, accurate solution for data augmentation and robust microrobot pose estimation, reducing dependency on real data and expanding possibilities for new configurations.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

*Rui Wang,Yuexi Du,John Lewin,R. Todd Constable,Nicha C. Dvornek*

TL;DR: This study presents a tumor segmentation method for breast DCE-MRI that incorporates acquisition time information to enhance model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated tumor segmentation remains challenging due to variations in tissue appearance caused by diverse acquisition protocols and individual factors.

Method: The proposed method employs feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers to integrate acquisition times into the model, enabling better utilization of temporal information.

Result: Models incorporating acquisition time demonstrated improved segmentation performance and generalization on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal knowledge using FiLM layers enhances tumor segmentation in breast DCE-MRI, addressing challenges due to differing acquisition protocols and individual variations.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to jointly map indoor scenes and register ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) by using egocentric RGB-D camera data and CMC videos, synchronized and optimized with a factor graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Registering CMCs to indoor scenes is challenging due to inefficiency of manual tools and poor results of current visual localization caused by visual ambiguity.

Method: A mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera captures data while CMCs record the agent. Data is synchronized via timestamps, followed by a customized factor graph for joint optimization of cameras, scene layout, and CMC poses.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates effective indoor scene mapping and CMC registration, simultaneously improving the performance of both tasks. A benchmark dataset is introduced as well.

Conclusion: The framework reliably maps indoor scenes, registers CMCs, and facilitates position-aware applications while setting a benchmark for relevant tasks.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of combat sports using computer vision has gained traction in recent years, yet the development of robust datasets remains a major bottleneck due to the dynamic, unstructured nature of actions and variations in recording environments. In this work, we present a comprehensive, well-annotated video dataset tailored for punch detection and classification in boxing.

This dataset is specifically curated to support research in real-time vision-based action recognition, especially in low-resource and unconstrained environments. By providing a rich benchmark with diverse punch examples, this contribution aims to accelerate progress in movement analysis, automated coaching, and performance assessment within boxing and related domains.

TL;DR: SemCLIP enhances CLIP models by addressing challenges posed by negation and paraphrasing using LLM-generated training triples, yielding improved robustness to semantic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve alignment and evaluation of vision-language models, especially addressing challenges posed by negation and paraphrasing, which disrupt semantic consistency.

Method: A novel CLIP contrastive loss function is introduced accounting for both paraphrasing and negation. It uses LLM-generated triples (original, paraphrased, negated texts) and trains models to adjust embeddings accordingly.

Result: SemCLIP achieves improved accuracy on negation-sensitive benchmarks (e.g., CC-Neg from 68.1% to 78.1%), and shows mixed but generally better performance on Sugarcrepe++ benchmarks. Additionally, enhanced zero-shot classification performance is demonstrated.

Conclusion: SemCLIP significantly improves robustness to semantic transformations compared to standard CLIP models, with notable gains in negation handling and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

TL;DR: Developed a robust multi-camera tracking system for gymnasts, successfully applied in international championships, overcoming challenges like limited cameras and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance tracking accuracy for gymnasts in competition settings despite limited cameras, lighting variations, and occlusions.

Method: Proposed a cascaded data association (DA) method combining multi-camera triangulation and ray-plane intersection to ensure robust gymnast tracking.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques in challenging scenarios and was successfully deployed at Gymnastics World Championships.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge enables accurate and robust gymnast tracking, earning acclaim from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

*Jaime Álvarez Urueña,David Camacho,Javier Huertas Tato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage detection framework is proposed to address the difficulty in detecting synthetic images generated by AI models, achieving high accuracy and adaptability without frequent retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of generative AI models has made synthetic image detection harder, challenging digital media integrity due to their rapid evolution.

Method: The framework uses supervised contrastive learning for feature extraction and a few-shot k-NN classifier for distinguishing synthetic images with minimal data samples.

Result: The framework achieves 91.3% average detection accuracy with only 150 images per class, outperforming existing methods significantly.

Conclusion: This approach offers enhanced accuracy and adaptability for detecting synthetic images and source attribution while minimizing the need for frequent model retraining.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Motivation: The study aims to improve satellite imagery reconstruction quality and efficiency by addressing the limitations of preprocessing and external tools in the existing EOGS framework.

Method: EOGS++ directly processes raw panchromatic data, integrates bundle adjustment within training using optical flow techniques, avoids external optimization tools, and includes enhancements like early stopping and TSDF post-processing.

Result: EOGS++ achieved state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and efficiency, outperforming the original EOGS framework and NeRF-based methods, with a significant improvement in mean MAE errors on building reconstructions.

Conclusion: EOGS++ proves to be a superior method for reconstructing satellite imagery, preserving computational efficiency while advancing accuracy and geometric detail.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

TL;DR: The paper introduces VARiant, a model improving Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) efficiency by reducing memory and enabling flexible depth adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high memory overhead and inefficiencies in VAR models caused by cumulative KV caching during progressive multi-scale generation.

Method: VARiant uses equidistantly sampled subnets selected from a 30-layer VAR network. Early scales use the full network, while later scales utilize subnets sharing weights with the full network. A progressive training strategy is proposed to optimize both subnets and full networks.

Result: VARiant reduces memory consumption by 40-80% and achieves a significant speedup in image generation, maintaining competitive quality across configurations.

Conclusion: VARiant enables flexible, efficient deployment of VAR models with reduced memory and computational costs, offering scalable solutions for diverse applications.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

In a clinical study, doctors rated it 4.3/5 for accuracy and 4.6/5 for efficiency, confirming its deployment readiness in low-resource settings. Trained and tested on 2,141 children from AnthroVision and additionally evaluated on diverse cross-continent populations, including ARAN and an in-house collected CampusPose dataset, it achieves 0.79 recall, 0.82 AUC, and significantly lower anthropometric RMSEs, demonstrating reliable measurement in unconstrained pediatric settings. Cross-dataset results show up to 25% recall gain and up to 3.5 cm RMSE reduction using demographically matched knowledge bases. NutriScreener offers a scalable and accurate solution for early malnutrition detection in low-resource environments.

Method: The authors utilize point maps with explicit 3D coordinates on a 2D grid and propose a view-to-scene alignment strategy and POMA-JEPA architecture for geometric consistency across views. They also construct ScenePoint, a large-scale dataset for pretraining.

Result: Experiments demonstrate POMA-3D's effectiveness as a backbone for various 3D tasks, such as question answering, navigation, retrieval, and localization using purely geometric inputs.

Conclusion: POMA-3D successfully tackles issues in 3D representation learning, providing a robust model and dataset that enhance diverse 3D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset updates in medical segmentation models by enabling selective knowledge removal.

Method: A controllable unlearning technique using teacher-student distillation with LoRA-constrained subspace updates, adversarial optimization to enforce forgetting, and restoration refinement for retaining generalization.

Result: The method significantly reduces performance on targeted forget subsets while maintaining or improving performance on retain and validation datasets across ISIC and CHASE benchmarks.

Conclusion: LoRA-based subspace unlearning offers a practical and effective way to responsibly forget sensitive information in medical image analysis while maintaining overall model utility.

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Result: SAM2S achieves an improvement to 80.42 average J&F, surpassing the original SAM2 by 17.10 points, and delivers real-time inference at 68 FPS with strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning on SA-SV benchmark and the enhancements in SAM2S cater to surgical segmentation challenges effectively through robust mechanisms, with shared code and dataset available for further advancements.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization. Code and dataset will be released at https://jinlab-imvr.github.io/SAM2S.

### [179] [Improving Long-Tailed Object Detection with Balanced Group Softmax and Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16619)
*Satyam Gaba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves long-tailed object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance by enhancing Faster R-CNN and incorporating metric learning and k-NN inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in real-world object detection datasets, which degrades performance on rare categories.

Method: Enhancements to Faster R-CNN, Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS), and metric learning with k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) inference.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5% on LVISv1 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques improve classification performance for rare classes and advance long-tailed object detection.

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

*Angela Vivian Dcosta,Chunbo Song,Rafael Radkowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method, Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), for enhancing low-light images by simultaneously reducing noise and increasing sharpness using a multi-parameter optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of state-of-the-art guided methods that fail to enhance low-light images effectively due to their high noise and low brightness.

Method: The authors propose AGU, based on a machine learning approach, that associates multiple low-light and bright image characteristics, learned from a few sample image pairs.

Result: Experiments show that AGU can render high-quality images in real time and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for low-light imagery enhancement.

Conclusion: AGU demonstrates superior capability in enhancing low-light images efficiently, making it a practical solution for real-time and high-quality image processing.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

Motivation: There is a need for effective visually grounded 3D object reconstruction from natural images where occlusion and clutter are common.

Method: The paper proposes a human- and model-in-the-loop data annotation pipeline alongside a multi-stage training framework combining synthetic pretraining with real-world data alignment.

Result: SAM 3D shows substantial improvements, achieving a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: SAM 3D addresses the 3D data limitation through advanced annotation and training methods, setting new benchmarks for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction, with plans for code release and benchmark sharing.

Abstract: We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRIM to efficiently accelerate 3D Gaussian diffusion model generation by employing trajectory reduction and instance mask denoising, ensuring high output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian diffusion models face challenges due to slow generation times and limited scalability, stemming from computationally expensive denoising and post-processing steps.

Method: TRIM applies temporal and spatial trimming strategies, utilizing a selector model for evaluating primitives and introducing instance mask denoising to optimize computation.

Result: Experimental results validate that TRIM improves generation efficiency and quality in 3D Gaussian diffusion models.

Conclusion: TRIM effectively addresses scalability and efficiency challenges in 3D Gaussian diffusion models without compromising output quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

*Shuyu Cao,Chongshou Li,Jie Xu,Tianrui Li,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation framework addressing multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance issues, leveraging a late-decoupled architecture and a dual-branch supervision mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation for applications in embodied intelligence by solving multi-hierarchy conflicts and mitigating class imbalance issues.

Method: The method involves a late-decoupled framework with multiple decoders guided hierarchically and a semantic prototype-based dual-branch supervision mechanism.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and can enhance previous methods as plug-and-play components.

Conclusion: The late-decoupled structure and dual-branch supervision mechanism are effective in addressing multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance, making the framework useful for 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation.

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a teacher-guided pruning framework integrating knowledge distillation with importance score estimation for efficient and one-shot neural network compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational overhead of iterative train-prune-retrain cycles in neural network pruning.

Method: A teacher-guided pruning approach combining Knowledge Distillation and gradient signals during importance score calculation, followed by sparsity-aware retraining.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet) showed high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computationally efficient and performance-preserving pruning strategy suitable for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cambrian-S was analyzed critically, showing its benchmarks and methods might not reliably measure spatial supersensing due to shortcut exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reliability of video world model benchmarks and methods, particularly for spatial supersensing improvements.

Method: This paper introduces baseline NoSense to test VSR, creates VSC-Repeat sanity check for VSC, and evaluates Cambrian-S approaches critically.

Result: Findings reveal benchmarks such as VSR and VSC can be solved using shortcuts rather than robust spatial supersensing techniques.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks and methods for spatial supersensing are prone to shortcut exploitation, raising concerns about their validity and robustness.

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing UV unwrapping methods, which struggle with noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned AI-generated meshes, leading to fragmented charts and distortion artifacts that hinder downstream tasks.

Method: PartUV uses a part-aligned approach built on PartField, combining semantic part decomposition and geometric heuristics in a recursive framework. It employs enhanced parameterization, packing algorithms, and dedicated handling for complex meshes, while ensuring low distortion and parallel processing for efficiency.

Result: Across four diverse datasets, PartUV surpasses existing methods in reducing chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, and demonstrates robustness on challenging meshes. It also supports new applications like multi-tile packing.

Conclusion: PartUV offers a robust, efficient UV unwrapping solution for challenging meshes, addressing key limitations of prior methods, and introducing new capabilities for 3D modeling applications.

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for realistic 3D animation and the challenges of generating 4D avatars with temporal consistency, motion accuracy, and computational efficiency necessitate significant advancements in modeling methods.

Method: TriDiff-4D adopts a diffusion-based triplane re-posing technique and an auto-regressive strategy to generate temporally coherent 4D avatars. It learns 3D and motion priors from extensive datasets and synthesizes 3D frames using diffusion models.

Result: The method reduces generation time from hours to seconds, delivers superior visual fidelity, and outperforms existing models in generating complex motions with accurate geometry and consistent temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: TriDiff-4D stands out as a highly efficient and effective solution for creating 4D avatars, offering substantial improvements in temporal coherence, motion control, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

TL;DR: SceneDesigner is a method for accurate and flexible control of 9D poses in multi-object image generation, leveraging CNOCS map representation and ObjectPose9D dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in controllability and quality of existing methods for 9D pose manipulation in multi-object image generation.

Method: SceneDesigner uses a branched network, CNOCS map representation, ObjectPose9D dataset, and a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning to achieve enhanced multi-object pose control.

Result: SceneDesigner significantly improves controllability and quality in multi-object 9D pose manipulation, outperforming existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner offers a powerful solution for comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control, featuring improved performance, customization, and public accessibility.

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP) task and introduces a novel model, VANS, that uses reinforcement learning to align multimodal inputs for video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Videos can convey physical-world processes more intuitively than text alone, creating opportunities for procedural learning and exploration.

Method: The authors developed VANS, a system combining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) using reinforcement learning with a shared reward system.

Result: VANS delivers state-of-the-art performance in video event prediction and visualization based on procedural and predictive benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed VANS model effectively addresses challenges in multimodal understanding and dynamic video generation, unlocking new possibilities in procedural learning and creative tasks.

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DualMindVLM, a visual language model employing fast and slow thinking modes for improved efficiency and reasoning by using a simple reinforcement learning (RL) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing visual language models that rely on lengthy reasoning chains, which result in high computational costs.

Method: The study proposes a RL-based method with two stages: labeling data with fast or slow thinking modes based on output length and training the model using GRPO for dual-mode thinking.

Result: The DualMindVLM model outperforms the base model, achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual reasoning tasks, and maintains high token efficiency.

Conclusion: DualMindVLM offers an effective way to balance computational efficiency and reasoning performance by automating the decision between fast and slow thinking modes in visual reasoning.

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Result: EvoLMM shows consistent improvement, achieving upto 3% gains in multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks like ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision using only raw images.

Conclusion: EvoLMM demonstrates a simple, effective method for fully unsupervised self-improvement of multimodal models, positioning itself as a baseline for future research. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

### [193] [NoPo-Avatar: Generalizable and Animatable Avatars from Sparse Inputs without Human Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16673)
*Jing Wen,Alexander G. Schwing,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar is a method for creating animatable 3D human avatars from images without relying on pose inputs, achieving strong performance even with noisy pose estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurate reconstruction when human pose inputs are noisy, limiting broader applications. This paper aims to create avatars without reliance on poses to overcome this limitation.

Method: The paper introduces NoPo-Avatar, a system that reconstructs 3D human avatars using only images, avoiding pose dependency during test-time.

Result: NoPo-Avatar surpasses baselines in practical settings without ground-truth poses and performs comparably in lab setups using ground-truth pose information.

Conclusion: NoPo-Avatar removes reliance on human pose inputs, offering robust avatar reconstruction even in situations with noisy pose estimates.

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

### [194] [Dataset Distillation for Pre-Trained Self-Supervised Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16674)
*George Cazenavette,Antonio Torralba,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel dataset distillation method called Linear Gradient Matching, aiming to create compact synthetic datasets for training linear probes on pre-trained vision models while achieving competitive performance compared to real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As vision models increasingly utilize large, pre-trained self-supervised backbones instead of training from scratch, there is a need for methods to effectively distill datasets tailored for fine-tuning these pre-trained models.

Method: Linear Gradient Matching is proposed, which optimizes synthetic images to match gradients induced by real data on linear classifiers when extracted through pre-trained feature models.

Result: The synthetic datasets generated by the proposed method outperform all real-image baselines and demonstrate generalization across different pre-trained vision backbones, showing competitive results in tasks like training linear CLIP probes using DINO distilled datasets.

Conclusion: This method proves useful beyond training performance, offering benefits in fine-grained classification tasks and contributing to model interpretability by analyzing embedding space similarities and identifying sensitivity to spurious correlations.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces asymmetric tile buffering (ATB) for GEMM, which decouples input and output tile dimensions, achieving up to 4.54x speedup on AMD's XDNA2 AI Engine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency of general matrix multiplication (GEMM), a core operation in AI workloads, by addressing limitations in conventional symmetric tiling strategies.

Method: The authors propose asymmetric tile buffering (ATB), develop a performance model to analyze its benefits (higher arithmetic intensity) and costs (higher kernel switching overhead), and test the approach on AMD's XDNA2 AI Engine.

Result: Applying ATB achieved up to 4.54x speedup (from 4.8 to 24.6 TFLOPS) on mixed-precision GEMM, setting a performance record for the XDNA2 AI Engine.

Conclusion: ATB is practical, beneficial, and significantly enhances GEMM performance for AI workloads, particularly on specific hardware like AMD's XDNA2 AI Engine.

Abstract: General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is the computational backbone of modern AI workloads, and its efficiency is critically dependent on effective tiling strategies. Conventional approaches employ symmetric tile buffering, where the buffered tile size of the input $A$ along the dimension $M$ matches the output tile size of $C$.
  In this paper, we introduce asymmetric tile buffering (ATB), a simple but powerful technique that decouples the buffered tile dimensions of the input and output operands. We show, for the first time, that ATB is both practical and highly beneficial. To explain this effect, we develop a performance model that incorporates both the benefits of ATB (higher arithmetic intensity) and its overheads (higher kernel switching costs), providing insight into how to select effective ATB tiling factors. As a case study, we apply ATB to AMD's latest XDNA2 AI Engine (AIE), achieving up to a 4.54x speedup, from 4.8 to 24.6 TFLOPS on mixed-precision BFP16--BF16 GEMM, establishing a new performance record for XDNA2 AIE.

*Daniel Mas Montserrat,Ray Verma,Míriam Barrabés,Francisco M. de la Vega,Carlos D. Bustamante,Alexander G. Ioannidis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in resource utilization and runtime in genomic workflows by introducing adaptive mechanisms for parallelization and scheduling of chromosome-level tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Genomic workflows in precision medicine encounter challenges in handling large datasets, high memory demands, and task failures due to the variability of resource requirements.

Method: Three adaptive approaches are proposed: symbolic regression for memory estimation, dynamic scheduling using polynomial regression for optimal task batching, and a static scheduler for chromosome processing order optimization.

Result: The methods significantly reduce memory overruns and improve load balancing across threads, leading to faster execution on genomic pipelines.

Conclusion: The work enhances resource efficiency and performance in large-scale genomic workflows which is critical for precision medicine applications.

Abstract: Large-scale genomic workflows used in precision medicine can process datasets spanning tens to hundreds of gigabytes per sample, leading to high memory spikes, intensive disk I/O, and task failures due to out-of-memory errors. Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses I/O performance issues in HPC systems by proposing a self-adaptive method using Control Theory to optimize client-side I/O rates, achieving significant runtime reduction and performance stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems often face unpredictable performance due to resource congestion, slowdowns, and timeouts in shared environments. Existing solutions can be expertise-heavy and workload-specific, making it challenging to generalize along diverse I/O scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a self-adaptive approach based on Control Theory. It dynamically adjusts client-side I/O rates using runtime system metrics, integrating this strategy into a multi-node cluster for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on a testbed showed that the proposed method reduces total runtime by up to 20%, lowers tail latency, and ensures stable performance during I/O operations.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective solution for mitigating I/O congestion in HPC systems, enhancing overall throughput and performance stability without the complexity associated with traditional optimization techniques.

Abstract: Efficient data access in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems is essential to the performance of intensive computing tasks. Traditional optimizations of the I/O stack aim to improve peak performance but are often workload specific and require deep expertise, making them difficult to generalize or re-use. In shared HPC environments, resource congestion can lead to unpredictable performance, causing slowdowns and timeouts. To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive approach based on Control Theory to dynamically regulate client-side I/O rates. Our approach leverages a small set of runtime system load metrics to reduce congestion and enhance performance stability. We implement a controller in a multi-node cluster and evaluate it on a real testbed under a representative workload. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates I/O congestion, reducing total runtime by up to 20% and lowering tail latency, while maintaining stable performance.

### [199] [Optimizing Communication in Byzantine Agreement Protocols with Slim-HBBFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15957)
*Nasit S Sony,Xianzhong Ding*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Slim-HBBFT, a protocol enhancing traditional Byzantine agreement in asynchronous networks, focusing on efficiency and reducing complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols are costly and inefficient when parties have duplicated requests, creating unnecessary communication and resource consumption.

Method: Slim-HBBFT utilizes a prioritized provable-broadcast (P-PB) protocol to selectively process requests from only a fraction of parties, reducing communication complexity and resources needed.

Result: Slim-HBBFT shows significant improvement in communication complexity, scaling better by a factor of O(n), while maintaining security integrity and reliability.

Conclusion: Slim-HBBFT effectively optimizes asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols by addressing communication inefficiencies and ensuring robust security compliance.

Abstract: Byzantine agreement protocols in asynchronous networks have received renewed interest because they do not rely on network behavior to achieve termination. Conventional asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols require every party to broadcast its requests (e.g., transactions), and at the end of the protocol, parties agree on one party's request. If parties agree on one party's requests while exchanging every party's request, the protocol becomes expensive. These protocols are used to design an atomic broadcast (ABC) protocol where parties agree on $\langle n-f \rangle$ parties' requests (assuming $n=3f+1$, where $n$ is the total number of parties, and $f$ is the number of Byzantine parties). Although the parties agree on a subset of requests in the ABC protocol, if the requests do not vary (are duplicated), investing in a costly protocol is not justified. We propose Slim-HBBFT, an atomic broadcast protocol that considers requests from a fraction of $n$ parties and improves communication complexity by a factor of $O(n)$. At the core of our design is a prioritized provable-broadcast (P-PB) protocol that generates proof of broadcast only for selected parties. We use the P-PB protocol to design the Slim-HBBFT atomic broadcast protocol. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis to demonstrate that Slim-HBBFT satisfies the properties of the Asynchronous Common Subset protocol, ensuring robust security and reliability.

TL;DR: SpecActor proposes efficient speculative decoding to accelerate LLM post-training rollout while ensuring output correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speeding up the training time during the post-training rollout of large language models (LLMs).

Method: Introduces dynamic decoupled speculation and dynamic Best-of-N speculation methods for efficient parallel verification and optimal drafting strategies.

Result: Achieves 1.3–1.7x speedup over common post-training baselines and 1.3–1.5x speedup compared to naive speculative decoding.

Conclusion: SpecActor significantly improves speculative rollout performance and efficiency in LLM training without additional computational resources.

Abstract: Rollout dominates the training time in large language model (LLM) post-training, where the trained model is used to generate tokens given a batch of prompts. SpecActor achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast path (e.g., a smaller model) to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges in speculative rollout by (1) a \emph{dynamic decoupled speculation} execution method that maximizes the GPU computational efficiency to realize speedup for large-batch execution -- a configuration common in training but unfriendly to speculative execution and (2) a \emph{dynamic Best-of-N speculation} method that selects and combines different drafting methods according to the rollout progress. It substantially improves the speculation accuracy even when the best drafting method is unknown a priori, meanwhile without requiring adding extra computation resources. {\sys} is {1.3--1.7}\,$\times$ faster than common post-training baselines, and is {1.3--1.5}\,$\times$ faster compared to naively adopting speculative decoding for rollout.

TL;DR: Federated Learning faces challenges with large models, including communication and memory constraints. NVIDIA FLARE addresses these using message quantization and efficient streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of federated learning when dealing with large language models, which face critical resource and communication bottlenecks.

Method: The authors introduce advanced communication techniques like quantization to reduce message size and container/file streaming for efficient memory management within the NVIDIA FLARE SDK.

Result: These techniques improve scalability, robustness, and efficiency in federated learning workflows involving large language models.

Conclusion: NVIDIA FLARE's enhancements ensure better integration and practical deployment of FL with large language models, addressing key resource and overhead issues.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for training machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces critical challenges related to communication overhead and local resource constraints, especially in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. The sheer size of these models exacerbates both memory and communication constraints, making efficient transmission and processing essential for practical deployment. NVIDIA FLARE, an open-source SDK for federated learning, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced communication capabilities. Building upon existing solutions for large object streaming, we enhance FL workflows for LLMs through two key techniques: message quantization and container/file streaming. Quantization reduces message size, while streaming enables efficient memory management, improving scalability and integration with existing workflows. These advancements significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of FL with LLMs, ensuring better performance in real-world federated learning scenarios.

### [202] [Distributed MIS Algorithms for Rational Agents using Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16533)
*Nithin Salevemula,Shreyas Pai*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses the computation of Maximal Independent Sets (MIS) in distributed networks with rational agents, proposing algorithms using pairwise interactions for randomness that are compatible with rational behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical MIS algorithms assume honest behavior and symmetry breaking, but fail in rational settings as agents may manipulate randomness or face unfairness.

Method: Two algorithms are proposed based on rational utility models, using pairwise node interactions for randomness without unilateral manipulation.

Result: The algorithms ensure no agent can increase its utility through unilateral deviation and guarantee all nodes have a positive probability of joining the MIS, terminating in O(log n) rounds with high probability.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms achieve correct MIS formation while addressing fairness and compatibility with rational behavior, providing robust guarantees.

Abstract: We study the problem of computing a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) in distributed networks where each node is a rational agent whose payoff depends on whether it joins the MIS. Classical distributed algorithms assume that nodes follow the prescribed protocol, but this assumption fails when nodes are strategic and may deviate if doing so increases their expected utility.
  Standard MIS algorithms rely on honest randomness or unique identifiers to break symmetry. In rational settings, however, agents may manipulate randomness, and relying solely on identifiers can create unfairness, giving some nodes zero probability of joining the MIS and thus no incentive to participate. To address these issues, we propose two algorithms based on a utility model in which agents seek locally correct solutions while also having preferences over which solution is chosen. Randomness in our algorithms is generated through pairwise interactions between neighboring nodes, viewed as simple games in which no single node can unilaterally affect the outcome. This allows symmetry breaking while remaining compatible with rational behavior.
  For both algorithms, we prove that at every stage of the execution, given any history, no agent can increase its expected utility through a unilateral deviation, assuming others follow the algorithm. This gives a stronger guarantee than Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium. When all nodes follow the protocol, every node has a positive probability of joining the MIS, and the final output is a correct MIS. Under mild additional assumptions, both algorithms terminate in $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test-time scaling in reasoning reinforcement learning is explored by introducing multi-dimensional methods, showing improved reasoning and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inherent limitations of test-time scaling caused by restricted context lengths in models.

Method: A unified approach, 3D test-time scaling, combines context, batch, and turn scaling methods to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: Each scaling dimension improves reasoning accuracy, but combining them provides substantial performance gains in diverse reasoning tasks like IOI, IMO, and CPHO.

Conclusion: The 3D test-time scaling framework is effective for improving reasoning in RL models and can extend to more complex tasks, including humanoid control domains.

Abstract: Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in operational forecasting of the ionosphere, such as sparse observations and complex coupling between geospatial layers, while meeting demands for accurate predictions critical to GNSS, satellite operations, aviation, and communications.

Method: The authors curated an open-access dataset combining solar and geomagnetic measurements (Solar Dynamic Observatory, F10.7 indices, solar wind parameters, etc.), along with geospatial ionospheric data (Global Ionospheric Maps, GNSS data, smartphone measurements). The dataset is prepared for machine learning applications, enabling forecasting of Total Electron Content (TEC).

Conclusion: This research contributes by providing a comprehensive dataset and pipeline, aiming to advance ionosphere forecasting and exploration of Sun-Earth interactions for scientific and operational benefits.

Abstract: Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Design verification in hardware is highly resource-intensive, requiring efficient stimulus generation to maximize coverage and reduce labor expense.

Method: The authors propose a framework called 'TB or not TB,' utilizing fine-tuned LLMs with Coverage-Driven Direct Preference Optimization (CD-DPO) and PairaNet dataset to improve stimulus generation.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrated up to 77.27% improvement in code coverage outperforming existing tools, showcasing the framework's advantages.

Conclusion: Coverage-driven optimization via LLMs can significantly advance automated hardware verification processes, improving efficiency and effectiveness in generating test inputs.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in applying them to hardware design and verification. Among these stages, design verification remains the most time-consuming and resource-intensive phase, where generating effective stimuli for the design under test (DUT) is both critical and labor-intensive. We present {\it TB or not TB}, a framework for automated stimulus generation using LLMs fine-tuned through Coverage-Driven Direct Preference Optimization (CD-DPO). To enable preference-based training, we introduce PairaNet, a dataset derived from PyraNet that pairs high- and low-quality testbenches labeled using simulation-derived coverage metrics. The proposed CD-DPO method integrates quantitative coverage feedback directly into the optimization objective, guiding the model toward generating stimuli that maximize verification coverage. Experiments on the CVDP CID12 benchmark show that {\it TB or not TB} outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines, achieving up to 77.27\% improvement in code coverage, demonstrating the effectiveness of Coverage-driven preference optimization for LLM-based hardware verification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopoReformer, a pipeline for mitigating adversarial perturbations in text images by leveraging topological features without sacrificing structural integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sophisticated OCR systems can be misled by adversarial text image perturbations which pose risks to high-stakes applications. Existing solutions in this domain are limited and insufficiently robust.

Method: TopoReformer uses topology principles and a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space, enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks.

Result: Proposed method is tested on datasets like EMNIST and MNIST, successfully defending against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks, and OCR-specific watermark attacks (FAWA).

Conclusion: TopoReformer is a computationally efficient and model-agnostic defense pipeline that enhances text image recognition systems against a variety of adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Adversarially perturbed images of text can cause sophisticated OCR systems to produce misleading or incorrect transcriptions from seemingly invisible changes to humans. Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).

### [207] [Beyond Tsybakov: Model Margin Noise and $\mathcal{H}$-Consistency Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15816)
*Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Model Margin Noise (MM noise) assumption, which is weaker than the Tsybakov noise condition but still ensures enhanced $H$-consistency bounds for classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations of the Tsybakov noise condition and develop a framework for improved classification bounds.

Method: They establish a new assumption (MM noise) that is hypothesis-dependent and utilizes comparison with the Bayes-classifier to derive enhanced $H$-consistency bounds.

Result: Enhanced $H$-consistency bounds were derived under MM noise, outperforming Tsybakov-based bounds and smoothly interpolating at intermediate noise levels.

Conclusion: The MM noise condition enables better classification results under weaker assumptions, bridging gaps in current noise models.

Abstract: We introduce a new low-noise condition for classification, the Model Margin Noise (MM noise) assumption, and derive enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds under this condition. MM noise is weaker than Tsybakov noise condition: it is implied by Tsybakov noise condition but can hold even when Tsybakov fails, because it depends on the discrepancy between a given hypothesis and the Bayes-classifier rather than on the intrinsic distributional minimal margin (see Figure 1 for an illustration of an explicit example). This hypothesis-dependent assumption yields enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for both binary and multi-class classification. Our results extend the enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds of Mao, Mohri, and Zhong (2025a) with the same favorable exponents but under a weaker assumption than the Tsybakov noise condition; they interpolate smoothly between linear and square-root regimes for intermediate noise levels. We also instantiate these bounds for common surrogate loss families and provide illustrative tables.

### [208] [Attention-Based Feature Online Conformal Prediction for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15838)
*Meiyi Zhu,Caili Guo,Chunyan Feng,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces attention-based feature online conformal prediction (AFOCP) to enhance prediction sets via feature-space calibration and adaptive attention mechanisms, significantly reducing interval size while maintaining coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address standard online conformal prediction (OCP) limitations: simple nonconformity scores in output space and uniform treatment of historical observations, failing to adapt to non-stationarity or distribution shifts.

Method: AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks and uses an attention mechanism to adaptively weight historical data. This improves prediction sets by leveraging learned representations and prioritizing relevant observations.

Result: AFOCP achieves up to 88% reduction in prediction interval sizes compared to standard OCP while maintaining target coverage, confirmed through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: AFOCP improves prediction set compactness without compromising coverage, validating innovations in feature-space calibration and adaptive weighting mechanisms.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) wraps around any pre-trained predictor to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees that hold irrespective of temporal dependencies or distribution shifts. However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.

*Alexander Bakumenko,Janine Hoelscher,Hudson Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal ensemble model combining structured vitals data and unstructured clinical notes to predict in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with improved transparency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of transparency and robustness in existing machine learning models for predicting in-hospital mortality, which hinders their clinical adoption.

Method: The method involves a late-fusion ensemble combining predictions from a bidirectional LSTM model for vital signs and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for clinical notes, integrated using a logistic regression model.

Result: Using the MIMIC-III data, the ensemble achieved higher predictive performance compared to single models, with improved AUPRC and AUROC scores, while maintaining prediction calibration and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides competitive and reliable risk estimates with multilevel interpretability, which is essential for its adoption in clinical settings.

Abstract: Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.

*Peter Sharpe*

TL;DR: GLOBE is a new neural model utilizing boundary-element methods and equivariant ML for solving homogeneous PDEs, achieving groundbreaking accuracy improvements in predicting airfoil flow characteristics and supporting flexible mesh configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve machine learning-based surrogates for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) relevant for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE), addressing challenges in accuracy, generalizability, and practical utility.

Method: Introduced GLOBE, a compact neural surrogate model utilizing a combination of learnable Green's-function-like kernels, equivariant architecture, and boundary-element-inspired inductive biases.

Result: GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements (mean-squared error reduction up to 200x on the AirFRANS dataset), demonstrating qualitative enhancements in fluid prediction while handling non-watertight meshes efficiently.

Conclusion: Physics and domain-inspired inductive biases significantly enhance neural models' accuracy, generalizability, and practical applicability for PDE surrogates in industrial CAE workflows.

Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).

### [212] [Global Resolution: Optimal Multi-Draft Speculative Sampling via Convex Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15898)
*Rahul Krishna Thomas,Arka Pal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-draft speculative sampling method to accelerate autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) using a draft model and optimal token verification criterion with significant improvement in acceptance rate and decoding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the latency in autoregressive decoding for LLMs without compromising the quality of inference.

Method: The authors reformulate the optimal transport problem in speculative sampling to mitigate computational challenges, using subset selection via polymatroid theory and convex optimization for faster resolution.

Result: The method achieves 90% acceptance rate and under 100ms overhead per generated token in multi-draft speculative sampling, with negligible deviation from the target model.

Conclusion: The paper introduces an efficient multi-draft speculative sampling algorithm, resolving computational inefficiencies and significantly enhancing decoding performance for LLMs.

Abstract: Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of generative models that are restricted to specific modalities, hindering broad applicability in structure-based drug design.

Result: FuncBind demonstrates competitive performance in generating various molecular structures in silico and generates novel antibody binders in vitro. Additionally, it provides a new benchmark dataset for macrocyclic peptide generation.

Conclusion: FuncBind is a versatile and effective generative framework for diverse structure-conditioned drug design tasks, offering potential for advancements in molecular generation and applicability across atomic systems.

Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind.

We build NKIBench, a new benchmark suite of AWS Trainium accelerator kernels with varying complexity extracted from real-world LLM workloads to evaluate the effectiveness of AccelOpt. Our evaluation confirms that AccelOpt's capability improves over time, boosting the average percentage of peak throughput from $49\%$ to $61\%$ on Trainium 1 and from $45\%$ to $59\%$ on Trainium 2 for NKIBench kernels. Moreover, AccelOpt is highly cost-effective: using open-source models, it matches the kernel improvements of Claude Sonnet 4 while being $26\times$ cheaper.

TL;DR: This paper proposes TLT, a system to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) training for Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing efficiency bottlenecks associated with long-tail response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs with reasoning capabilities using RL suffers from inefficiency due to long-tail response generation, which wastes resources and inflates costs.

Method: The proposed TLT system uses adaptive speculative decoding, comprising two components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained during idle GPU times to align with the target model, and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which efficiently manages computational resources using a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs.

Result: TLT achieves a 1.7x speedup in RL training compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining model accuracy and producing a high-quality draft model as a byproduct.

Conclusion: TLT provides an effective solution for RL training of LLMs by accelerating training processes without sacrificing accuracy, offering efficiency and a deployable draft model.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.

Result: DiffuApriel achieves up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences while maintaining comparable performance to Transformer-based diffusion models.

Conclusion: Bidirectional state-space architectures provide a scalable and practical foundation for faster and memory-efficient text generation in masked diffusion language modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential decision-making tasks require scalable and efficient Gaussian Process inference, but current scalability remains limited in many scenarios.

Method: The method leverages solutions from smaller systems to enhance solver convergence for large linear systems in iterative Gaussian Process computation.

Result: The proposed technique achieves faster solver convergence and better Bayesian optimization performance under fixed computational constraints.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical improvement for GP inference, particularly in scenarios with incremental data, improving computational efficiency and optimization outcomes.

Abstract: Scalable Gaussian process (GP) inference is essential for sequential decision-making tasks, yet improving GP scalability remains a challenging problem with many open avenues of research. This paper focuses on iterative GPs, where iterative linear solvers, such as conjugate gradients, stochastic gradient descent or alternative projections, are used to approximate the GP posterior. We propose a new method which improves solver convergence of a large linear system by leveraging the known solution to a smaller system contained within. This is significant for tasks with incremental data additions, and we show that our technique achieves speed-ups when solving to tolerance, as well as improved Bayesian optimisation performance under a fixed compute budget.

Motivation: Current deep learning methods have not succeeded in replacing gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) for tabular data tasks, necessitating a better approach.

Result: iLTM consistently outperforms GBDTs and top-performing deep learning models across various tabular classification and regression tasks with minimal fine-tuning required.

Conclusion: iLTM bridges the gap between tree-based methods and deep learning, offering a robust framework for scalable and adaptable tabular data modeling.

Abstract: Tabular data underpins decisions across science, industry, and public services. Despite rapid progress, advances in deep learning have not fully carried over to the tabular domain, where gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) remain a default choice in practice. We present iLTM, an integrated Large Tabular Model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and retrieval within a single architecture. Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning. By bridging the gap between tree-based and neural methods, iLTM offers a new framework for tabular foundation models for robust, adaptable, and scalable tabular learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unfairness in data classification and improve fairness while incorporating privacy measures for sensitive attributes.

Method: The paper derives optimal mechanisms for binary sensitive attributes and develops a tractable optimization framework for multi-valued attributes within the local differential privacy paradigm.

Result: The proposed approach consistently reduces data unfairness and achieves a favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off, outperforming existing LDP mechanisms and fairness methods.

Conclusion: Local differential privacy (LDP) emerges as an effective pre-processing fairness technique that balances privacy, accuracy, and fairness in classification tasks.

Abstract: We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised machine learning framework for multi-fidelity learning in soil spectroscopy, leveraging large MIR spectral libraries and Variational Autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve soil property prediction via leveraging large MIR datasets and enabling cost-effective NIR-to-MIR conversions.

Method: A self-supervised learning approach using Variational Autoencoders on MIR data, combined with a spectrum conversion task (NIR to MIR), and downstream machine learning models for soil property prediction.

Result: The SSML framework showed similar or better prediction accuracy for all soil properties compared to baseline models. While NIR-to-MIR predictions were inferior to MIR, they surpassed NIR-only models.

Conclusion: Unified spectral latent spaces and SSML strategies are effective in improving soil property predictions, leveraging large MIR datasets even when using limited low-cost NIR data.

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised machine learning (SSML) framework for multi-fidelity learning and extended predictive soil spectroscopy based on latent space embeddings. A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ExCIR, a computationally efficient method for providing explainability in AI models, emphasizing correlation-aware attribution and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing global attribution methods struggle with computational demands, instability under correlated inputs, and scalability for large datasets, necessitating a practical solution for more transparent AI systems.

Method: ExCIR uses correlation impact ratios with robust centering and introduces BlockCIR for groupwise feature attribution, addressing issues caused by correlated inputs. It implements a lightweight protocol for efficient and scalable evaluations.

Result: ExCIR demonstrates reliable agreement with established baselines across diverse datasets, achieves consistent rankings, and cuts runtime with subset evaluations.

Conclusion: ExCIR offers efficient, scalable, and stable AI explainability suited for real-world applications, improving transparency and trust in complex models.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly essential as modern models become more complex and high-stakes applications demand transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance. Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \textsc{BlockCIR}, a \emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \emph{computationally efficient}, \emph{consistent}, and \emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.

*Chukwunonso Henry Nwokoye,Blessing Oluchi,Sharna Waldron,Peace Ezzeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper uses an agent-based SEIRV model with machine learning to predict infection and recovery trends in WSNs with synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epidemiological data absence in wireless sensor networks complicates forecasting and mitigation of digital pathogens.

Method: Agent-based implementation of the SEIRV model, simulation with NetLogo and Python, and ML regression algorithms for prediction.

Result: Predictions achieved high R^2 for training (up to 1.000) and reasonable validation performance, best-performing algorithms include Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors.

Conclusion: Utilizing agent-based modeling and ML, the study demonstrated effective epidemic forecasts for WSNs and identified optimal regression algorithms.

Abstract: The lack of epidemiological data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a fundamental difficulty in constructing robust models to forecast and mitigate threats such as viruses and worms. Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data. Based on the recorded performances, support vector, linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regression were among the worst-performing algorithms, while Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors achieved the best results.

*Perrine Chassat,Van Tuan Nguyen,Lucas Ducrot,Emilie Lanoy,Agathe Guilloux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Developing synthetic control arms using a variational autoencoder (VAE) is proposed to address challenges in clinical trials, particularly for oncology and rare diseases, outperforming GAN-based methods in fidelity, utility, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the difficulties of fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and high costs in clinical trials, especially for oncology and rare diseases. Current generative methods for modeling time-to-event outcomes face limitations and poor performance.

Method: This study employs a VAE framework to jointly generate mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes, addressing issues of censoring and small sample sizes without assuming independent censoring.

Result: The VAE method showed superior performance compared to GAN baselines in terms of fidelity, utility, and privacy. It also uncovered systematic issues with type I error and power calibration and proposed a post-generation selection correction.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for synthetic control arms, particularly for substituting original datasets under privacy concerns or augmenting control arms to mitigate group imbalances. However, challenges remain in generative survival modeling calibration.

Abstract: Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.

### [224] [Descend or Rewind? Stochastic Gradient Descent Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15983)
*Siqiao Mu,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on machine unlearning methods, specifically stochastic Descent-to-Delete (D2D) and stochastic Rewind-to-Delete (R2D), providing certified guarantees for unlearning across diverse loss functions through probabilistic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create efficient machine unlearning algorithms that avoid the computational expense of retraining the model from scratch while maintaining provable unlearning guarantees.

Method: The authors analyze stochastic D2D and R2D algorithms using theoretical frameworks including disturbed gradient systems and probabilistic coupling, combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to ensure $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning for various types of loss functions.

Result: The paper provides theoretical guarantees for stochastic D2D and R2D in strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex settings, showing D2D achieves tighter results for strongly convex functions, while R2D is more effective in convex and nonconvex cases.

Conclusion: Stochastic R2D and D2D are validated as practical machine unlearning methods, with nuanced advantages depending on loss function properties.

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(ε, δ)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.

### [225] [Synergizing Deconfounding and Temporal Generalization For Time-series Counterfactual Outcome Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16006)
*Yiling Liu,Juncheng Dong,Chen Fu,Wei Shi,Ziyang Jiang,Zhigang Hua,David Carlson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of estimating counterfactual outcomes in time-series data by introducing two approaches, Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM), which together improve deconfounding and temporal generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the significant challenges in counterfactual outcome estimation for time-series data, mainly caused by unobserved counterfactual trajectories and the time-evolving confounders distorting estimations.

Method: The paper proposes a framework combining Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA), which refines treatment alignment using fine-grained sub-treatment groups, and Random Temporal Masking (RTM), a technique that replaces covariates randomly with noises to encourage temporal generalization.

Result: Individually, SGA and RTM show improvements in counterfactual estimation. Combined, they achieve state-of-the-art performance by enhancing deconfounding and temporal generalization.

Conclusion: The combined application of SGA and RTM proves highly effective, with each contributing distinct advantages: SGA focusing on improved deconfounding and RTM improving temporal robustness and causal relationship preservation.

Abstract: Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.

### [226] [ECPv2: Fast, Efficient, and Scalable Global Optimization of Lipschitz Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16575)
*Fares Fourati,Mohamed-Slim Alouini,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECPv2 is a scalable optimization algorithm for functions with unknown Lipschitz constants, addressing prior limitations like high cost and conservative behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions while tackling ECP challenges.

Method: ECPv2 employs adaptive bounds, memory mechanisms, and random projections to enhance scalability and efficiency.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates competitive performance and faster computation across various high-dimensional non-convex problems.

Conclusion: ECPv2 optimizes effectively with reduced computation time, overcoming previous limitations and providing no-regret guarantees.

Abstract: We propose ECPv2, a scalable and theoretically grounded algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.

### [227] [Physics-Guided Inductive Spatiotemporal Kriging for PM2.5 with Satellite Gradient Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16013)
*Shuo Wang,Mengfan Teng,Yun Cheng,Lothar Thiele,Olga Saukh,Shuangshuang He,Yuanting Zhang,Jiang Zhang,Gangfeng Zhang,Xingyuan Yuan,Jingfang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces SPIN, a novel deep learning framework, to accurately infer high-resolution PM2.5 pollution levels by incorporating physics-based models and addressing satellite data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spatial sparsity of ground monitoring for PM2.5 and limitations in traditional satellite data (AOD) methods hinder effective urban environmental management.

Method: SPIN integrates physical advection and diffusion models into deep learning using graph kernels. Instead of direct AOD input, AOD is used as a spatial loss constraint for robust modeling.

Result: Validated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, SPIN achieves Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, outperforming previous methods and offering robust pollution mapping even in unmonitored areas.

Conclusion: SPIN is a cost-efficient, accurate, and adaptable framework for continuous and reliable high-resolution PM2.5 mapping across diverse environments.

Abstract: High-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a cornerstone of sustainable urbanism but remains critically hindered by the spatial sparsity of ground monitoring networks. While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas. This work provides a robust, low-cost, and all-weather solution for fine-grained environmental management.

### [228] [CARE: Turning LLMs Into Causal Reasoning Expert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16016)
*Juncheng Dong,Yiling Liu,Ahmed Aloui,Vahid Tarokh,David Carlson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with causal discovery tasks due to their reliance on variable semantics rather than observational data. The proposed framework, CARE, enhances LLMs by fine-tuning them to use causal discovery algorithm outputs effectively, resulting in better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show strong reasoning and generation abilities, their inability to identify causal relationships—a critical aspect of human intelligence—limits their applicability in tasks requiring causal reasoning.

Method: The study first evaluates LLMs' causal reasoning behavior, then prompts them with outputs from established causal discovery algorithms. CARE fine-tunes LLMs using supervised training to improve their ability to utilize sufficient statistics from these algorithms.

Result: CARE-trained Qwen2.5-1.5B model outperforms both leading causal-discovery algorithms and larger state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating significant advancement in causal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs through CARE effectively bridges their causal reasoning gap, enabling them to integrate external statistical tools and outperform existing options in the domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.

*Yang Wu,Yifan Zhang,Zhenxing Liang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGCN2SP, a novel model that uses hierarchical graph convolutional networks and reinforcement learning, optimizes scenario selection in Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) problems under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving 2SP problems with numerous scenarios is challenging due to computational inefficiency, lack of deep scenario integration, and the impact of scenario order on solving time.

Method: The paper proposes the HGCN2SP model with a hierarchical graph for representing scenarios. The model utilizes reinforcement learning, a hierarchical graph convolutional network, and an attention-based decoder to optimize scenario selection and ordering.

Result: HGCN2SP achieves efficient, high-quality decisions in shorter computational times. It effectively handles large-scale instances with many scenarios, even those unseen during training.

Conclusion: HGCN2SP demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and efficiency in solving complex 2SP problems, offering a scalable and practical approach for decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.

*Peng Xia,Kaide Zeng,Jiaqi Liu,Can Qin,Fang Wu,Yiyang Zhou,Caiming Xiong,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agent0 is a self-evolution framework that autonomously trains AI agents using multi-step co-evolution and tool integration, independently of external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of LLMs and self-evolution frameworks that rely on human-curated data and static, single-round interactions for training, which hinder scalability and dynamic task-solving capabilities.

Method: Agent0 introduces a co-evolutionary framework with two agents: a curriculum agent that generates increasingly challenging tasks and an executor agent that learns to solve them. External tools are integrated to enhance the executor's skills, creating a cycle where both agents drive each other's growth.

Result: Agent0 significantly improves reasoning abilities of the Qwen3-8B-Base model, demonstrating an 18% improvement in mathematical reasoning and a 24% improvement in general reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: By combining autonomous curriculum generation, multi-step co-evolution, and tool integration, Agent0 demonstrates an effective methodology for enhancing AI reasoning capabilities independent of external data.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

### [231] [Change-of-Basis Pruning via Rotational Invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16061)
*Alex Ning,Vainateya Rangaraju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel pruning method called CoB pruning and a compatible activation function (TSRA), which enhances pruning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of structured pruning in deep learning by improving how importance is distributed across the representation space.

Method: They introduce change-of-basis (CoB) pruning, using orthogonal linear transformations, combined with two-subspace radial activations (TSRA) to maintain compatibility and achieve rotational invariance.

Result: CoB pruning improves accuracy over a baseline under structured pruning and extends the reliable pruning ratio up to 70%. At high pruning levels (90-96%), accuracy drops are limited after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Rotationally invariant architectures, demonstrated with the CoB+TSRA framework, offer a promising path towards effective structured pruning.

Abstract: Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.

*Yoonhyuk Choi,Chong-Kwon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GESC, a novel GNN model designed to improve performance on heterophilous graphs by addressing issues with self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs struggle on heterophilous graphs due to complications like phase inconsistency and self-reinforcing signals, prompting the need for improved mechanisms in graph processing.

Method: GESC replaces additive aggregation in GNNs with a projection-based interference mechanism using a $$ phase connection and rank-1 projection, alongside a sign- and phase-aware gate to regulate neighbor influence.

Result: The proposed method achieves consistent performance improvements over recent state-of-the-art models across various graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: GESC provides a unified and interference-aware perspective, addressing limitations of traditional graph message-passing methods, and successfully advancing GNN capabilities.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on homophilous graphs but often fail under heterophily due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals. We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing. Our code is available at \href{here}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GESC-1B22}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Learning with LoRA faces challenges under client heterogeneity, and ILoRA offers solutions through coherent initialization, improved aggregation methods, and enhanced optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the instability, rank incompatibility, and client drift challenges that hinder the performance of Federated Learning with LoRA under heterogeneous client setups.

Method: ILoRA introduces orthonormal initialization using QR decomposition, concatenated QR aggregation for rank alignment, and rank-aware AdamW optimizer to manage local update bias and mitigate client drift.

Result: Experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks confirm ILoRA's superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to other federated LoRA approaches.

Conclusion: ILoRA provides effective solutions to improve the performance, stability, and generalization of Federated Learning with low-rank adaptation under challenging heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) faces three critical challenges under client heterogeneity: (1) Initialization-Induced Instability due to random initialization misaligning client subspaces; (2) Rank Incompatibility and Aggregation Error when averaging LoRA parameters of different ranks, which biases the global model; and (3) exacerbated Client Drift under Non-IID Data, impairing generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift. Supported by theoretical convergence guarantees, extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that ILoRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to existing federated LoRA methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a refined resume evaluation model using a small language model fine-tuned with supervised learning and reinforcement learning, achieving 91% accuracy and addressing traditional ATS limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Applicant Tracking Systems are hindered by their rigid keyword-matching models, often denying qualified candidates due to minor semantic mismatches. This motivated the creation of a more sophisticated evaluation model.

Method: A two-step fine-tuning approach was adopted: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning established a baseline model, and (2) Reinforcement Learning, guided by a multi-component reward function, further refined the model while addressing challenges like reward hacking.

Result: The resulting model achieved a 91% accuracy on unseen test data, with high recall (0.85) and precision (1.0) in identifying qualified candidates, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This two-phase fine-tuning approach demonstrates that small language models can be optimized for human-like candidate scoring, addressing the limitations of traditional systems and naive reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable "gentle polishing process" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.

*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filters (AOPFs) to improve spectral GNNs, addressing stabilization and domain-specific trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of spectral GNNs, such as ChebyNet's static low-pass filter design that struggles with heterophily and over-smoothing.

Method: The authors propose two models (`L-JacobiNet` and `S-JacobiNet`) analyzing adaptive filters and stabilization effects in distinct polynomial domains ([0, ∞) and [-1, 1]).

Result: The [0, ∞) domain is favorable for heterophily modeling, and [-1, 1] offers numerical stability. However, a static model (`S-JacobiNet`) stabilized by LayerNorm outperforms adaptive ones on most benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain may lead to overfitting, and stabilization is crucial for improving ChebyNet. `S-JacobiNet` represents a robust baseline.

Abstract: Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the "Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AssayMatch enhances drug discovery ML models by filtering noisy data and curating homogenous datasets tailored to test sets, improving prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of noisy and inconsistent training datasets in drug discovery ML models, emphasizing the variability in bioactivity data across diverse sources.

Method: The authors developed AssayMatch, a framework that uses data attribution to evaluate training assay contributions and finetunes embeddings of assay descriptions for better data compatibility and quality.

Result: Models trained with data filtered by AssayMatch outperformed those using entire datasets in 9 out of 12 cases, showing enhanced predictive capability and reduced noise.

Conclusion: AssayMatch effectively curates datasets for greater model efficiency and accuracy in drug discovery, aiding in real-world scenarios where test labels are unavailable.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.

*Haohui Chen,Zhiyong Chen,Aoxiang Liu,Wentuo Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an enhanced double actor-critic framework with tunable bias using convex combinations to improve continuous control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deterministic policy gradient algorithms face value estimation biases that degrade performance. There is a need to explore double actors for better exploration potential and representation learning.

Method: Introduced three convex combination strategies, governed by a single hyperparameter, for balancing pessimistic (bias mitigation) and optimistic (exploration) estimates. Augmented actor and critic network representations are also employed.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms benchmarks, excelling by balancing bias and leveraging both overestimation and underestimation based on the environment.

Conclusion: Tunable bias via improved double actor-critic methods enhances representation learning and achieves superior continuous control performance.

Abstract: Deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control suffer from value estimation biases that degrade performance. While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.

*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HybSpecNet, a hybrid-domain GNN architecture, combining stable and adaptive branches to resolve stability and adaptivity trade-offs in spectral filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the stability-vs-adaptivity trade-off in spectral graph neural networks, where existing filters either are stable but low-pass or adaptive but prone to instability.

Method: The authors designed HybSpecNet, combining a stable ChebyNet branch and an adaptive KrawtchoukNet branch, utilizing late fusion to isolate gradient pathways and prevent instability.

Result: Naive hybrid architectures suffer from 'Instability Poisoning,' causing collapse at high polynomial degrees, but the advanced architecture with late fusion resolves these issues, achieving stability and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into hybrid GNN design, identifying pitfalls and presenting an effective solution for stability and adaptivity in spectral filtering.

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental "Stability-vs-Adaptivity" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a "naive" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as "Instability Poisoning," where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses "Late Fusion" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.

*Yuanbo Tang,Yan Tang,Zixuan Zhang,Zihui Zhao,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep generative model utilizing a pathlet representation for privacy-preserving trajectory generation, improving robustness, interpretability, and efficiency over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of robustness and interpretability in trajectory-generating models that limit their real-world applicability and trustworthiness.

Method: A deep generative model based on pathlet representation integrates a probabilistic graphical model, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and a linear decoder to learn trajectory structures and mobility patterns.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates significant improvements in generating trajectories on noisy data, outperforming baselines by 35.4% and 26.3%, while also being efficient in computational resources.

Conclusion: The model effectively provides privacy-preserving trajectory generation, adaptable for multiple downstream tasks, and achieves superior distribution learning and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.
  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a SHAP-guided framework for synthetic data generation to overcome limited access to social media emotion datasets, highlighting its strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Escalating API costs and platform restrictions have made accessing emotion-related social media training data expensive, necessitating viable alternatives.

Method: The study uses Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) integrated into an LLM-based synthetic generation process to create high-quality training data.

Result: The SHAP-guided method matches real data performance with sufficient seed data, outperforms naïve generation techniques, and enhances emotion classification, especially for underrepresented classes.

Conclusion: While the framework shows promise in data generation, synthetic text lacks vocabulary richness and authentic expression complexity, highlighting trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from social media is critical for understanding public sentiment, but accessing training data has become prohibitively expensive due to escalating API costs and platform restrictions. We introduce an interpretability-guided framework where Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide principled guidance for LLM-based synthetic data generation. With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms naïve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes. However, our linguistic analysis reveals that synthetic text exhibits reduced vocabulary richness and fewer personal or temporally complex expressions than authentic posts. This work provides both a practical framework for responsible synthetic data generation and a critical perspective on its limitations, underscoring that the future of trustworthy AI depends on navigating the trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity.

*Zhijie Zhong,Zhiwen Yu,Kaixiang Yang,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes STAND as a simple yet effective supervised model for time series anomaly detection, showing that limited labels outperform complex unsupervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labels can significantly enhance performance in time series anomaly detection, unlike the prevailing focus on complex architectures.

Method: Systematic comparison of supervised vs. unsupervised methods, introducing STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline model.

Result: Supervised models outperform unsupervised ones under limited labels, with higher consistency and better anomaly localization.

Conclusion: TSAD research should shift to a data-centric approach, utilizing labels rather than focusing solely on complex algorithmic designs.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

Motivation: Improving the flexibility of Nuclear Power Plants to complement the growth of renewable energies.

Method: Developing two surrogate models based on data-driven simulation from nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations.

Result: Both models rapidly integrate complex dynamics, reducing computational time by up to 1000x.

Conclusion: Surrogate models significantly enhance the efficiency of nuclear reactor core simulations, supporting the adaptability of nuclear power plants.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing need for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) to improve flexibility in order to match the rapid growth of renewable energies. The Operator Assistance Predictive System (OAPS) developed by Framatome addresses this problem through Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of making accurate and reliable wind power predictions for long prediction horizons, crucial for energy grid stability and market risk management.

Method: The authors developed a forecasting pipeline that processes ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power predictions, including post-processing to address biases and lack of dispersion.

Result: The pipeline demonstrated 50% better performance compared to a climatological baseline in terms of ranked probability skill score and mean squared error, and achieved near-perfect forecast calibration.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables more accurate and reliable long-term wind power forecasts, enhancing the utility of subseasonal-to-seasonal weather data in energy planning and management.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, balancing supply and demand, and market risk management. Even though short-term weather forecasts have been thoroughly used to provide short-term renewable power predictions, forecasts involving longer prediction horizons still need investigations. Despite the recent progress in subseasonal-to-seasonal weather probabilistic forecasting, their use for wind power prediction usually involves both temporal and spatial aggregation achieve reasonable skill. In this study, we present a forecasting pipeline enabling to transform ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times ranging from 1 day to 46 days at daily resolution. This framework also include post-processing of the resulting power ensembles to account for the biases and lack of dispersion of the weather forecasts. We show that our method is able to outperform a climatological baseline by 50 % in terms of both Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Ensemble Mean Squared Error while also providing near perfect calibration of the forecasts for lead times ranging from 15 to 46 days.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rumor detection remains challenging due to complex propagation patterns and the lack of interpretability in existing methods.

Method: CausalMamba integrates Mamba sequence modeling, GCNs, and causal discovery (NOTEARS) to uncover joint temporal features and causal graphs in rumor propagation.

Result: Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show competitive classification performance, along with the ability to conduct counterfactual intervention analysis.

Conclusion: The framework achieves explainable and effective rumor detection while enabling influence analysis, thus offering actionable insights into misinformation dynamics.

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media remains a challenging task due to the complex propagation dynamics and the limited interpretability of existing models. While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve online interval scheduling through leveraging machine-learned predictions while ensuring robust performance even under inaccurate predictions.

Method: Developed the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework combining classical algorithms and machine-learned predictions. Designed a randomized algorithm that smoothly transitions between predictive-based and robust approaches.

Result: The framework demonstrates effective trade-offs between consistency and robustness, with supported tight lower bounds. The randomized algorithm adapts seamlessly to prediction quality variations.

Conclusion: Incorporating predictions enhances interval scheduling performance, provided algorithms are designed to balance robustness and predictive accuracy effectively.

Abstract: We study online interval scheduling in the irrevocable setting, where each interval must be immediately accepted or rejected upon arrival. The objective is to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors.
  Our main contribution is the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness of this framework in particular settings.
  We further design a randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully with the quality of the prediction.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) using Causal Generative Models (CGMs) to overcome the lack of high-quality, accessible recruitment data for developing fair machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the scarcity of accessible, high-quality datasets in recruitment caused by privacy and regulatory constraints, which limits the development of fair and reliable machine learning models.

Method: The method involves specialized SDG using two Causal Generative Models (CGMs), each structured with causal graphs based on domain expertise, to model job offers and curricula vitae.

Result: The generated synthetic datasets are used to evaluate fairness in candidate ranking systems by introducing and analyzing specific biases under controlled scenarios.

Conclusion: Using CGMs for SDG in recruitment provides a viable way to preserve underlying causal relationships, enabling the development of fairer and more interpretable machine learning models in data-scarce domains.

Abstract: The importance of Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) has increased significantly in domains where data quality is poor or access is limited due to privacy and regulatory constraints. One such domain is recruitment, where publicly available datasets are scarce due to the sensitive nature of information typically found in curricula vitae, such as gender, disability status, or age. %
This lack of accessible, representative data presents a significant obstacle to the development of fair and transparent machine learning models, particularly ranking algorithms that require large volumes of data to effectively learn how to recommend candidates. In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. %
Recent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. %
In this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity challenges in nuclear energy, where experimental data are often limited, expensive, or difficult to obtain, the paper explores leveraging deep generative modeling to enrich datasets for predictive machine learning tasks.

Method: The researchers developed both a vanilla DM and a conditional DM using a public critical heat flux (CHF) dataset. The conditional DM can generate data tailored to specific thermal-hydraulic conditions. Model performance was validated by assessing empirical feature distributions, correlations, and physical consistency.

Result: Both DM and conditional DM successfully generated realistic, physics-consistent CHF data. The conditional DM demonstrated superior capability in targeted data generation under specified conditions and with acceptable uncertainty.

Conclusion: Diffusion models, particularly conditional DMs, are effective tools for overcoming data scarcity issues in nuclear energy applications, enabling robust dataset augmentation while quantifying uncertainty.

Abstract: Deep generative modeling provides a powerful pathway to overcome data scarcity in energy-related applications where experimental data are often limited, costly, or difficult to obtain. By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world agricultural datasets have severe class imbalances with long-tailed distributions. Training datasets, often balanced artificially, fail to reflect real-world scenarios, causing generalization issues.

Method: Introduces Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), which simulates label distribution skew using Dirichlet-distributed random variables during training, acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.

Result: DirPA adjusts decision boundaries and stabilizes training while improving few-shot learning under class-imbalanced conditions.

Conclusion: DirPA provides a proactive approach to address mismatches between training and real-world distributions, enhancing generalization for crop-type classification.

Abstract: Real-world agricultural distributions often suffer from severe class imbalance, typically following a long-tailed distribution. Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of uncertain communication delays in multi-stream cyber-physical systems and improve the temporal flow of real-time inference processes.

Method: The proposed method introduces neuro-inspired adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to adjust dynamically to stochastic communication delays without needing a reference-modality or costly offline profiling.

Result: The experiments on the AVEL task show that the proposed approach achieves superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to existing SotA non-blocking inference methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust and delay-aware inference mechanism, ensuring better performance in real-time tasks while offering improved control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff.

Abstract: Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm for solving two-player zero-sum games in high-dimensional spaces using function approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current successive over-relaxation Q-learning technique improves convergence speed but is limited to tabular setups, leaving high-dimensional real-world applications unexplored.

Method: The authors propose a deep learning-based adaptation of the successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm, employing deep neural networks for function approximation.

Result: The proposed algorithm is proven to converge in finite time. Experiments demonstrate improved performance and show the impact of different over-relaxation parameters via ablation studies.

Conclusion: The method extends existing Q-learning approaches to high-dimensional scenarios, showcasing faster and effective performance for complex game setups.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of a two-player zero-sum game. In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effect of different values of the crucial successive over-relaxation parameter.

*Yang Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques the pass@k metric in evaluating and optimizing large language models, showing its limitations as a reinforcement learning objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of the pass@k metric in improving reasoning abilities of LLMs and assess its usefulness as a direct optimization tool.

Method: Decoding the gradient of the pass@k metric, analyzing its relationship to pass@1, and examining exploration collapse dynamics in reinforcement learning.

Result: Pass@k is fundamentally a reweighting of pass@1, providing limited signals in critical exploration scenarios, and showing diminishing marginal utility as policy concentrates probability mass.

Conclusion: While pass@k serves as a diagnostic tool, its effectiveness as a direct optimization objective is limited, and more efficient exploration strategies are needed in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research. To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of "exploration collapse", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.

### [252] [GeoPTH: A Lightweight Approach to Category-Based Trajectory Retrieval via Geometric Prototype Trajectory Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16258)
*Yang Xu,Zuliang Yang,Kai Ming Ting*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel, lightweight hashing framework called GeoPTH for efficient trajectory retrieval, addressing limitations of traditional and learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome inefficiencies in computational costs of traditional metrics and training instabilities in learning-based trajectory retrieval methods.

Method: GeoPTH uses geometric trajectory prototypes and a robust Hausdorff metric to create data-dependent hash functions for category-based trajectory retrieval.

Result: GeoPTH achieves competitive retrieval accuracy while significantly surpassing traditional and learned methods in terms of efficiency.

Conclusion: GeoPTH is a practical alternative offering exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency through its lightweight, prototype-centric framework.

Abstract: Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{T}rajectory \textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of interpreting machine learning predictions on graph-structured data by proposing a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability in graph-structured data prediction models is lacking, and counterfactual explanations can address the challenge; however, graph counterfactuals remain underexplored.

Method: The authors propose the Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation framework, using discrete diffusion models combined with classifier-free guidance to generate explanations.

Result: The method is empirically shown to produce reliable, in-distribution, and minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete and continuous properties.

Conclusion: Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation is a promising approach for making graph-based ML models more interpretable through counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data, such as molecular graphs or social networks, often make accurate predictions but offer little insight into why certain predictions are made. Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. We empirically demonstrate that our method reliably generates in-distribution as well as minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete classification targets and continuous properties.

### [254] [Optimizing Operation Recipes with Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Interpretable Control of Chemical Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16297)
*Dean Brandner,Sergio Lucia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using reinforcement learning to fine-tune operation recipes and linear controllers for chemical processes, improving performance with fewer data and handling constraints effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning and model predictive control for chemical process optimization, such as data scarcity, computational complexity, and suboptimal performance in manual methods.

Method: The authors integrate expert knowledge from operation recipes and employ reinforcement learning to optimize recipe parameters and underlying linear controllers for chemical processes.

Result: Simulations on an industrial batch polymerization reactor show that the proposed method approaches the performance of optimal controllers while alleviating the challenges faced by traditional reinforcement learning and manual methods.

Conclusion: The proposed structured and interpretable approach optimizes chemical process operations with enhanced efficiency, enabling constraint handling, and minimal data requirements compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for more accurate state estimation in systems with uncertain dynamics, demonstrating systematic improvement over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional observer designs struggle with systems having uncertain dynamics, necessitating more robust methods.

Method: The proposed LEO framework optimizes system matrices using gradient-based minimization, improving state estimation accuracy in linear time-invariant systems.

Result: LEO achieves over 15% reduction in estimation error across diverse setups, validated through extensive Monte Carlo studies.

Conclusion: Modern learning techniques enhance traditional observer designs, enabling robust and accurate state estimation in uncertain dynamics.

Abstract: This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems. Codes are available at https://github.com/Hao-B-Shu/LTI_LEO.

*Mohammad Areeb Qazi,Maryam Nadeem,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines world models in healthcare, highlighting their role in predictive, multimodal, and action-conditioned representations, but identifies gaps in clinical reliability and outlines a roadmap for further advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current generative AI models for healthcare, such as lack of temporal reasoning and clinical reliability, by exploring the potential of world models.

Method: The paper surveys recent works in three domains: medical imaging and diagnostics, disease progression modeling, and robotic surgery. It introduces a capability rubric to evaluate world model designs.

Result: Findings show that most systems achieve basic temporal and action-conditioned prediction capabilities but largely fail in counterfactual reasoning and planning. Identified limitations include incomplete multimodal data integration and weak interventional validation.

Conclusion: The research concludes with a focus on advancing world models through integration with causal/mechanical frameworks and better trajectory-level uncertainty calibration for safer clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.

TL;DR: Foundation models, including Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN, perform worse than classical machine learning models like XGBoost and CatBoost in corporate bankruptcy prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the efficacy of foundation models in forecasting corporate bankruptcy and compare them against classical machine learning methods.

Method: Systematic comparison conducted using large and imbalanced datasets comprising over one million company records from the Visegrád Group. Models were evaluated for forecasting accuracy and computational demands.

Result: Classical machine learning models outperformed foundation models across all prediction horizons. Foundation models exhibited unreliable probability estimates, and TabPFN demonstrated high computational costs without significant performance advantages.

Conclusion: Current foundation models are less effective than specialized machine learning methods for bankruptcy forecasting tasks, highlighting limitations in generalization for risk-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise across various financial applications, yet their effectiveness for corporate bankruptcy prediction remains systematically unevaluated against established methods. We study bankruptcy forecasting using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN, evaluated on large, highly imbalanced datasets of over one million company records from the Visegrád Group. We provide the first systematic comparison of foundation models against classical machine learning baselines for this task. Our results show that models such as XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperform foundation models across all prediction horizons. LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable probability estimates, undermining their use in risk-sensitive financial settings. TabPFN, while competitive with simpler baselines, requires substantial computational resources with costs not justified by performance gains. These findings suggest that, despite their generality, current foundation models remain less effective than specialized methods for bankruptcy forecasting.

*Yidong Chai,Haoxin Liu,Jiaheng Xie,Chaopeng Wang,Xiao Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ADH-MTL, a method for multi-disease assessment using wearable sensors and deep learning, addressing challenges of double heterogeneity and achieving better performance in analyzing physical diseases alongside depression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is the lack of integrated assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative and effective chronic care management.

Method: The paper proposes a base method and an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method. It includes innovations like group-level modeling, decomposition strategy for reducing complexity, and a Bayesian network to explicitly capture dependencies.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that ADH-MTL surpasses existing baselines and each proposed innovation is effective. The method leverages wearable sensor data for accurate multi-disease assessment.

Conclusion: The study offers innovative computational solutions for combined physical and mental healthcare management, contributing design principles to advance chronic disease care across all phases.

Abstract: Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.

*Seyed Mohamad Moghadas,Bruno Cornelis,Adrian Munteanu*

TL;DR: FreqFlow introduces a lightweight model for efficient multivariate time-series forecasting using frequency-domain transformation and achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and faster computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of computational inefficiency and brittleness in existing generative MTS forecasting models, especially for high-dimensional and complex real-world data patterns.

Method: FreqFlow employs conditional flow matching in the frequency domain, modeling amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer for deterministic forecasting. It incorporates signal decomposition and ODE integration for efficient computation.

Result: FreqFlow achieves 7% RMSE improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to prior methods, while being faster and parameter-efficient with only 89k parameters.

Conclusion: The approach proves to be highly effective for real-world applications, successfully combining lightweight design and high accuracy, suitable for both real-time and long-term MTS forecasting.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is fundamental to applications ranging from urban mobility and resource management to climate modeling. While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods

*Muhammad Aslanimoghanloo,Ahmed ElGazzar,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a generative modeling approach for clinical time series data using latent neural stochastic differential equations to handle irregular sampling, complex physiology, and uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to glean insights from clinical time series data, which is challenging due to irregular sampling, latent complexities in patient physiology, and measurement uncertainties.

Method: The authors propose a generative model utilizing latent neural stochastic differential equations with modality-dependent emission models. The approach incorporates variational inference for state estimation and parameter learning, enabling adaptability to irregular data.

Result: The framework was validated on two tasks: treatment effect estimation in a simulated lung cancer scenario and forecasting physiological signals with ICU patient data. It outperformed ordinary differential equation and LSTM models in both accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates its capability to handle irregularly sampled clinical data while providing more accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions, enhancing its use for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.

*Ali Murtaza Caunhye,Asad Jeewa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares Decision Transformer (DT) with traditional offline RL methods (CQL and IQL) in dense and sparse reward environments. DT performs well in sparse rewards with medium-expert datasets and shows lower variance but requires more computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL aims to develop effective policies from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction, facing challenges in exploration and exploitation in variable reward settings.

Method: The study evaluates DT against traditional offline RL algorithms (CQL, IQL) in the ANT continuous control environment under varied reward densities.

Result: DT showed reduced sensitivity to reward density, performed well in sparse rewards with medium-expert datasets, while IQL excelled in dense rewards with high-quality data, and CQL was balanced across datasets.

Conclusion: Sequence modelling approaches, like DT, are effective in handling uncertain rewards and mixed-quality data, whereas value-based methods are advantageous in dense reward settings with high-quality datasets.

Abstract: The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.

*Muhammad Sa'ood Shah,Asad Jeewa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the limitations of scalarisation functions in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) and explores alternative methods for better decision-making in uncertain environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scalarisation functions often fail to accurately approximate the Pareto front in complex environments, limiting their effectiveness in MORL.

Method: The study examines MORL algorithms using outer-loop multi-policy and inner-loop multi-policy methodologies, specifically evaluating MO Q-Learning with linear and Chebyshev scalarisation functions, as well as Pareto Q-Learning.

Result: Scalarisation functions depend heavily on the environment and Pareto front shape, struggle to find solutions across the solution space, and require complex weight configuration. Inner-loop multi-policy algorithms perform more robustly.

Conclusion: Inner-loop multi-policy algorithms, such as Pareto Q-Learning, offer a more generalized and effective approach for decision-making in dynamic, uncertain environments compared to scalarisation-based methods.

Abstract: Scalarisation functions are widely employed in MORL algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making. However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing effective rewards for autonomous agents in cyber defense is difficult due to the complexity and variability of attack-defense scenarios.

Method: The researchers integrated large language models (LLMs) for constructing reward structures applicable in a deep reinforcement learning simulation environment. Multiple agent personas were created to test heterogeneity.

Result: LLM-guided reward designs enhanced DRL simulations, enabling agents to learn effective defense policies tailored to differing adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: LLM-guided reward systems show promise in creating robust cyber defense strategies, helping autonomous agents adapt to diverse and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.

Motivation: The growing complexity and computational demand of large Transformer-based models limit understanding and practical implementation.

Method: Developed ODE-ViT—an ODE-based Vision Transformer framework—and introduced a teacher-student strategy leveraging intermediate representations from classic ViTs.

Result: On CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 tasks, ODE-ViT achieves competitive performance, interpretable dynamics, and reduces parameters significantly. The teacher-student approach boosts performance by over 10%.

Conclusion: ODE-ViT provides a lightweight, interpretable alternative to existing Vision Transformers, showing promise for efficient and comprehensible model design.

Abstract: In recent years, increasingly large models have achieved outstanding performance across CV tasks. However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two new loss functions to detect label errors by de-weighting or ignoring difficult samples, improving error detection compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label errors in training data impact model performance, and existing methods require robust models to detect such errors.

Method: Two novel loss functions are introduced, inspired by Focal Loss, to de-weight or ignore samples likely to contain label errors.

Result: Using artificially corrupted data, the proposed loss functions demonstrate better F1 scores for detecting label errors compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The new loss functions show promise in improving label error detection, addressing a critical challenge in training robust models.

Abstract: Methods for detecting label errors in training data require models that are robust to label errors (i.e., not fit to erroneously labelled data points). However, acquiring such models often involves training on corrupted data, which presents a challenge. Adjustments to the loss function present an opportunity for improvement. Motivated by Focal Loss (which emphasizes difficult-to-classify samples), two novel, yet simple, loss functions are proposed that de-weight or ignore these difficult samples (i.e., those likely to have label errors). Results on artificially corrupted data show promise, such that F1 scores for detecting errors are improved from the baselines of conventional categorical Cross Entropy and Focal Loss.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation flow-matching models promise universal solutions for inverse problems but currently perform below domain-specific models. Unlocking their potential for broader applicability is essential.

Method: FMPlug integrates a time-dependent warm-start strategy guided by instances and a sharp Gaussianity regularization to enhance problem-specific guidance without compromising foundational structures.

Result: FMPlug demonstrated significant improvements in performance across diverse inverse problems, including image restoration and scientific applications using flow-matching models.

Conclusion: FMPlug presents a promising path to make foundation flow-matching models practical and effective as reusable universal priors for solving inverse problems.

Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for federated learning under dynamic client participation and proposes a solution, KPFL, to improve performance and address challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of dynamic participation in federated learning and provide a systematic benchmarking framework for studying its challenges.

Method: The authors developed an open-source framework for simulating dynamic client participation and proposed KPFL, a plugin using a knowledge pool, dual-age, data-bias weighting, and generative knowledge distillation to improve model robustness.

Result: The study identifies performance degradation in FL models under dynamic participation and shows significant improvements in robustness and generalization with KPFL.

Conclusion: Dynamic participation significantly impacts FL performance, but the proposed KPFL approach effectively mitigates these issues, enhancing robustness and generalization in FL scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed manner, setting it apart from traditional deep learning paradigms. However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fairness in deep learning applications, especially in sensitive fields like medical diagnosis, while avoiding the limitations of resource-intensive and accuracy-reducing bias-mitigation techniques.

Method: The proposed method, FairLRF, leverages SVD to selectively remove bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices, reducing group disparities in DL models. This approach shifts the primary use of SVD from compression to fairness enhancement.

Result: FairLRF outperforms traditional low-rank factorization methods and state-of-the-art fairness enhancement techniques, as validated through extensive experimental results.

Conclusion: This is a novel utilization of SVD for improving fairness in DL models, demonstrating its potential as a practical and efficient bias-mitigation tool.

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.

### [269] [Broad stochastic configuration residual learning system for norm-convergent universal approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16550)
*Han Su,Zhongyan Li,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks due to inappropriate random parameter selection and proposes the improved BSCRLS algorithm to ensure norm convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the sensitivity of the universal approximation property in randomized learning networks like BRLS, which rely on random parameter selection and lack rigorous norm convergence.

Method: The authors propose the BSCRLS algorithm, which incorporates an adaptive supervisory mechanism to constrain random parameter ranges, and establishes the universal approximation theorem based on norm convergence. Three incremental algorithm variants are also introduced.

Result: The BSCRLS algorithms were validated through solar panel dust detection experiments and outperformed 13 other deep and broad learning models.

Conclusion: BSCRLS effectively addresses the limitations of existing randomized learning models by ensuring more robust universal approximation with norm convergence, demonstrating superior performance in practical applications.

Abstract: Universal approximation serves as the foundation of neural network learning algorithms. However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates. Solar panels dust detection experiments are performed on publicly available dataset and compared with 13 deep and broad learning algorithms. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of BSCRLS algorithms.

### [270] [Boosting Predictive Performance on Tabular Data through Data Augmentation with Latent-Space Flow-Based Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16571)
*Md. Tawfique Ihsan,Md. Rakibul Hasan Rafi,Ahmed Shoyeb Raihan,Imtiaz Ahmed,Abdullahil Azeem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling to address problems with existing generative methods in tabular data, achieving efficient and privacy-aware data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tabular learning suffers from severe class imbalance, impacting reliable predictions for rare yet important minority classes. Existing methods struggle with heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy.

Method: The authors propose latent-space tree-driven diffusion methods coupled with gradient-boosted trees for minority oversampling, offering three variants (PCAForest, EmbedForest, and AttentionForest) with different embedding approaches.

Result: Across 11 datasets, AttentionForest provides the highest minority recall and maintains strong precision, calibration, and similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest deliver faster generation and favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable efficient, high-quality tabular data augmentation under class imbalance while addressing privacy concerns and maintaining fidelity through latent-space diffusion.

Abstract: Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves that DP-SGD converges almost surely under smoothness and step size conditions, enhancing theoretical foundations for privacy-preserving optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous theoretical understanding of the almost sure convergence of DP-SGD in machine learning despite its widespread application.

Method: It analyzes DP-SGD, examining convergence under standard decaying step size conditions, and extends the study to momentum variants like DP-SHB and DP-NAG using energy constructs.

Result: The paper establishes almost sure convergence for DP-SGD in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, as well as for its momentum variants.

Conclusion: DP-SGD and its momentum counterparts maintain pathwise stability under privacy distortions, strengthening the framework for differentially private optimization.

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has become the standard algorithm for training machine learning models with rigorous privacy guarantees. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.

TL;DR: This paper explores an artificial palpation method using self-supervised learning, where an encoder-decoder framework learns representations from tactile data to perform tasks like imaging and change detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the potential of automating palpation, a critical aspect of medical examinations usually performed by humans, to improve applications like tactile imaging and change detection.

Method: The authors use an encoder-decoder framework trained on tactile data collected by a robot equipped with tactile sensors. They validate the approach with both a simulation environment and real-world data, including corresponding MRI images as ground truth.

Result: The learned representation captures tactile patterns, surpassing simple mappings of forces, and demonstrates its effectiveness in imaging and detecting changes in palpated objects.

Conclusion: The study shows the feasibility of using self-supervised learning for artificial palpation, with practical applications in medical diagnosis and related fields.

Abstract: Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.

*Shihab Ahmed,El Houcine Bergou,Aritra Dutta,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for improving policy gradient methods by integrating universal reward profiling to enhance convergence speed and performance stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy gradient methods face issues like slow convergence and unreliable reward improvements due to high variance in gradient estimation.

Method: The framework selectively updates the policy using high-confidence performance estimations and is proven to theoretically preserve baseline convergence rates while increasing stability.

Result: Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks show up to 1.5x faster convergence and up to 1.75x reduction in return variance.

Conclusion: The proposed profiling framework enhances reinforcement learning by providing stable, monotonic improvement without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

TL;DR: EGGROLL is an evolution strategies algorithm that uses low-rank matrix perturbations to optimize large neural networks more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability challenges of evolution strategies in optimizing large neural networks with billions of parameters.

Method: EGGROLL introduces low-rank matrix perturbations to reduce memory and computational requirements while maintaining optimization performance.

Result: EGGROLL achieves significant efficiency gains without compromising performance in reinforcement learning, reasoning tasks for large language models, and stable pre-training of integer-based nonlinear recurrent language models.

Conclusion: EGGROLL enables scalable and efficient optimization for large neural networks, confirming its viability as a modern backprop-free methodology.

Abstract: We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.

TL;DR: This paper presents a streamlined control plane design for a dynamic segmented bus in large-scale neuromorphic architectures, optimizing energy, area, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The communication patterns in neuromorphic systems are sparse and asynchronous, requiring efficient interconnect solutions to minimize power consumption and handle bursts of activity.

Method: The authors propose a scenario-aware control plane for a segmented ladder bus, designed to reduce control overhead in the dynamic segmented bus system.

Result: FPGA implementation and software simulation showed reduced area usage for the control plane compared to the data plane while ensuring scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed design methodology successfully balances energy efficiency, area reduction, and scalability for dynamic segmented bus systems in neuromorphic architectures.

Abstract: Large-scale neuromorphic architectures consist of computing tiles that communicate spikes using a shared interconnect. The communication patterns in these systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized, as neural activity is characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of high traffic. These characteristics require optimized interconnects to handle high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Among the proposed interconnect solutions, the dynamic segmented bus has gained attention due to its structural simplicity, scalability, and energy efficiency. Since the benefits of a dynamic segmented bus stem from its simplicity, it is essential to develop a streamlined control plane that can scale efficiently with the network. In this paper, we present a design methodology for a scenario-aware control plane tailored to a segmented ladder bus, with the aim of minimizing control overhead and optimizing energy and area utilization. We evaluated our approach using a combination of FPGA implementation and software simulation to assess scalability. The results demonstrated that our design process effectively reduces the control plane's area footprint compared to the data plane while maintaining scalability with network size.

Motivation: Addressing Radio Frequency Interference detection challenges in radio astronomy while optimizing performance on resource-limited hardware.

Result: Achieved 100mW on-chip inference with state-of-the-art accuracy among SNN baselines, discovering smaller un-partitioned models outperform larger split models.

Conclusion: Hardware and neural network co-design lead to better performance and provide insights for advancing neuromorphic computing in demanding fields like radio astronomy.

Abstract: Imminent radio telescope observatories provide massive data rates making deep learning based processing appealing while simultaneously demanding real-time performance at low-energy; prohibiting the use of many artificial neural network based approaches. We begin tackling the scientifically existential challenge of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection by deploying deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware. Our approach partitions large, pre-trained networks onto SynSense Xylo hardware using maximal splitting, a novel greedy algorithm. We validate this pipeline with on-chip power measurements, achieving instrument-scaled inference at 100mW. While our full-scale SNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among SNN baselines, our experiments reveal a more important insight that a smaller un-partitioned model significantly outperforms larger, split models. This finding highlights that hardware co-design is paramount for optimal performance. Our work thus provides a practical deployment blueprint, a key insight into the challenges of model scaling, and reinforces radio astronomy as a demanding yet ideal domain for advancing applied neuromorphic computing.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM4EO, a framework utilizing Large Language Models to enhance evolutionary algorithms through dynamic and adaptive operator-level meta-evolution, resulting in improved efficiency and performance in optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evolutionary Algorithms suffer from transient and degradation in search performance due to static operators, prompting the need for dynamic operator designs that ensure adaptive optimization throughout the process.

Method: The proposed LLM4EO framework includes knowledge-transfer-based operator initialization, evolution perception and analysis for operator improvement, and adaptive dynamic optimization of operators using LLMs.

Result: LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and significantly outperforms traditional evolutionary algorithms and programming approaches across benchmark datasets for flexible job shop scheduling.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel paradigm where operators and populations co-evolve using LLM-based insights, enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of evolutionary optimization processes.

Abstract: Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search performance is transient during iterations and prone to degradation. Dynamic operators aim to address this but typically rely on predefined designs and localized parameter control during the search process, lacking adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for Evolutionary Optimization (LLM4EO), comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, initialization of operators is performed by transferring the strengths of classical operators via LLMs. Then, search preferences and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance and evolutionary features, accompanied by corresponding suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, gene selection priorities of operators are dynamically optimized via improvement prompting strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of populations and operators in the search, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, a series of validations on multiple benchmark datasets of the flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms both mainstream evolutionary programming and traditional EAs.

*Bohdan Liesnikov,David Binder,Tim Süberkrüb*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper presents an algorithmic type system and unification algorithm for implicit arguments in Polarity, enabling symmetry between inductive and coinductive types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the expression problem in dependently typed languages, which lack adequate support for coinductive types compared to inductive types.

Method: The authors propose a complete type system and unification algorithm for Polarity, including rules for reduction semantics, conversion checking, and pattern-matching.

Result: The work offers an implementation of the proposed algorithms, described comprehensively, serving as a blueprint for dependently typed languages.

Conclusion: The study advances type inference for implicit arguments in dependently typed languages while maintaining symmetry between inductive and coinductive types.

Abstract: The expression problem describes a fundamental tradeoff between two types of extensibility: extending a type with new operations, such as by pattern matching on an algebraic data type in functional programming, and extending a type with new constructors, such as by adding a new object implementing an interface in object-oriented programming. Most dependently typed languages have good support for the former style through inductive types, but support for the latter style through coinductive types is usually much poorer. Polarity is a language that treats both kinds of types symmetrically and allows the developer to switch between type representations.However, it currently lacks several features expected of a state-of-the-art dependently typed language, such as implicit arguments. The central aim of this paper is to provide an algorithmic type system and inference algorithm for implicit arguments that respect the core symmetry of the language. Our work provides two key contributions: a complete algorithmic description of the type system backing Polarity, and a comprehensive description of a unification algorithm that covers arbitrary inductive and coinductive types. We give rules for reduction semantics, conversion checking, and a unification algorithm for pattern-matching, which are essential for a usable implementation. A work-in-progress implementation of the algorithms in this paper is available at https://polarity-lang.github.io/. We expect that the comprehensive account of the unification algorithm and our design decisions can serve as a blueprint for other dependently typed languages that support inductive and coinductive types symmetrically.

TL;DR: Chorex is a programming language that enhances choreographic programming in Elixir, enabling robust distributed applications by tolerating actor failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust system for distributed applications, addressing actor failures and ensuring tight integration with host language.

Method: Chorex uses checkpoint-based recovery mechanisms, metaprogramming for choreographies, and statically checks mismatches between choreography requirements and actor implementations.

Result: Chorex is demonstrated via examples, showcasing implementation details, secure protocol modeling, and checkpointing performance evaluation.

Conclusion: Chorex's approach is viable for integrating restartable actors and choreographic programming into other languages, promoting distributed application robustness.

Abstract: We built Chorex, a language that brings choreographic programming to Elixir as a path toward robust distributed applications. Chorex is unique among choreographic languages because it tolerates failure among actors: when an actor crashes, Chorex spawns a new process, restores state using a checkpoint, and updates the network configuration for all actors. Chorex also proves that full-featured choreographies can be implemented via metaprogramming, and that doing so achieves tight integration with the host language. For example, mismatches between choreography requirements and an actor implementation are reported statically and in terms of source code rather than macro-expanded code. This paper illustrates Chorex on several examples, ranging from a higher-order bookseller to a secure remote password protocol, details its implementation, and measures the overhead of checkpointing. We conjecture that Chorex's projection strategy, which outputs sets of stateless functions, is a viable approach for other languages to support restartable actors.

TL;DR: Microcontroller VMs often struggle with responsiveness and features due to limited memory. This paper proposes a disaggregated VM model that offloads components to a host machine, implemented through BlueScript VM. Using the host's powerful capabilities, the VM improves speed, interactivity, and supports rich features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microcontroller VMs are constrained by limited memory, hindering interactivity and speed. The authors aim to leverage host machines' computational power to enhance functionality and overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors propose a disaggregated VM model, exemplified through BlueScript VM, which moves components to a host machine. A shadow machine mirrors the microcontroller's state on the host to minimize communication overhead.

Result: Experiments reveal that the offloaded incremental compiler improves execution speed compared to MicroPython and Espruino while maintaining interactivity. The offloaded dynamic compiler also boosts VM performance.

Conclusion: Offloading components to host machines demonstrates the feasibility of enhancing microcontroller VMs with rich features and better performance, even under memory constraints.

Abstract: Virtual machines (VMs) are highly beneficial for microcontroller development. 
In particular, interactive programming environments greatly facilitate iterative development processes, 
and higher execution speeds expand the range of applications that can be developed. 
However, due to their limited memory size, microcontroller VMs provide a limited set of features. 
Widely used VMs for microcontrollers often lack interactive responsiveness and/or high execution speed. 
While researchers have investigated offloading certain VM components to other machines,the types of components that can be offloaded are still restricted. 
In this paper, we propose a disaggregated VM that offloads as many components as possible to a host machine. 
This makes it possible to exploit the abundant memory of the host machine and its powerful processing capability to provide rich features through the VM. 
As an instance of a disaggregated VM, we design and implement a BlueScript VM. 
The BlueScript VM is a virtual machine for microcontrollers that provides an interactive development environment. 
We offload most of the components of the BlueScript VM to a host machine. 
To reduce communication overhead between the host machine and the microcontroller,  
we employed a data structure called a shadow machine on the host machine, 
which mirrors the execution state of the microcontroller. 
Through our experiments, we confirmed that offloading components does not seriously compromise their expected benefits.  
We assess that an offloaded incremental compiler results in faster execution speed than MicroPython and Espruino,  
while keeping interactivity comparable with MicroPython.  
In addition, our experiments observe that the offloaded dynamic compiler improves VM performance. 
Through this investigation, we demonstrate the feasibility of providing rich features even on VMs for memory-limited microcontrollers.

TL;DR: Operon introduces a Rust-based workflow engine tailored for ragged data by managing variable-length elements using named dimensions and dependency relations. It enhances parallelism and reduces overhead in data generation pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings in existing workflow engines regarding handling ragged data, which arises frequently in diverse domains like NLP and AI, requiring manual tracking and indexing.

Method: This research introduces Operon, leveraging named dimensions and explicit dependency relations, combining a domain-specific language for statically verifying pipelines with a runtime system for dynamic scheduling of tasks.

Result: Operon demonstrates impressive results, reducing baseline overhead by 14.94x, maintaining linear output rates, and surpassing existing engines in scalability and efficiency, specially for machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: Operon offers a robust solution to managing ragged data efficiently, proving its deterministic execution and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale data workflows.

Abstract: Modern data processing workflows frequently encounter ragged data: collections with variable-length elements that arise naturally in domains like natural language processing, scientific measurements, and autonomous AI agents. Existing workflow engines lack native support for tracking the shapes and dependencies inherent to ragged data, forcing users to manage complex indexing and dependency bookkeeping manually. We present Operon, a Rust-based workflow engine that addresses these challenges through a novel formalism of named dimensions with explicit dependency relations. Operon provides a domain-specific language where users declare pipelines with dimension annotations that are statically verified for correctness, while the runtime system dynamically schedules tasks as data shapes are incrementally discovered during execution. We formalize the mathematical foundation for reasoning about partial shapes and prove that Operon's incremental construction algorithm guarantees deterministic and confluent execution in parallel settings. The system's explicit modeling of partially-known states enables robust persistence and recovery mechanisms, while its per-task multi-queue architecture achieves efficient parallelism across heterogeneous task types. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Operon outperforms an existing workflow engine with 14.94x baseline overhead reduction while maintaining near-linear end-to-end output rates as workloads scale, making it particularly suitable for large-scale data generation pipelines in machine learning applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular gimballed rotor mechanism for omnidirectional quadrotors, achieving full actuation with lightweight design and validated by control modifications and flight tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quadrotors are limited by underactuation, and existing omnidirectional designs require heavy structural changes. This paper aims to propose a lightweight, modular solution.

Method: The authors designed a gimballed rotor system with servo motors to independently tilt each rotor and developed a new control allocation within the PX4 Autopilot.

Result: The gimballed rotor mechanism was successfully implemented and validated through flight tests, demonstrating its functionality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism provides a structurally efficient and fully actuated solution for omnidirectional quadrotors without requiring significant changes to the quadrotor's central structure.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a gimballed rotor mechanism as a modular and efficient solution for constructing omnidirectional quadrotors. Unlike conventional quadrotors, which are underactuated, this class of quadrotors achieves full actuation, enabling independent motion in all six degrees of freedom. While existing omnidirectional quadrotor designs often require significant structural modifications, the proposed gimballed rotor system maintains a lightweight and easy-to-integrate design by incorporating servo motors within the rotor platforms, allowing independent tilting of each rotor without major alterations to the central structure of a quadrotor. To accommodate this unconventional design, we develop a new control allocation scheme in PX4 Autopilot and present successful flight tests, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Debasmita Ghose,Oz Gitelson,Ryan Jin,Grace Abawe,Marynel Vazquez,Brian Scassellati*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for detecting and adapting to human goal changes in human-robot collaboration using action tracking, policy verification, and Receding Horizon Planning to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human goals often shift mid-task in real-world scenarios, making it difficult for robots to adapt and collaborate without explicit communication.

Method: The proposed method tracks multiple candidate action sequences, uses a policy bank for goal change detection, refines past action beliefs, constructs Receding Horizon Planning trees, and incorporates Differentiating Actions to detect new human goals.

Result: Evaluation in a collaborative cooking environment demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline algorithms, with faster goal convergence, reduced task completion times, and enhanced collaboration efficiency.

Conclusion: The method significantly enhances the adaptability and collaborative effectiveness of robots in dynamic human-robot interactions, proving its utility in real-world applications with variable goals.

Abstract: For effective human-robot collaboration, a robot must align its actions with human goals, even as they change mid-task. Prior approaches often assume fixed goals, reducing goal prediction to a one-time inference. However, in real-world scenarios, humans frequently shift goals, making it challenging for robots to adapt without explicit communication. We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal. We evaluate our approach in a collaborative cooking environment with up to 30 unique recipes and compare it to three comparable human goal prediction algorithms. Our method outperforms all baselines, quickly converging to the correct goal after a switch, reducing task completion time, and improving collaboration efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper explores how different robotic sounds impact human interaction, emphasizing their potential to improve collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how auditory channels, including operational and intentional sounds, affect human-robot interaction and collaboration.

Method: The study focused on tasks involving spatial sound localization and handover, using the Kinova Gen3 manipulator, with evaluations of human perception and behavior.

Result: Consequential robotic sounds did not negatively impact human perception, lateral spatial localization was accurate, frontal cues were less effective, and spatial sounds reduced discomfort and promoted warmth while conveying task-relevant information.

Conclusion: Functional auditory design can enhance human-robot collaboration and inform better interaction strategies in future robotics systems.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into everyday environments, understanding how they communicate with humans is critical. Sound offers a powerful channel for interaction, encompassing both operational noises and intentionally designed auditory cues. In this study, we examined the effects of consequential and functional sounds on human perception and behavior, including a novel exploration of spatial sound through localization and handover tasks. Results show that consequential sounds of the Kinova Gen3 manipulator did not negatively affect perceptions, spatial localization is highly accurate for lateral cues but declines for frontal cues, and spatial sounds can simultaneously convey task-relevant information while promoting warmth and reducing discomfort. These findings highlight the potential of functional and transformative auditory design to enhance human-robot collaboration and inform future sound-based interaction strategies.

*Zili Tang,Ying Zhang,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for multi-robot collaborative object pushing in complex environments, addressing challenges like task coordination and hybrid transitions between pushing modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often lack manipulators, and objects may not be suitable for grasping, necessitating effective non-prehensile skills like pushing. The goal is enabling robots to push arbitrary objects collaboratively in cluttered environments.

Method: A combinatorial hybrid optimization approach is used, involving task decomposition, keyframe-guided search, and hybrid control execution. A diffusion-based accelerator predicts keyframes and prioritized pushing modes.

Result: The method is validated through simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating its efficiency across diverse robots, objects, and scenarios, including heterogeneous teams and planar/6D pushing.

Conclusion: This framework successfully facilitates efficient and scalable multi-robot pushing in dynamic environments, addressing challenges in task coordination and pushing skill execution.

Abstract: Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general-shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Semantic Glitch," a soft flying robotic art installation with an intentionally low-fidelity design and navigation system driven by a multimodal large language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional focus on high precision and flawless performance in robotics and explore creative possibilities behind artistic expression through imperfections.

Method: Developed an autonomous flying robot that relies on semantic understanding from a multimodal large language model, while rejecting traditional precise sensors like LiDAR and SLAM. The robot's personality is authored via natural language prompts.

Result: The study demonstrated robust, quantifiably distinct personas and autonomous navigation behaviors, such as landmark-based navigation and a gap between planning and execution that leads to unpredictable yet plausible actions.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a novel approach for designing robotic companions valued for their character and emergent behaviors over efficiency, promoting a creative alternative to mainstream practices.

Abstract: While mainstream robotics pursues metric precision and flawless performance, this paper explores the creative potential of a deliberately "lo-fi" approach. We present the "Semantic Glitch," a soft flying robotic art installation whose physical form, a 3D pixel style cloud, is a "physical glitch" derived from digital archaeology. We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a "narrative mind" that complements the "weak," historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas. The combined analysis reveals emergent behaviors, from landmark-based navigation to a compelling "plan to execution" gap, and a character whose unpredictable, plausible behavior stems from a lack of precise proprioception. This demonstrates a lo-fi framework for creating imperfect companions whose success is measured in character over efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater robotic manipulation is hindered by lighting variations, color distortion, and reduced visibility, requiring robust solutions.

Method: Bi-AQUA consists of a three-level lighting adaptation structure, including lighting representation extraction, FiLM modulation for adaptive feature extraction, and a lighting token for task-aware conditioning.

Result: Experiments prove Bi-AQUA excels in underwater pick-and-place tasks under varying lighting conditions, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Bi-AQUA bridges terrestrial imitation learning with underwater manipulation, enabling robust robotic operations in adverse lighting environments.

Abstract: Underwater robotic manipulation is fundamentally challenged by extreme lighting variations, color distortion, and reduced visibility. We introduce Bi-AQUA, the first underwater bilateral control-based imitation learning framework that integrates lighting-aware visual processing for underwater robot arms. Bi-AQUA employs a hierarchical three-level lighting adaptation mechanism: a Lighting Encoder that extracts lighting representations from RGB images without manual annotation and is implicitly supervised by the imitation objective, FiLM modulation of visual backbone features for adaptive, lighting-aware feature extraction, and an explicit lighting token added to the transformer encoder input for task-aware conditioning. Experiments on a real-world underwater pick-and-place task under diverse static and dynamic lighting conditions show that Bi-AQUA achieves robust performance and substantially outperforms a bilateral baseline without lighting modeling. Ablation studies further confirm that all three lighting-aware components are critical. This work bridges terrestrial bilateral control-based imitation learning and underwater manipulation, enabling force-sensitive autonomous operation in challenging marine environments.

Result: MagBotSim enables advanced algorithm development and simulation for magnetic robotics, demonstrating its applicability in achieving higher manufacturing efficiency.

Conclusion: MagBotSim serves as a foundation for innovative magnetic robotics systems, revolutionizing the manufacturing industry towards compact, adaptable, and efficient solutions.

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is about to revolutionize in-machine material flow in industrial automation. Such systems are flexibly configurable and can include a large number of independently actuated shuttles (movers) that dynamically rebalance production capacity. Beyond their capabilities for dynamic transportation, these systems possess the inherent yet unexploited potential to perform manipulation. By merging the fields of transportation and manipulation into a coordinated swarm of magnetic robots (MagBots), we enable manufacturing systems to achieve significantly higher efficiency, adaptability, and compactness. To support the development of intelligent algorithms for magnetic levitation systems, we introduce MagBotSim (Magnetic Robotics Simulation): a physics-based simulation for magnetic levitation systems. By framing magnetic levitation systems as robot swarms and providing a dedicated simulation, this work lays the foundation for next generation manufacturing systems powered by Magnetic Robotics.

*Kewei Chen,Yayu Long,Mingsheng Shang*

TL;DR: The paper introduces PIPHEN, a framework addressing data bottlenecks in multi-robot systems by replacing raw data communication with semantic communication, achieving higher efficiency and decision-making speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot systems suffer bandwidth bottlenecks and decision delays due to high-dimensional multimedia data transmission.

Method: The framework utilizes semantic distillation through PIPN for data compression and HEN for efficient control based on energy conservation.

Result: PIPHEN compresses data to less than 5% of its original size, reduces latency from 315ms to 76ms, and improves task success rates significantly.

Conclusion: PIPHEN provides an efficient solution to the shared brain dilemma in multi-robot systems by improving communication and decision-making efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems in complex physical collaborations face a "shared brain dilemma": transmitting high-dimensional multimedia data (e.g., video streams at ~30MB/s) creates severe bandwidth bottlenecks and decision-making latency. To address this, we propose PIPHEN, an innovative distributed physical cognition-control framework. Its core idea is to replace "raw data communication" with "semantic communication" by performing "semantic distillation" at the robot edge, reconstructing high-dimensional perceptual data into compact, structured physical representations. This idea is primarily realized through two key components: (1) a novel Physical Interaction Prediction Network (PIPN), derived from large model knowledge distillation, to generate this representation; and (2) a Hamiltonian Energy Network (HEN) controller, based on energy conservation, to precisely translate this representation into coordinated actions. Experiments show that, compared to baseline methods, PIPHEN can compress the information representation to less than 5% of the original data volume and reduce collaborative decision-making latency from 315ms to 76ms, while significantly improving task success rates. This work provides a fundamentally efficient paradigm for resolving the "shared brain dilemma" in resource-constrained multi-robot systems.

*Vincenzo Pomponi,Paolo Franceschi,Stefano Baraldo,Loris Roveda,Oliver Avram,Luca Maria Gambardella,Anna Valente*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DynaMimicGen (D-MG) is a scalable framework for generating diverse datasets to train manipulation policies with minimal human input, supporting dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generation techniques for manipulation policies are time-consuming and inflexible for dynamic environments. D-MG aims to address these limitations.

Method: Using limited human demonstrations, D-MG segments tasks into subtasks and uses Dynamic Movement Primitives to adapt and generalize actions in dynamic scenarios, producing realistic trajectories.

Result: Agents trained on D-MG-generated datasets showed strong performance on tasks with unpredictable environment changes, handling static and dynamic manipulation challenges effectively.

Conclusion: D-MG minimizes human intervention while enabling scalable, autonomous robot learning in dynamic environments, presenting an efficient alternative to manual data collection.

Abstract: Learning robust manipulation policies typically requires large and diverse datasets, the collection of which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often impractical for dynamic environments. In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.

*Kewei Chen,Yayu Long,Shuai Li,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces FT-NCFM, a generative data distillation framework to mitigate dataset dependency in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, achieving significant efficiency and performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the data-centric challenges in Vision-Language-Action models that depend on extensive, redundant, and uneven datasets, which restrict their generalization and wide adoption.

Method: The method involves FT-NCFM, a framework combining causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess data value, and an adversarial process to create reusable, information-dense datasets.

Result: Models trained on a distilled coreset (5% of the original dataset) achieve 85-90% success rates compared to the complete dataset, reducing training time by over 80%.

Conclusion: Intelligent data distillation, exemplified by FT-NCFM, is a promising avenue for developing efficient and high-performing Vision-Language-Action models.

Abstract: The powerful generalization of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is bottlenecked by their heavy reliance on massive, redundant, and unevenly valued datasets, hindering their widespread application. Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%. Our work demonstrates that intelligent data distillation is a highly promising new path for building efficient, high-performance VLA models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a biologically-inspired robotic vision technique called synthetic aperture (SA) sensing via peering motions, which enhances scene understanding despite occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation in robotic vision caused by partial occlusions in cluttered environments, drawing inspiration from animals' natural peering behavior.

Method: A robot executes a peering motion to create a wide synthetic aperture, allowing computational synthesis of shallow depth-of-field images that blur occluders and clarify the background.

Result: Demonstrated that SA sensing restores scene understanding, enhances large multimodal models' visual reasoning, and offers an occlusion-robust, computationally efficient, deployable alternative to LiDAR and feature-dependent 3D vision.

Conclusion: The study bridges animal-inspired behavior and robotics, positioning peering motions as a powerful tool for improving scene understanding in occlusion-heavy environments.

Abstract: Peering, a side-to-side motion used by animals to estimate distance through motion parallax, offers a powerful bio-inspired strategy to overcome a fundamental limitation in robotic vision: partial occlusion. Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot. This research bridges animal behavior and robotics, suggesting that peering motions for synthetic aperture sensing are a key to advanced scene understanding in complex, cluttered environments.

TL;DR: Funabot-Upper is a novel wearable haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perception for 14 upper-body motions with improved accuracy and reduced perceptual mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wearable haptic devices are limited to single body parts or exhibit perceptual mixing when applied to multiple parts. This paper aims to address these limitations and enhance kinesthetic perception across multiple upper-body joints.

Method: The design leverages artificial muscle contraction technology to deform clothing in 3D, enabling stimulation of joints and muscles independently based on a simplified design policy.

Result: Experimental results show that the new design reduces perceptual mixing and increases recognition accuracy from 68.8% to 94.6% compared to the previous Funabot-Suit.

Conclusion: Funabot-Upper effectively improves the recognition of kinesthetic perceptions across multiple upper-body joints and shows promise for advanced haptic applications.

Abstract: This paper presents Funabot-Upper, a wearable haptic suit that enables users to perceive 14 upper-body motions, including those of the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Inducing kinesthetic perception through wearable haptic devices has attracted attention, and various devices have been developed in the past. However, these have been limited to verifications on single body parts, and few have applied the same method to multiple body parts as well. In our previous study, we developed a technology that uses the contraction of artificial muscles to deform clothing in three dimensions. Using this technology, we developed a haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perception of 7 motions in multiple upper body. However, perceptual mixing caused by stimulating multiple human muscles has occurred between the shoulder and the elbow. In this paper, we established a new, simplified design policy and developed a novel haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perceptions in the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist by stimulating joints and muscles independently. We experimentally demonstrated the induced kinesthetic perception and examined the relationship between stimulation and perceived kinesthetic perception under the new design policy. Experiments confirmed that Funabot-Upper successfully induces kinesthetic perception across multiple joints while reducing perceptual mixing observed in previous designs. The new suit improved recognition accuracy from 68.8% to 94.6% compared to the previous Funabot-Suit, demonstrating its superiority and potential for future haptic applications.

TL;DR: Humanoid robots demand accurate state estimation for effective bipedal locomotion. This paper introduces InEKFormer, combining Kalman filters and Transformer networks for improved state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots face challenges in achieving stable locomotion across various applications due to difficulties in state estimation.

Method: A hybrid approach using an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) with a Transformer network. Results are compared with existing methods using data from the RH5 humanoid robot.

Result: The proposed method shows the potential of Transformers in state estimation but underscores the need for robust autoregressive training in complex environments.

Conclusion: Transformers enhance state estimation capabilities but require refinements in training processes for application in high-dimensional contexts.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have great potential for a wide range of applications, including industrial and domestic use, healthcare, and search and rescue missions. However, bipedal locomotion in different environments is still a challenge when it comes to performing stable and dynamic movements. This is where state estimation plays a crucial role, providing fast and accurate feedback of the robot's floating base state to the motion controller. Although classical state estimation methods such as Kalman filters are widely used in robotics, they require expert knowledge to fine-tune the noise parameters. Due to recent advances in the field of machine learning, deep learning methods are increasingly used for state estimation tasks. In this work, we propose the InEKFormer, a novel hybrid state estimation method that incorporates an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and a Transformer network. We compare our method with the InEKF and the KalmanNet approaches on datasets obtained from the humanoid robot RH5. The results indicate the potential of Transformers in humanoid state estimation, but also highlight the need for robust autoregressive training in these high-dimensional problems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel RL framework for learning stable and feasible motion and control policies in robots, ensuring stability and actuator feasibility by construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and unsafe exploration risks in model-free reinforcement learning for robots combining DMPs and VIC.

Method: C-GMS reframes policy exploration as sampling from a manifold of stable gain schedules, guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and feasibility by design.

Result: Simulation and real robot experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of C-GMS in ensuring stable, reliable performance and bounded tracking error.

Conclusion: C-GMS paves the way for safe and reliable autonomous robot interactions in complex environments while addressing limitations of traditional model-free RL approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful approach for robots to learn complex, collaborative skills by combining Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) for motion and Variable Impedance Control (VIC) for compliant interaction. However, this model-free paradigm often risks instability and unsafe exploration due to the time-varying nature of impedance gains. This work introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel trajectory-centric RL framework that learns combined DMP and VIC policies while guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and actuator feasibility by construction. Our approach reframes policy exploration as sampling from a mathematically defined manifold of stable gain schedules. This ensures every policy rollout is guaranteed to be stable and physically realizable, thereby eliminating the need for reward penalties or post-hoc validation. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our approach ensures bounded tracking error even in the presence of bounded model errors and deployment-time uncertainties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of C-GMS in simulation and verify its efficacy on a real robot, paving the way for reliable autonomous interaction in complex environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based solution for navigating dynamic environments without explicit object detection or motion prediction. It directly converts LiDAR data into actions and ensures safe maneuvers for quadrotors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of traditional methods in navigating highly dynamic and occluded environments by avoiding reliance on explicit obstacle detection, tracking, and prediction.

Method: A novel RL framework utilizes single LiDAR sensing to derive environmental dynamics. It combines a depth sensing distance map and a motion feature map from point cloud data into a lightweight representation. Policy optimization is guided by a relative motion modulated distance field, focusing on dynamic obstacle avoidance.

Result: The system demonstrates high success rates, adaptability, and effective deployment in simulations and real-world scenarios. It enables safe and autonomous quadrotor navigation in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: This RL-based method provides a robust and efficient solution for dynamic environment navigation, eliminating the complexities of traditional object-focused detection approaches while ensuring safe maneuverability.

Abstract: Challenges in traversing dynamic clutters lie mainly in the efficient perception of the environmental dynamics and the generation of evasive behaviors considering obstacle movement. Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers.

Motivation: Robots lack self-reflection capabilities, essential for intelligent behavior, learning, and decision making.

Method: A metacognition architecture inspired by neuroscience is proposed, using confidence evaluations within decision-making schemes.

Result: Confidence-guided robots demonstrate improved reliability and robustness in physical deployments, particularly during tasks involving autonomous tool invention.

Conclusion: Embodied action monitoring integrated with confidence-based evaluations enhances robot decision-making and outlines future potential research directions in metacognitive robotics.

Abstract: Robots today often miss a key ingredient of truly intelligent behavior: the ability to reflect on their own cognitive processes and decisions. In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme. Confidence-informed robots can evaluate the reliability of their decisions, improving their robustness during real-world physical deployment. This form of robotic metacognition emphasizes embodied action monitoring as a means to achieve better informed decisions. We also highlight potential applications and research directions for robot metacognition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robotic manipulators face challenges like nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and base-manipulator coupling, motivating the need for advanced control strategies.

Method: The hPID controller uses a homogeneous control theory framework for stability and tracking error improvement, featuring state-dependent, nonlinear PID gains and Lyapunov-based stability analysis.

Result: Experimental validation shows the hPID controller ensures precise trajectory tracking, faster response, and robustness against uncertainties, outperforming traditional PID methods.

Conclusion: The hPID control strategy offers a scalable solution for enhancing autonomy and reliability in mobile robotic manipulation systems for various environments.

Abstract: Mobile robotic manipulators (MRMs), which integrate mobility and manipulation capabilities, present significant control challenges due to their nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and coupling between the base and manipulator subsystems. This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties. This research contributes a scalable and analytically grounded control framework for enhancing the autonomy and reliability of next-generation mobile manipulation systems in structured and unstructured environments.

### [300] [LAOF: Robust Latent Action Learning with Optical Flow Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16407)
*Xizhou Bu,Jiexi Lyu,Fulei Sun,Ruichen Yang,Zhiqiang Ma,Wei Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces LAOF, a framework utilizing optical flow to learn latent action representations from videos, addressing distractors and achieving superior results in imitation and reinforcement learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning latent actions from videos is essential for scalable embodied models, but current methods struggle with distractions and scarcity of action labels.

Method: LAOF leverages the agent's optical flow as an action-driven signal, applying pseudo-supervised learning to stabilize training and enhance representation quality.

Result: LAOF achieves robust latent representations, surpassing existing methods in label-scarce conditions and competing even without action supervision.

Conclusion: LAOF demonstrates optical flow's potential as an effective substitute for action labels, improving learning efficiencies in embodied foundation models.

Abstract: Learning latent actions from large-scale videos is crucial for the pre-training of scalable embodied foundation models, yet existing methods often struggle with action-irrelevant distractors. Although incorporating action supervision can alleviate these distractions, its effectiveness is restricted by the scarcity of available action labels. Optical flow represents pixel-level motion between consecutive frames, naturally suppressing background elements and emphasizing moving objects. Motivated by this, we propose robust Latent Action learning with Optical Flow constraints, called LAOF, a pseudo-supervised framework that leverages the agent's optical flow as an action-driven signal to learn latent action representations robust to distractors. Experimental results show that the latent representations learned by LAOF outperform existing methods on downstream imitation learning and reinforcement learning tasks. This superior performance arises from optical flow constraints, which substantially stabilize training and improve the quality of latent representations under extremely label-scarce conditions, while remaining effective as the proportion of action labels increases to 10 percent. Importantly, even without action supervision, LAOF matches or surpasses action-supervised methods trained with 1 percent of action labels.

*Chenming Wu,Xiaofan Li,Chengkai Dai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEG, a framework that optimizes 3D models for minimal support structure usage during printing, reducing waste, time, and improving printability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D printing approaches use support structures to handle overhanging features, but these are addressed only in post-processing. The paper aims to integrate support-efficient design directly into the model generation phase.

Method: The framework SEG integrates Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset (ODPO) to generate 3D geometries that inherently require fewer support structures by simulation during training.

Result: SEG outperforms baseline approaches (e.g., TRELLIS, DPO, DRO) in reducing support volume and maintaining high fidelity to input prompts, validated using benchmark datasets like Thingi10k-Val and GPT-3DP-Val.

Conclusion: SEG offers a sustainable and efficient approach to 3D printing by directly optimizing models in the generative phase, reducing material waste and paving the way for improved fabrication practices.

Abstract: The transition from digital 3D models to physical objects via 3D printing often requires support structures to prevent overhanging features from collapsing during the fabrication process. While current slicing technologies offer advanced support strategies, they focus on post-processing optimizations rather than addressing the underlying need for support-efficient design during the model generation phase. This paper introduces SEG (\textit{\underline{S}upport-\underline{E}ffective \underline{G}eneration}), a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset (ODPO) into the 3D generation pipeline to directly optimize models for minimal support material usage. By incorporating support structure simulation into the training process, SEG encourages the generation of geometries that inherently require fewer supports, thus reducing material waste and production time. We demonstrate SEG's effectiveness through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Thingi10k-Val and GPT-3DP-Val, showing that SEG significantly outperforms baseline models such as TRELLIS, DPO, and DRO in terms of support volume reduction and printability. Qualitative results further reveal that SEG maintains high fidelity to input prompts while minimizing the need for support structures. Our findings highlight the potential of SEG to transform 3D printing by directly optimizing models during the generative process, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient digital fabrication practices.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that synthetic data alone can match the performance of real-world pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, showing strong sim-to-real generalization across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential of synthetic data in enabling large-scale and effective pre-training for Vision-Language-Action models, as prior works did not establish comparable capabilities of synthetic data.

Method: This paper uses a synthetic dataset, InternData-A1, generated through an autonomous, compositional simulation pipeline that accommodates diverse tasks, skills, embodiments, and long-horizon compositions.

Result: The synthetic dataset effectively matches the strongest real-robot pre-training dataset ($π_0$) in simulation and real-world tasks, and surprisingly exhibits strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The study highlights the substantial value of synthetic data for VLA model pre-training, releasing both the dataset and an open-source pipeline to advance embodied AI research accessibility.

Abstract: Recent works explore how real and synthetic data contribute to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models' generalization. While current VLA models have shown the strong effectiveness of large-scale real-robot pre-training, synthetic data has not previously demonstrated comparable capability at scale. This paper provides the first evidence that synthetic data alone can match the performance of the strongest $π$-dataset in pre-training a VLA model, revealing the substantial value of large-scale simulation. The resulting model also exhibits surprisingly zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on several challenging tasks. Our synthetic dataset, InternData-A1, contains over 630k trajectories and 7,433 hours across 4 embodiments, 18 skills, 70 tasks, and 227 scenes, covering rigid, articulated, deformable, and fluid-object manipulation. It is generated through a highly autonomous, fully decoupled, and compositional simulation pipeline that enables long-horizon skill composition, flexible task assembly, and heterogeneous embodiments with minimal manual tuning. Using the same architecture as $π_0$, we pre-train a model entirely on InternData-A1 and find that it matches the official $π_0$ across 49 simulation tasks, 5 real-world tasks, and 4 long-horizon dexterous tasks. We release the dataset and will open-source the generation pipeline to broaden access to large-scale robotic data and to lower the barrier to scalable data creation for embodied AI research.

TL;DR: The paper presents AINA, a framework for learning robot manipulation policies from in-the-wild human videos using Aria Gen 2 glasses, enabling multi-fingered manipulation without robot-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance generalizable robot manipulation in human environments by overcoming challenges such as the embodiment gap and the difficulty of extracting motion and contextual cues from human videos.

Method: The proposed framework, AINA, utilizes data captured by Aria Gen 2 glasses, which provide RGB video, head and hand poses, and stereo depth estimation, to enable learning of 3D point-based multi-fingered manipulation policies robust to background changes.

Result: The framework demonstrated success across nine everyday manipulation tasks, showing promise over prior approaches through comparisons and design choice evaluations.

Conclusion: AINA represents a significant step toward generalizable robot manipulation by leveraging simple, portable human data collection tools, bypassing the need for robot-specific data or simulation-based corrections.

Abstract: Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RGym, a cost-efficient framework to assess automated program repair in Linux kernel debugging using GPT-5 Thinking, achieving up to a 43.36% success rate on a verified dataset of 143 bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated program repair benchmarks mostly address userspace applications, ignoring kernel-space complexities such as concurrency and hardware interactions, which necessitate a lightweight and cost-effective evaluation framework.

Method: The authors developed RGym, a local evaluation framework, and proposed an APR pipeline leveraging call stacks, blamed commits, and feedback-based retries for debugging Linux kernel bugs.

Result: The proposed approach achieved a success rate of up to 43.36% on a dataset of 143 bugs with a cost-efficient setup under $0.20 per bug.

Conclusion: RGym and its specialized localization techniques offer a promising solution for kernel-space APR, demonstrating improved pass rates, cost-efficiency, and the viability of local hardware for debugging intricate code structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated program repair (APR) but current benchmarks like SWE-Bench predominantly focus on userspace applications and overlook the complexities of kernel-space debugging and repair. The Linux kernel poses unique challenges due to its monolithic structure, concurrency, and low-level hardware interactions. Prior efforts such as KGym and CrashFixer have highlighted the difficulty of APR in this domain, reporting low success rates or relying on costly and complex pipelines and pricey cloud infrastructure. In this work, we introduce RGym, a lightweight, platform-agnostic APR evaluation framework for the Linux kernel designed to operate on local commodity hardware. Built on RGym, we propose a simple yet effective APR pipeline leveraging specialized localization techniques (e.g., call stacks and blamed commits) to overcome the unrealistic usage of oracles in KGym. We test on a filtered and verified dataset of 143 bugs. Our method achieves up to a 43.36% pass rate with GPT-5 Thinking while maintaining a cost of under $0.20 per bug. We further conduct an ablation study to analyze contributions from our proposed localization strategy, prompt structure, and model choice, and demonstrate that feedback-based retries can significantly enhance success rates.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) introduce code smells and proposes metrics and strategies to mitigate these issues, improving the structural quality of generated code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns regarding the structural quality of code produced by LLMs, particularly the generation of code smells which hinder readability, maintainability, and design integrity.

Method: Utilized the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC) to measure smell likelihood in LLM-generated code and employed it for causal analysis, exploring factors like generation strategy, model size, architecture, and prompt formulation that influence smell propensity.

Result: The study found prompt design and architectural choices significantly affect smell propensity. It introduced mitigation strategies to reduce code smells and demonstrated PSC's utility in helping developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the importance of integrating quality-aware assessments, like PSC, into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code generation to enhance structural quality and support human judgement.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code.
  This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.

Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional ERP systems in dynamic healthcare environments.

Method: Used AI for event orchestration, anomaly detection, and process mining in Workday ERP.

Result: Improved process efficiency, cost visibility, and decision accuracy across healthcare entities.

Conclusion: AI-driven ERP integration strengthens operational resilience and scalability in healthcare.

Abstract: The adoption of cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms such as Workday has transformed healthcare operations by integrating financial, supply-chain, and workforce processes into a unified ecosystem.

The framework employs machine-learning triggers, anomaly detection, and process mining analytics to anticipate and automate responses to operational events such as inventory depletion, payment delays, or patient demand fluctuations. A multi-organization case analysis demonstrates measurable gains in process efficiency, cost visibility, and decision accuracy.
  Results confirm that embedding AI capabilities into Workday's event-based architecture enhances operational resilience, governance, and scalability. The proposed model contributes to the broader understanding of intelligent ERP integration and establishes a reference for next-generation automation strategies in healthcare enterprises.

Our study investigates how annotation requirements are defined and used in practice, the challenges in ensuring their quality, practitioner-recommended improvements, and their impact on AIePS development and performance. We conducted $19$ semi-structured interviews with participants from six international companies and four research organisations. Our thematic analysis reveals five main key challenges: ambiguity, edge case complexity, evolving requirements, inconsistencies, and resource constraints and three main categories of best practices, including ensuring compliance with ethical standards, improving data annotation requirements guidelines, and embedded quality assurance for data annotation requirements. We also uncover critical interrelationships between annotation requirements, annotation practices, annotated data quality, and AIePS performance and development, showing how requirement flaws propagate through the AIePS development pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer empirically grounded guidance on improving annotation requirements, offering actionable insights to enhance annotation quality, regulatory compliance, and system reliability.

TL;DR: InfCode is a framework utilizing adversarial multi-agent interactions to refine software issue resolution, outperforming existing baselines with containerized repository-level operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world software issues are challenging due to the need for repository-level reasoning, precise diagnostics, and reliable verification mechanisms—existing methods fail to provide robust solutions.

Method: InfCode employs two key agents—a Test Patch Generator and a Code Patch Generator—that refine tests and patches adversarially, with a Selector agent to pick reliable fixes in a containerized environment for repository-level operations.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that InfCode achieves a 79.4% performance on SWE-bench Verified, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: InfCode establishes itself as a new standard in repository-level issue resolution by combining adversarial interaction, refinement processes, and rigorous validation, and is released as an open-source tool.

Abstract: Large language models have advanced software engineering automation, yet resolving real-world software issues remains difficult because it requires repository-level reasoning, accurate diagnostics, and strong verification signals. Existing agent-based and pipeline-based methods often rely on insufficient tests, which can lead to patches that satisfy verification but fail to fix the underlying defect. We present InfCode, an adversarial multi-agent framework for automated repository-level issue resolution. InfCode iteratively refines both tests and patches through adversarial interaction between a Test Patch Generator and a Code Patch Generator, while a Selector agent identifies the most reliable fix. The framework runs inside a containerized environment that supports realistic repository inspection, modification, and validation. Experiments on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified using models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show that InfCode consistently outperforms strong baselines. It achieves 79.4% performance on SWE-bench Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art. We have released InfCode as an open-source project at https://github.com/Tokfinity/InfCode.

TL;DR: LLM agents struggle with C++ issue resolution, but INFCODE-C++ offers a new approach with semantic retrieval and structured queries, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM systems are designed for Python and falter on C++ repositories due to deep structural complexities and the lack of language-aware retrieval mechanisms.

Method: INFCODE-C++ introduces semantic code-intent retrieval alongside deterministic AST-structured querying, enabling accurate and robust solutions for C++ issue resolution.

Result: INFCODE-C++ achieved a 25.58% resolution rate on MultiSWE-bench-CPP, surpassing previous agents by a substantial margin.

Conclusion: INFCODE-C++ underscores the importance of language-aware systems for multi-language issue resolution and sets the stage for further LLM research in statically typed environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong performance on repository-level issue resolution, but existing systems are almost exclusively designed for Python and rely heavily on lexical retrieval and shallow code navigation. These approaches transfer poorly to C++ projects, where overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and deep control-flow structures make context retrieval and fault localization substantially more difficult. As a result, state-of-the-art Python-oriented agents show a drastic performance drop on the C++ subset of MultiSWE-bench. We introduce INFCODE-C++, the first C++-aware autonomous system for end-to-end issue resolution. The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms -- semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying -- to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair.These components enable precise localization and robust patch synthesis in large, statically typed C++ repositories. Evaluated on the \texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution. INFCODE-C++ highlights the need for language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents and establishes a foundation for future research on scalable, LLM-driven repair for complex, statically typed ecosystems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for unifying textual vulnerability descriptions (TVDs) using domain-constrained language model methods, achieving better consistency and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address inconsistencies in TVDs from different repositories, which hinder comprehensive vulnerability understanding.

Method: The paper uses a three-stage framework comprising Extraction (rule-based templates), Self-evaluation (anchor words for semantic assessment), and Fusion (entropy-based reconciliation).

Result: The framework increases the F1 score from 0.82 to 0.87, improves comprehension and efficiency by over 30%, and introduces Digest Labels for usability enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully synthesizes TVDs, enhancing consistency, performance, and usability for security analysts.

Abstract: Textual Vulnerability Descriptions (TVDs) are crucial for security analysts to understand and address software vulnerabilities. However, the key aspect inconsistencies in TVDs from different repositories pose challenges for achieving a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities. Existing approaches aim to mitigate inconsistencies by aligning TVDs with external knowledge bases, but they often discard valuable information and fail to synthesize comprehensive representations. In this paper, we propose a domain-constrained LLM-based synthesis framework for unifying key aspects of TVDs. Our framework consists of three stages: 1) Extraction, guided by rule-based templates to ensure all critical details are captured; 2) Self-evaluation, using domain-specific anchor words to assess semantic variability across sources; and 3) Fusion, leveraging information entropy to reconcile inconsistencies and prioritize relevant details. This framework improves synthesis performance, increasing the F1 score for key aspect augmentation from 0.82 to 0.87, while enhancing comprehension and efficiency by over 30\%. We further develop Digest Labels, a practical tool for visualizing TVDs, which human evaluations show significantly boosts usability.

*Francesco Salzano,Simone Scalabrino,Rocco Oliveto,Simone Scalabrino*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of LLMs in generating Smart Contract code, highlighting their functional correctness issues and potential improvements using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of comprehensive evaluation of LLM-generated Solidity code under the specific constraints of Smart Contracts.

Method: The study benchmarks four state-of-the-art models using zero-shot and RAG settings across 500 functions, applying metrics like code similarity, semantic embeddings, testing, gas profiling, and complexity analysis.

Result: LLMs generate code with high semantic similarity but low functional correctness (20-26% in zero-shot). RAG improves functional correctness up to 45% with more concise and efficient code.

Conclusion: While RAG enhances code generation, the reliability of LLM-produced Smart Contracts is limited, requiring expert validation to achieve production-ready results.

Abstract: Smart Contracts are critical components of blockchain ecosystems, with Solidity as the dominant programming language. While LLMs excel at general-purpose code generation, the unique constraints of Smart Contracts, such as gas consumption, security, and determinism, raise open questions about the reliability of LLM-generated Solidity code. Existing studies lack a comprehensive evaluation of these critical functional and non-functional properties. We benchmark four state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation settings across 500 real-world functions. Our multi-faceted assessment employs code similarity metrics, semantic embeddings, automated test execution, gas profiling, and cognitive and cyclomatic complexity analysis. Results show that while LLMs produce code with high semantic similarity to real contracts, their functional correctness is low: only 20% to 26% of zero-shot generations behave identically to ground-truth implementations under testing. The generated code is consistently simpler, with significantly lower complexity and gas consumption, often due to omitted validation logic. Retrieval-Augmented Generation markedly improves performance, boosting functional correctness by up to 45% and yielding more concise and efficient code. Our findings reveal a significant gap between semantic similarity and functional plausibility in LLM-generated Smart Contracts. We conclude that while RAG is a powerful enhancer, achieving robust, production-ready code generation remains a substantial challenge, necessitating careful expert validation.

*Hina Saeeda,Tommy Johansson,Mazen Mohamad,Eric Knauss*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study identifies 18 recurring annotation error types in AI data annotation for automated driving and provides a taxonomy validated by industry experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the problem of annotation errors in AI-enabled perception systems for automated driving, which severely impact model performance, safety, and reliability. It focuses on the lack of empirical understanding in how annotation errors arise and spread across the automotive supply chain.

Method: The study conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 experts from six companies and four research institutes across Europe and the UK. A six-phase thematic analysis was performed on 50 hours of interview transcripts to identify patterns and develop a taxonomy.

Result: A taxonomy of 18 annotation error types was developed, categorized into three data-quality dimensions: completeness (e.g., attribute omission), accuracy (e.g., mislabelling), and consistency (e.g., inter-annotator disagreement). The taxonomy was validated with industry practitioners for practical applications.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a shared vocabulary and diagnostic tools to improve annotation quality in AI-enabled perception systems. It highlights annotation quality as a lifecycle and supply-chain issue, offering guidance to enhance trustworthiness in AI systems.

Abstract: Data annotation is essential but highly error-prone in the development of AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) for automated driving, and its quality directly influences model performance, safety, and reliability. However, the industry lacks empirical insights into how annotation errors emerge and spread across the multi-organisational automotive supply chain. This study addresses this gap through a multi-organisation case study involving six companies and four research institutes across Europe and the UK. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews with 20 experts (50 hours of transcripts) and a six-phase thematic analysis, we develop a taxonomy of 18 recurring annotation error types across three data-quality dimensions: completeness (e.g., attribute omission, missing feedback loops, edge-case omissions, selection bias), accuracy (e.g., mislabelling, bounding-box inaccuracies, granularity mismatches, bias-driven errors), and consistency (e.g., inter-annotator disagreement, ambiguous instructions, misaligned hand-offs, cross-modality inconsistencies). The taxonomy was validated with industry practitioners, who reported its usefulness for root-cause analysis, supplier quality reviews, onboarding, and improving annotation guidelines. They described it as a failure-mode catalogue similar to FMEA. By conceptualising annotation quality as a lifecycle and supply-chain issue, this study contributes to SE4AI by offering a shared vocabulary, diagnostic toolset, and actionable guidance for building trustworthy AI-enabled perception systems.

### [316] [Green Resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems: Doctoral Dissertation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16593)
*Diaeddin Rimawi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes strategies for balancing resilience and energy efficiency (greenness) in Online Collaborative AI Systems (OL-CAIS) during disruptions using multi-objective optimization, game theory, and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerability to disruptive events and balance performance recovery and energy efficiency in Online Collaborative AI Systems (OL-CAIS).

Method: The authors model resilience via states (steady, disruptive, final), introduce the GResilience framework for recovery strategies using multi-agent methods, and design measurement metrics for resilience and greenness.

Result: Findings indicate improved green recovery, reduced recovery time, stable performance, and reduced human dependency. RL-agent solutions perform strongest but slightly increase CO2 emissions. Containerization reduces emissions significantly.

Conclusion: The work advances OL-CAIS with frameworks, policies, and metrics ensuring performance recovery while minimizing energy impact, contributing to both resilience and greenness of such systems.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.

*Gabriel Marghoti,Thiago L. Prado,Miguel A. F. Sanjuán,Sergio R. Lopes*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study uses a simulated neuronal network to analyze frequency allocation's role in synchronization dynamics and identifies characteristic transition times influenced by beat frequency statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how frequency allocations affect neuronal synchronization dynamics, which is key in brain information processing.

Method: Simulation of a network of Izhikevich neurons to examine frequency effects and their role in intermittent synchronization dynamics.

Result: Emergence of new frequency modes during bifurcation, characteristic transition times linked to beat frequency gaps, and improved prediction capabilities for beat-frequency-driven transitions.

Conclusion: Frequency changes drive predictable synchronization dynamics, enhancing understanding and providing tools for complex system analysis where beat frequencies are critical.

Abstract: In neurosciences, the brain processes information via the firing patterns of connected neurons operating across a spectrum of frequencies. To better understand the effects of these frequencies in the neuron dynamics, we have simulated a neuronal network of Izhikevich neurons to examine the interaction between frequency allocation and intermittent phase synchronization dynamics. As the synchronized population of neurons passes through a bifurcation, an additional frequency mode emerges, enabling a match in the mean frequency while retaining distinct most probable frequencies among neurons. Subsequently, the network intermittently transits between two patterns, one partially synchronized and the other unsynchronized. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the frequency changes on the network lead to characteristic transition times between synchronization states. Moreover, these transitions adhere to beat frequency statistics when the neurons' frequencies differ by multiples of a frequency gap. Finally, our results can improve the performance in predicting transitions on problems where the beat frequency strongly influences the dynamics.

*Mu Niu,Yue Zhang,Ke Ye,Pokman Cheung,Yizhu Wang,Xiaochen Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Riemannian-corrected Atlas Gaussian Processes (RC-AGPs) to improve regression tasks by addressing challenges in high-dimensional data on unknown geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gaussian Processes (GPs) struggle to capture underlying geometry in data with unknown boundaries, high dimensions, or nontrivial manifold structures.

Method: The authors develop the Atlas Brownian Motion (BM) framework for heat kernel estimation and propose RC-AGPs, combining global heat kernels with local RBF kernels for improved regression performance.

Result: RC-AGPs outperform existing methods in heat kernel estimation and regression across synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively addressing complex data structures.

Conclusion: The proposed RC-AGPs enhance statistical inference by bridging the gap between high-dimensional observations and manifold-based insights, significantly advancing performance in varied datasets.

Abstract: In real-world applications, data often reside in restricted domains with unknown boundaries, or as high-dimensional point clouds lying on a lower-dimensional, nontrivial, unknown manifold. Traditional Gaussian Processes (GPs) struggle to capture the underlying geometry in such settings. Some existing methods assume a flat space embedded in a point cloud, which can be represented by a single latent chart (latent space), while others exhibit weak performance when the point cloud is sparse or irregularly sampled. The goal of this work is to address these challenges. The main contributions are twofold: (1) We establish the Atlas Brownian Motion (BM) framework for estimating the heat kernel on point clouds with unknown geometries and nontrivial topological structures; (2) Instead of directly using the heat kernel estimates, we construct a Riemannian corrected kernel by combining the global heat kernel with local RBF kernel and leading to the formulation of Riemannian-corrected Atlas Gaussian Processes (RC-AGPs). The resulting RC-AGPs are applied to regression tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets. These examples demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both heat kernel estimation and regression accuracy. It improves statistical inference by effectively bridging the gap between complex, high-dimensional observations and manifold-based inferences.

### [319] [Angular Graph Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16111)
*Feiyue Zhao,Yangfan He,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the angular graph fractional Fourier transform (AGFRFT), addressing limitations of existing methods in graph spectral analysis and showing improved performance in various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve shortcomings in the graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) and angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT), specifically their lack of angular regulation and degeneracy at zero angles, respectively.

Method: The study proposes AGFRFT, integrating fractional-order and angular spectral analyses through a degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family. Two variants, I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT, are developed, allowing learnable joint parameterization of angle and fractional order.

Result: Theoretical analyses verify the unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence of AGFRFT. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance in spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and spectral manipulation in data denoising tasks.

Conclusion: AGFRFT emerges as a robust and flexible framework for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis, addressing prior limitations while enhancing graph signal processing capabilities.

Abstract: Graph spectral representations are fundamental in graph signal processing, offering a rigorous framework for analyzing and processing graph-structured data. The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.

### [320] [Spectral Identifiability for Interpretable Probe Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16288)
*William Hao-Cheng Huang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study reveals that linear probes, often used for assessing neural representations, remain inconsistent under certain conditions due to spectral mechanisms. The Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP) ensures reliable probe stability when specific conditions involving eigengap and Fisher estimation error are met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability of linear probes in interpreting and evaluating neural representations often fluctuates, raising concerns about their stability under different conditions.

Method: The paper introduces the Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP), using spectral mechanisms and Fisher reasoning to diagnose instability. It connects properties like eigengap geometry and Fisher estimation error to probe reliability.

Result: Through controlled synthetic experiments, the study verifies SIP's predictions, showing that spectral properties can anticipate and diagnose unreliable probes before affecting downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The findings propose a diagnostic framework for reliable probe evaluations, emphasizing the importance of eigengap geometry and Fisher-inspired quantities for maintaining stability.

Abstract: Linear probes are widely used to interpret and evaluate neural representations, yet their reliability remains unclear, as probes may appear accurate in some regimes but collapse unpredictably in others. We uncover a spectral mechanism behind this phenomenon and formalize it as the Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP), a verifiable Fisher-inspired condition for probe stability. When the eigengap separating task-relevant directions is larger than the Fisher estimation error, the estimated subspace concentrates and accuracy remains consistent, whereas closing this gap induces instability in a phase-transition manner. Our analysis connects eigengap geometry, sample size, and misclassification risk through finite-sample reasoning, providing an interpretable diagnostic rather than a loose generalization bound. Controlled synthetic studies, where Fisher quantities are computed exactly, confirm these predictions and show how spectral inspection can anticipate unreliable probes before they distort downstream evaluation.

### [321] [Time dependent loss reweighting for flow matching and diffusion models is theoretically justified](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16599)
*Lukas Billera,Hedwig Nora Nordlinder,Ben Murrell*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the flexibility of parameters and losses in Generator Matching and Edit Flows for various spaces and justifies the use of time-dependent loss weighting schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify and theoretically justify the dependency of loss functions and linear parameterizations on both time and state in Generator Matching and Edit Flows.

Method: The paper examines the properties of Bregman divergence loss and linear parameterizations in Generator Matching and Edit Flows, highlighting their dependence on time and current state, and evaluates the role of time-weighted losses for stability in training.

Result: It establishes that time-dependent losses are theoretically sound and demonstrates their effectiveness with specific examples in Generator Matching and Edit Flows.

Conclusion: Generator Matching and Edit Flows are versatile frameworks that support time and state-dependent loss definitions, leading to stable training and simplifying certain predictor schemes.

Abstract: This brief note clarifies that, in Generator Matching (which subsumes a large family of flow matching and diffusion models over continuous, manifold, and discrete spaces), both the Bregman divergence loss and the linear parameterization of the generator can depend on both the current state $X_t$ and the time $t$, and we show that the expectation over time in the loss can be taken with respect to a broad class of time distributions. We also show this for Edit Flows, which falls outside of Generator Matching. That the loss can depend on $t$ clarifies that time-dependent loss weighting schemes, often used in practice to stabilize training, are theoretically justified when the specific flow or diffusion scheme is a special case of Generator Matching (or Edit Flows). It also often simplifies the construction of $X_1$-predictor schemes, which are sometimes preferred for model-related reasons. We show examples that rely upon the dependence of linear parameterizations, and of the Bregman divergence loss, on $t$ and $X_t$.

*Jingqiu Ding,Yiding Hua,Kasper Lindberg,David Steurer,Aleksandr Storozhenko*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper focuses on community detection in the symmetric $k$-stochastic block model, proposing a polynomial-time algorithm achieving minimax-optimal misclassification rates near the Kesten-Stigum threshold, even under adversarial corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve community detection algorithms in symmetric $k$-stochastic block models while matching the minimax-optimal misclassification rate efficiently under realistic thresholds and adversarial settings.

Method: The approach combines robustifying majority voting with the Sum-of-Squares framework and introduces a novel graph bisection algorithm using robust majority voting.

Result: This polynomial-time algorithm achieves the minimax rate under near-optimal conditions, closing existing gaps and outperforming previous algorithms under adversarial corruption and realistic thresholds.

Conclusion: The authors present the first polynomial-time solution achieving minimax rates near the Kesten-Stigum threshold, improving upon previous assumptions and performance under both normal and adversarial conditions.

Abstract: We study community detection in the \emph{symmetric $k$-stochastic block model}, where $n$ nodes are evenly partitioned into $k$ clusters with intra- and inter-cluster connection probabilities $p$ and $q$, respectively.
  Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax-optimal misclassification rate
  \begin{equation*}
  \exp \Bigl(-\bigl(1 \pm o(1)\bigr) \tfrac{C}{k}\Bigr),
  \quad \text{where } C = (\sqrt{pn} - \sqrt{qn})^2,
  \end{equation*}
  whenever $C \ge K\,k^2\,\log k$ for some universal constant $K$, matching the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold up to a $\log k$ factor.
  Notably, this rate holds even when an adversary corrupts an $η\le \exp\bigl(- (1 \pm o(1)) \tfrac{C}{k}\bigr)$ fraction of the nodes.
  To the best of our knowledge, the minimax rate was previously only attainable either via computationally inefficient procedures [ZZ15] or via polynomial-time algorithms that require strictly stronger assumptions such as $C \ge K k^3$ [GMZZ17].
  In the node-robust setting, the best known algorithm requires the substantially stronger condition $C \ge K k^{102}$ [LM22].
  Our results close this gap by providing the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax rate near the KS threshold in both settings.
  Our work has two key technical contributions:
  (1) we robustify majority voting via the Sum-of-Squares framework,
  (2) we develop a novel graph bisection algorithm via robust majority voting, which allows us to significantly improve the misclassification rate to $1/\mathrm{poly}(k)$ for the initial estimation near the KS threshold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current libraries for large symmetric eigenvalue decomposition on multi-GPU architectures underperform, reaching only 1.5% of peak performance.

Method: This paper develops a novel pipelined two-stage eigenvalue decomposition algorithm with extensive optimizations.

Result: On an 8×A100 multi-GPU platform, the proposed implementation outperforms cuSOLVERMp and MAGMA, achieving average speedups of 5.74× and 6.59×, respectively, with improved scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm significantly enhances computing efficiency for large symmetric eigenvalue problems on advanced GPU platforms, outperforming state-of-the-art libraries.

Abstract: Large symmetric eigenvalue problems are commonly observed in many disciplines such as Chemistry and Physics, and several libraries including cuSOLVERMp, MAGMA and ELPA support computing large eigenvalue decomposition on multi-GPU or multi-CPU-GPU hybrid architectures. However, these libraries do not provide satisfied performance that all of the libraries only utilize around 1.5\% of the peak multi-GPU performance. In this paper, we propose a pipelined two-stage eigenvalue decomposition algorithm instead of conventional subsequent algorithm with substantial optimizations. On an 8$\times$A100 platform, our implementation surpasses state-of-the-art cuSOLVERMp and MAGMA baselines, delivering mean speedups of 5.74$\times$ and 6.59$\times$, with better strong and weak scalability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QueryGym, a Python toolkit for LLM-based query reformulation, aiming to enhance retrieval effectiveness and standardize comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind QueryGym is to address the lack of a unified toolkit for LLM-based query reformulation methods, which hinders fair comparison, experimentation, benchmarking, and deployment.

Method: The proposed toolkit includes a Python API, retrieval-agnostic integration interfaces, centralized prompt management with versioning, benchmarking support, and an open-source implementation.

Result: QueryGym simplifies comparative evaluations, supports experiments, and boosts the usability of various LLM-based reformulation methods in research and applications.

Conclusion: QueryGym fills a critical gap by offering a unified and extensible framework, facilitating advancements in LLM-based query reformulation research and practical applications.

Abstract: We present QueryGym, a lightweight, extensible Python toolkit that supports large language model (LLM)-based query reformulation. This is an important tool development since recent work on llm-based query reformulation has shown notable increase in retrieval effectiveness. However, while different authors have sporadically shared the implementation of their methods, there is no unified toolkit that provides a consistent implementation of such methods, which hinders fair comparison, rapid experimentation, consistent benchmarking and reliable deployment. QueryGym addresses this gap by providing a unified framework for implementing, executing, and comparing llm-based reformulation methods. The toolkit offers: (1) a Python API for applying diverse LLM-based methods, (2) a retrieval-agnostic interface supporting integration with backends such as Pyserini and PyTerrier, (3) a centralized prompt management system with versioning and metadata tracking, (4) built-in support for benchmarks like BEIR and MS MARCO, and (5) a completely open-source extensible implementation available to all researchers.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper reviews the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Music Recommender Systems (MRS), particularly in reshaping evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in the traditional information-retrieval paradigm for MRS and adapt to the challenges and opportunities brought by LLMs.

Method: The authors analyze how LLMs reshape aspects of MRS (e.g., user/item modeling, natural-language recommendation) and review evaluation methods from NLP to apply insights to MRS.

Result: The study identifies methodologies and challenges tied to LLM-based MRS and provides a structured framework of success and risk dimensions for evaluation.

Conclusion: LLM-driven MRS necessitates a rethinking of evaluation practices, with insights bridging gaps between MRS and NLP for more holistic, adaptable evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Music Recommender Systems (MRS) have long relied on an information-retrieval framing, where progress is measured mainly through accuracy on retrieval-oriented subtasks. While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators.
  This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music. We then examine evaluation practices from NLP, highlighting methodologies and open challenges relevant to MRS. Finally, we synthesize insights-focusing on how LLM prompting applies to MRS, to outline a structured set of success and risk dimensions. Our goal is to provide the MRS community with an updated, pedagogical, and cross-disciplinary perspective on evaluation.

*Jiaheng Zhang,Daqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prism, a framework for explainable recommendation systems that decouples ranking and explanation generation processes, achieving improved efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current integration of Large Language Models into recommendation systems faces trade-offs in efficiency and performance due to joint optimization, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Prism adopts a decoupled framework where a powerful LLM, acting as a teacher, generates high-quality explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model synthesizes this knowledge into personalized recommendations, leveraging knowledge distillation.

Result: The 140M-parameter Prism model surpasses its 11B-parameter teacher model in human evaluations for faithfulness and personalization while being 24 times faster and consuming 10 times less memory.

Conclusion: Decoupling the recommendation process and applying targeted distillation enables significant improvements in both explanation quality and system efficiency for explainable recommendation systems.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage.
  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.
  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aimed to enhance emotion recognition accuracy using EEG signals and improve accessibility through reduced equipment requirements.

Method: A CNN-Transformer architecture was trained on a large, culturally-diverse EEG dataset (SEED, SEED-FRA, SEED-GER) with 1,455 labeled samples, using 5 electrodes instead of 62.

Result: The model outperformed traditional methods (SVM, DNN, Logistic Regression) with a testing accuracy of 91%.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for affordable EEG technology in daily emotional monitoring, offering significant benefits for mental health diagnostics and interventions.

Abstract: An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...

Motivation: Develop a scalable, comfortable, and private motion-capture system for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing that doesn't rely on intrusive hardware or cameras.

Method: The system uses conductive textile patches integrated into pants, employing a compact acquisition unit and a lightweight Transformer-based model to map capacitance signals to joint angles.

Result: The model recorded high accuracy, with MPJPE of 11.96 cm and MPJAE of 12.3 degrees. It also performs real-time inference at 42 FPS on a smartwatch with minimal computational demands.

Conclusion: VersaPants demonstrates the feasibility of a compact, privacy-preserving, and scalable solution for lower-body motion capture, suitable for fitness and healthcare applications.

Abstract: We present VersaPants, the first loose-fitting, textile-based capacitive sensing system for lower-body motion capture, built on the open-hardware VersaSens platform. By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.

### [329] [The Ensemble Kalman Inversion Race](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15853)
*Rebecca Gjini,Matthias Morzfeld,Oliver R. A. Dunbar,Tapio Schneider*

Main category: physics.data-an

TL;DR: The paper addresses climate model calibration using ensemble Kalman methods, highlighting their scalability, robustness, and suitability for noisy loss landscapes. It conducts systematic experiments to compare methods and identifies their efficiency in various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the increasing complexity of climate models due to the integration of machine learning, necessitating robust parameter calibration to minimize the misfit between modeled and observed climate statistics.

Method: Systematic numerical experiments compare several ensemble Kalman methods and a derivative-based method for their computational efficiencies in climate model calibration, using Lorenz-type models and neural network parameterizations.

Result: The study highlights computational advantages of ensemble Kalman methods over derivative-based methods, particularly in noisy loss landscapes, and explores the influence of prior information and dimensionality on method selection.

Conclusion: Ensemble Kalman methods are effective for robust climate model calibration in complex, high-dimensional, and noisy environments, significantly outperforming derivative-based approaches.

Abstract: Ensemble Kalman methods were initially developed to solve nonlinear data assimilation problems in oceanography, but are now popular in applications far beyond their original use cases. Of particular interest is climate model calibration. As hybrid physics and machine-learning models evolve, the number of parameters and complexity of parameterizations in climate models will continue to grow. Thus, robust calibration of these parameters plays an increasingly important role. We focus on learning climate model parameters from minimizing the misfit between modeled and observed climate statistics in an idealized setting. Ensemble Kalman methods are a natural choice for this problem because they are derivative-free, scalable to high dimensions, and robust to noise caused by statistical observations. Given the many variants of ensemble methods proposed, an important question is: Which ensemble Kalman method should be used for climate model calibration? To answer this question, we perform systematic numerical experiments to explore the relative computational efficiencies of several ensemble Kalman methods. The numerical experiments involve statistical observations of Lorenz-type models of increasing complexity, frequently used to represent simplified atmospheric systems, and some feature neural network parameterizations. For each test problem, several ensemble Kalman methods and a derivative-based method "race" to reach a specified accuracy, and we measure the computational cost required to achieve the desired accuracy. We investigate how prior information and the parameter or data dimensions play a role in choosing the ensemble method variant. The derivative-based method consistently fails to complete the race because it does not adaptively handle the noisy loss landscape.

### [330] [Human-aligned Quantification of Numerical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15723)
*Anton Kolonin*

Main category: physics.data-an

TL;DR: The paper explores using metrics like the Silhouette coefficient and information compression for quantifying numerical data, focusing on their correlation and alignment with human intuition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if numerical data can be naturally quantified and classify data into meaningful categories that align with intuitive or statistical insights.

Method: Utilized the Silhouette coefficient and an information compression-based normalized centroid distance method to analyze the ability of numerical data to form distinct value categories.

Result: Found that classification of data into meaningful categories is possible with a Silhouette coefficient above 0.65 and a Dip Test below 0.5. Additionally, the Silhouette coefficient was found to align better with human intuition compared to the normalized centroid distance.

Conclusion: The Silhouette coefficient is a reliable metric for identifying distinct numerical categories and aligns closely with human intuition, making it more effective than the alternative information compression metric.

Abstract: Quantifying numerical data involves addressing two key challenges: first, determining whether the data can be naturally quantified, and second, identifying the numerical intervals or ranges of values that correspond to specific value classes, referred to as "quantums," which represent statistically meaningful states. If such quantification is feasible, continuous streams of numerical data can be transformed into sequences of "symbols" that reflect the states of the system described by the measured parameter. People often perform this task intuitively, relying on common sense or practical experience, while information theory and computer science offer computable metrics for this purpose. In this study, we assess the applicability of metrics based on information compression and the Silhouette coefficient for quantifying numerical data. We also investigate the extent to which these metrics correlate with one another and with what is commonly referred to as "human intuition." Our findings suggest that the ability to classify numeric data values into distinct categories is associated with a Silhouette coefficient above 0.65 and a Dip Test below 0.5; otherwise, the data can be treated as following a unimodal normal distribution. Furthermore, when quantification is possible, the Silhouette coefficient appears to align more closely with human intuition than the "normalized centroid distance" method derived from information compression perspective.

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to enhance the accuracy of electric field simulations in brain stimulation by incorporating mesoscale conductivity variations, linking macroscopic and microscopic tissue models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current brain stimulation models that omit mesoscale conductivity variations despite their significant influence on electric fields and neural activation thresholds.

Method: The authors propose bridging macro- and microscales to derive mesoscale conductivity distributions by combining insights from microscopic tissue models and macroscopic assumptions.

Result: The study identifies mesoscale conductivity as a crucial factor for accurate multiscale modeling of electric fields and neural activation, emphasizing its role in improving brain stimulation simulations.

Conclusion: Incorporating mesoscale conductivity variations offers a robust foundation for developing accurate and consistent multiscale electric field simulations for brain stimulation.

Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.

### [332] [Maximum Dispersion, Maximum Concentration: Enhancing the Quality of MOP Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22568)
*Gladston Moreira,Ivan Meneghini,Elizabeth Wanner*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance multi-objective optimization (MOP) by optimizing solution dispersion in the decision space and convergence in a defined Region of Interest (ROI) within the objective space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-objective optimization often suffers from the challenge of balancing diversity and convergence while mitigating bias in solution clustering.

Method: This approach uses a cone-shaped Region of Interest (ROI) in the objective space to focus solutions based on decision-maker preferences and incorporates uniformity measures to enhance solution dispersion in the decision space.

Result: Preliminary experiments show improved balance between dispersion and convergence in MOP solutions, with reduced bias in the decision space.

Conclusion: The method improves the quality of MOP solutions by effectively combining dispersion and concentration attributes, offering a better trade-off between conflicting objectives.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision space.

### [333] [A Fast Relax-and-Round Approach to Unit Commitment for Data Center Own Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16420)
*Shaked Regev,Eve Tsybina,Slaven Peles*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unit commitment formulation for data centers with large numbers of generators, reducing solution time from hours to seconds using fractional unit commitment and GPU-compatible parallel computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for data centers to use their generators alongside utility power plants increases emphasis on fuel costs and challenges traditional unit commitment methods designed for fewer, slower units.

Method: The authors propose relaxing binary commitment decisions, allowing generators to be fractionally on, and using a rounding approach for feasible unit commitment.

Result: This method decreased solution time for a 276-unit system from 10 hours to under a second with minor impact on accuracy, and proved scalable to thousands of units.

Conclusion: The approach is practical for addressing unit commitment issues in large-scale systems, with potential for further optimization using parallel and GPU-based computations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of data centers increasingly requires data center operators to "bring own generation" to complement the available utility power plants to supply all or part of data center load. This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with minor accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work.

TL;DR: Uniform laws of large numbers fail for subdifferentials under typical assumptions for certain random functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether uniform laws of large numbers hold for subdifferentials in random settings, as questioned by previous researchers.

Method: Constructing counterexamples involving random Lipschitz and convex functions with finite smooth segments to test uniform laws applicability.

Result: Demonstrated that nonsmoothness invalidates uniform laws for subdifferentials, answering Shapiro and Xu's earlier queries negatively.

Conclusion: Nonsmoothness in random functions creates significant barriers to applying uniform laws of large numbers for subdifferentials.

Abstract: We provide counterexamples showing that uniform laws of large numbers do not hold for subdifferentials under natural assumptions. Our results apply to random Lipschitz functions and random convex functions with a finite number of smooth pieces. Consequently, they resolve the questions posed by Shapiro and Xu [J. Math. Anal. Appl., 325(2), 2007] in the negative and highlight the obstacles nonsmoothness poses to uniform results.

*Taejun Kim,Youngbo Aram Shim,Geehyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the delivery of alphanumeric characters through spatial-temporal tactile patterns on wrist-worn tactile displays, enhancing recognition accuracy with a unique vibrotactile stimuli design called Heterogeneous Stroke.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to address frequent confusions and low recognition accuracy in spatiotemporal tactile patterns on wrist-worn displays due to limited skin area and spatial acuity of the wrist, especially under varying arm postures.

Method: The authors introduced and implemented the Heterogeneous Stroke approach, assigning unique vibrotactile stimuli to each tactor on wrist-worn tactile displays, reducing confusions and improving recognition accuracy.

Result: The Heterogeneous Stroke design significantly improved recognition accuracy, achieving 93.8% accuracy for 26 alphabets and 92.4% accuracy for 10 digits, even across different arm postures.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that unique vibrotactile stimuli designs, like Heterogeneous Stroke, enhance recognition accuracy for alphanumeric characters, overcoming limitations of the wrist's spatial acuity and real-life posture variability.

Abstract: Beyond a simple notification of incoming calls or messages, more complex information such as alphabets and digits can be delivered through spatiotemporal tactile patterns (STPs) on a wrist-worn tactile display (WTD) with multiple tactors. However, owing to the limited skin area and spatial acuity of the wrist, frequent confusions occur between closely located tactors, resulting in a low recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the accuracies reported in previous studies have mostly been measured for a specific posture and could further decrease with free arm postures in real life. Herein, we present Heterogeneous Stroke, a design concept for improving the recognition accuracy of STPs on a WTD. By assigning unique vibrotactile stimuli to each tactor, the confusion between tactors can be reduced. Through our implementation of Heterogeneous Stroke, the alphanumeric characters could be delivered with high accuracy (93.8% for 26 alphabets and 92.4% for 10 digits) across different arm postures.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores how value-framing in ChatBots can influence user decisions without partisan bias or misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if framing can persuade users without overt bias or misinformation.

Method: Participants interacted with chatbots framed neutrally or based on values while deciding on US defense spending.

Result: Value-framed ChatBots significantly influenced participant decisions and revealed a potential backfire effect when frames misaligned with personal values.

Conclusion: Value-framing in ChatBots poses risks of manipulation even without overt bias, highlighting new challenges to counter misinformation.

Abstract: Similar to social media bots that shape public opinion, healthcare and financial decisions, LLM-based ChatBots like ChatGPT can persuade users to alter their behavior. Unlike prior work that persuades via overt-partisan bias or misinformation, we test whether framing alone suffices. We conducted a crowdsourced study, where 336 participants interacted with a neutral or one of two value-framed ChatBots while deciding to alter US defense spending. In this single policy domain with controlled content, participants exposed to value-framed ChatBots significantly changed their budget choices relative to the neutral control. When the frame misaligned with their values, some participants reinforced their original preference, revealing a potentially replicable backfire effect, originally considered rare in the literature. These findings suggest that value-framing alone lowers the barrier for manipulative uses of LLMs, revealing risks distinct from overt bias or misinformation, and clarifying risks to countering misinformation.

TL;DR: The study evaluates machine learning models for forecasting binary options movements and finds that none outperform the ZeroR baseline accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether machine learning can effectively predict binary options movements given the field's inherent stochastic nature.

Method: Various algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, k-Nearest Neighbors, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, and Long Short-Term Memory networks were tested using EUR/USD currency data (2021–2023) before and after hyperparameter optimization.

Result: All tested models failed to outperform the ZeroR baseline accuracy, indicating the randomness in binary options.

Conclusion: Binary options movements are inherently unpredictable, making them unsuitable for machine learning-based forecasting.

Abstract: Binary options trading is often marketed as a field where predictive models can generate consistent profits. However, the inherent randomness and stochastic nature of binary options make price movements highly unpredictable, posing significant challenges for any forecasting approach. This study demonstrates that machine learning algorithms struggle to outperform a simple baseline in predicting binary options movements. Using a dataset of EUR/USD currency pairs from 2021 to 2023, we tested multiple models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), both before and after hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, several neural network architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, were evaluated under different training conditions. Despite these exhaustive efforts, none of the models surpassed the ZeroR baseline accuracy, highlighting the inherent randomness of binary options. These findings reinforce the notion that binary options lack predictable patterns, making them unsuitable for machine learning-based forecasting.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UniUltra, a solution for adapting SAM2 for ultrasound imaging, addressing efficiency and clinical deployment challenges. It introduces CH-Adapter for fine-grained perception and DSKD for knowledge distillation, drastically reducing parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2 performs poorly on ultrasound images due to domain disparities. Efficient adaptation and deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments are needed.

Method: The authors present CH-Adapter for efficient fine-tuning across diverse modalities and DSKD to compress the fine-tuned model using knowledge distillation, reducing computational requirements.

Result: UniUltra outperforms state-of-the-art methods in universal ultrasound segmentation. It uses only 8.91% of SAM2's parameters during fine-tuning and reduces the parameter count by 94.08% in the compressed model.

Conclusion: UniUltra is a practical, efficient framework for ultrasound segmentation with excellent performance and suitability for clinical deployment. The source code is publicly available.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrates remarkable universal segmentation capabilities on natural images. However, its performance on ultrasound images is significantly degraded due to domain disparities. This limitation raises two critical challenges: how to efficiently adapt SAM2 to ultrasound imaging while maintaining parameter efficiency, and how to deploy the adapted model effectively in resource-constrained clinical environments. To address these issues, we propose UniUltra for universal ultrasound segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel context-edge hybrid adapter (CH-Adapter) that enhances fine-grained perception across diverse ultrasound imaging modalities while achieving parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To further improve clinical applicability, we develop a deep-supervised knowledge distillation (DSKD) technique that transfers knowledge from the large image encoder of the fine-tuned SAM2 to a super lightweight encoder, substantially reducing computational requirements without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUltra outperforms state-of-the-arts with superior generalization capabilities. Notably, our framework achieves competitive performance using only 8.91% of SAM2's parameters during fine-tuning, and the final compressed model reduces the parameter count by 94.08% compared to the original SAM2, making it highly suitable for practical clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a robust tool for analyzing the spatial organization and morphology of alpha-synuclein aggregates in Parkinson's disease (PD) and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) using advanced image processing techniques.

Method: An automated image processing pipeline was developed employing weakly supervised segmentation and a ResNet50 classifier to differentiate major aggregate morphologies in immunohistochemical images.

Result: The approach successfully achieved a balanced accuracy of 80% in differentiating aggregate morphologies such as Lewy bodies and neurites in midbrain tissue samples.

Conclusion: The framework serves as an effective tool for large-scale characterization of alpha-synuclein aggregate patterns and their relationships with cellular components, contributing to a better understanding of Parkinson's disease pathology.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies and neuritic shape used for pathology diagnostics. Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to study how uncooperative behaviors destabilize LLM-based multi-agent systems, revealing rapid system collapse due to such behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding in how uncooperative behaviors affect the stability and effectiveness of LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Method: Introduces a game theory taxonomy and a multi-stage simulation pipeline to dynamically generate and refine uncooperative behaviors, evaluated in a collaborative resource management context.

Result: Uncooperative behaviors collapse systems within 1-7 rounds, while cooperative agents ensure full stability with 100% survival over 12 rounds and no resource overuse.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the critical need to design resilient systems to counteract uncooperative agent behaviors in multi-agent setups.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for simulating and analyzing how uncooperative behaviors can destabilize or collapse LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. We evaluate the framework via a collaborative resource management setting, measuring system stability using metrics such as survival time and resource overuse rate. Empirically, our framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors, validated by human evaluations. Our results reveal a striking contrast: cooperative agents maintain perfect system stability (100% survival over 12 rounds with 0% resource overuse), while any uncooperative behavior can trigger rapid system collapse within 1 to 7 rounds. These findings demonstrate that uncooperative agents can significantly degrade collective outcomes, highlighting the need for designing more resilient multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty users face interacting with relational databases for complex queries and administrative tasks due to the lack of intelligent and unified systems.

Method: AskDB integrates dynamic schema-aware prompting and task decomposition frameworks to autonomously debug SQL, retrieve context via web search, and refine responses.

Result: AskDB demonstrates effective performance in a Text-to-SQL benchmark and curated DBA tasks, excelling in database analysis and administration.

Conclusion: AskDB stands out as an intuitive, intelligent agent for relational databases, bridging the gap in user interaction and enhancing accessibility.

Abstract: Interacting with relational databases remains challenging for users across different expertise levels, particularly when composing complex analytical queries or performing administrative tasks. Existing systems typically address either natural language querying or narrow aspects of database administration, lacking a unified and intelligent interface for general-purpose database interaction. We introduce AskDB, a large language model powered agent designed to bridge this gap by supporting both data analysis and administrative operations over SQL databases through natural language. Built on Gemini 2, AskDB integrates two key innovations: a dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism that effectively incorporates database metadata, and a task decomposition framework that enables the agent to plan and execute multi-step actions. These capabilities allow AskDB to autonomously debug derived SQL, retrieve contextual information via real-time web search, and adaptively refine its responses. We evaluate AskDB on a widely used Text-to-SQL benchmark and a curated set of DBA tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both analytical and administrative scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of AskDB as a unified and intelligent agent for relational database systems, offering an intuitive and accessible experience for end users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metamaterials face challenges in their design process due to their complex structures. Current deep learning-based inverse design methods inadequately address reconfigurability with multi-state switching.

Method: The authors propose CoSP, which uses contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectra to develop a spectrum encoder. This encoder interacts with a pretrained LLM, combining linguistic abilities with the understanding of Maxwell's Equations to describe material structures in natural language.

Result: Experiments show that CoSP can design thin-film metamaterial structures for multi-state, multi-band optical responses with high accuracy.

Conclusion: CoSP represents a promising approach for designing reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials, supporting versatile applications through intelligent design.

Abstract: Metamaterials, known for their ability to manipulate light at subwavelength scales, face significant design challenges due to their complex and sophisticated structures. Consequently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to streamline their design process. Reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials (RMMs) with adjustable parameters can switch their optical characteristics between different states upon external stimulation, leading to numerous applications. However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM). By performing contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectrum, a well-trained spectrum encoder capable of understanding the spectrum is obtained, and it subsequently interacts with a pretrained LLM. This approach allows the model to preserve its linguistic capabilities while also comprehending Maxwell's Equations, enabling it to describe material structures with target optical properties in natural language. Our experiments demonstrate that CoSP can design corresponding thin-film metamaterial structures for arbitrary multi-state, multi-band optical responses, showing great potentials in the intelligent design of RMMs for versatile applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses controller synthesis for systems with safety-critical specifications expressed in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL), introducing a new framework and algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for ensuring safety in probabilistic systems often restrict temporal specifications to probabilistic avoidance constraints, preventing more expressive safety formulations. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by supporting general temporal properties through PCTL.

Method: The paper proposes CPCTL fragment for safe-PCTL specifications, reduces global specification satisfaction to local constraints, and introduces a Value Iteration-based algorithm to solve the synthesis problem for general PCTL temporal properties.

Result: The authors successfully demonstrate a theoretical framework for safe temporal property synthesis, and validate their Value Iteration-based algorithm's soundness and completeness.

Conclusion: The study establishes a novel synthesis method for more expressive safety specifications in probabilistic systems using safe-PCTL and provides a significant theoretical and practical contribution.

Abstract: Ensuring that agents satisfy safety specifications can be crucial in safety-critical environments. While methods exist for controller synthesis with safe temporal specifications, most existing methods restrict safe temporal specifications to probabilistic-avoidance constraints. Formal methods typically offer more expressive ways to express safety in probabilistic systems, such as Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) formulas. Thus, in this paper, we develop a new approach that supports more general temporal properties expressed in PCTL. Our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a theoretical framework for the Synthesis of safe-PCTL specifications. We show how the reducing global specification satisfaction to local constraints, and define CPCTL, a fragment of safe-PCTL. We demonstrate how the expressiveness of CPCTL makes it a relevant fragment for the Synthesis Problem.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency in implementing symmetry breaking in combinatorial solving by proposing a new method using auxiliary variables, leading to significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring correctness in symmetry breaking for combinatorial solving is challenging, and the existing general approach struggles with scalability due to big integer encoding.

Method: The authors propose encoding lexicographic orders with auxiliary variables instead of big integers, and test this innovation using SAT-based symmetry breakers and proof checking tools.

Result: Experiments demonstrate substantial speed-ups both theoretically and practically, improving proof logging and checking efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances proof-checking and symmetry-breaking efficiency, presenting a scalable solution for this combinatorial problem.

Abstract: Symmetry breaking is a crucial technique in modern combinatorial solving, but it is difficult to be sure it is implemented correctly. The most successful approach to deal with bugs is to make solvers certifying, so that they output not just a solution, but also a mathematical proof of correctness in a standard format, which can then be checked by a formally verified checker. This requires justifying symmetry reasoning within the proof, but developing efficient methods for this has remained a long-standing open challenge. A fully general approach was recently proposed by Bogaerts et al. (2023), but it relies on encoding lexicographic orders with big integers, which quickly becomes infeasible for large symmetries. In this work, we develop a method for instead encoding orders with auxiliary variables. We show that this leads to orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in both theory and practice by running experiments on proof logging and checking for SAT symmetry breaking using the state-of-the-art satsuma symmetry breaker and the VeriPB proof checking toolchain.

TL;DR: This paper creates a computational method combining machine learning and algebraic techniques to classify Galois groups of degree-7 polynomials, providing an efficient framework with a large annotated database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to classify Galois groups of irreducible degree-7 polynomials and improve classification accuracy, especially for rare solvable groups, using a hybrid machine learning and algebraic approach.

Method: The approach involves constructing a database of over one million projective septics annotated with algebraic invariants, computing resolvent factorizations to determine Galois groups, and training a neurosymbolic classifier based on invariant-theoretic features.

Result: The method achieves improved classification accuracy for rare solvable Galois groups and provides a reproducible database that aids constructive Galois theory and group distribution analysis.

Conclusion: This methodology shows the potential of combining symbolic and numeric approaches for tackling complex problems in computational algebra, with implications for broader applications in higher-degree polynomial classification.

Abstract: We develop a computational framework for classifying Galois groups of irreducible degree-7 polynomials over~$\mathbb{Q}$, combining explicit resolvent methods with machine learning techniques. A database of over one million normalized projective septics is constructed, each annotated with algebraic invariants~$J_0, \dots, J_4$ derived from binary transvections. For each polynomial, we compute resolvent factorizations to determine its Galois group among the seven transitive subgroups of~$S_7$ identified by Foulkes. Using this dataset, we train a neurosymbolic classifier that integrates invariant-theoretic features with supervised learning, yielding improved accuracy in detecting rare solvable groups compared to coefficient-based models. The resulting database provides a reproducible resource for constructive Galois theory and supports empirical investigations into group distribution under height constraints. The methodology extends to higher-degree cases and illustrates the utility of hybrid symbolic-numeric techniques in computational algebra.

Conclusion: Physics-informed sparse sensing with AI technology offers a low-cost, accurate approach to pipeline monitoring, addressing challenges in aging urban infrastructure.

Abstract: Underground pipeline leaks and infiltrations pose significant threats to water security and environmental safety. Traditional manual inspection methods provide limited coverage and delayed response, often missing critical anomalies. This paper proposes AquaSentinel, a novel physics-informed AI system for real-time anomaly detection in urban underground water pipeline networks. We introduce four key innovations: (1) strategic sparse sensor deployment at high-centrality nodes combined with physics-based state augmentation to achieve network-wide observability from minimal infrastructure; (2) the RTCA (Real-Time Cumulative Anomaly) detection algorithm, which employs dual-threshold monitoring with adaptive statistics to distinguish transient fluctuations from genuine anomalies; (3) a Mixture of Experts (MoE) ensemble of spatiotemporal graph neural networks that provides robust predictions by dynamically weighting model contributions; (4) causal flow-based leak localization that traces anomalies upstream to identify source nodes and affected pipe segments. Our system strategically deploys sensors at critical network junctions and leverages physics-based modeling to propagate measurements to unmonitored nodes, creating virtual sensors that enhance data availability across the entire network. Experimental evaluation using 110 leak scenarios demonstrates that AquaSentinel achieves 100% detection accuracy. This work advances pipeline monitoring by demonstrating that physics-informed sparse sensing can match the performance of dense deployments at a fraction of the cost, providing a practical solution for aging urban infrastructure.

Conclusion: The integration of volatile and non-volatile memristors in RC networks demonstrates their viability for precision computing tasks and diverse applications.

Abstract: In this study, we design a reservoir computing (RC) network by exploiting short- and long-term memory dynamics in Au/Ti/MoS$_2$/Au memristive devices. The temporal dynamics is engineered by controlling the thickness of the Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) MoS$_2$ films. Devices with a monolayer (1L)-MoS$_2$ film exhibit volatile (short-term memory) switching dynamics. We also report non-volatile resistance switching with excellent uniformity and analog behavior in conductance tuning for the multilayer (ML) MoS$_2$ memristive devices. We correlate this performance with trap-assisted space-charge limited conduction (SCLC) mechanism, leading to a bulk-limited resistance switching behavior. Four-bit reservoir states are generated using volatile memristors. The readout layer is implemented with an array of nonvolatile synapses. This small RC network achieves 89.56\% precision in a spoken-digit recognition task and is also used to analyze a nonlinear time series equation.

Motivation: Advance nuclear fusion energy by addressing the computational challenges in accurately simulating stellarator plasmas, especially considering non-axisymmetric geometries and particle species dynamics.

Method: Implemented a globally coupled projection scheme using hybrid fluid-kinetic models, a unified linear system encompassing toroidal harmonics, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for matrix acceleration, and a 3D R-Tree spatial index for particle localization.

Result: The framework was tested on realistic Wendelstein 7-X geometries, achieving spectral convergence and outperforming uncoupled approaches.

Conclusion: The validated computational tool provides high-fidelity predictive analysis capabilities crucial for optimizing next-generation stellarator designs.

Abstract: Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.
  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.
  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.
  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.

Result: Posture monitoring and fatigue prediction emerge as highly valuable and feasible use-cases, aligning with Industry 5.0 principles and suitable for semi-digital workplaces.

Conclusion: The study provides a decision-support framework for selecting impactful HDT applications and emphasizes the need for simulation-based validation and pilot deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Although Digital Twin is actively deployed in manufacturing, its human-centric counterpart - Human Digital Twin (HDT) is understudied, especially in job-shop production with high task variability and manual labor. HDT applications like ergonomic posture monitoring, fatigue prediction and health-based task assignment offer benefits to industries in emerging economies. However, poor digital maturity, lack of awareness and doubts about use-case applicability hinder adoption. This study provides a strategic prioritization framework to aid human-centric digital evolution in labor-intensive industries for guiding the selection of HDT applications delivering the highest value with the lowest implementation threshold. An integrated Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS approach evaluates the use-cases based on criteria like implementation cost, technological maturity, scalability. These criteria and use-cases were identified based on input from a five-member expert panel and verified for consistency (CR < 0.1). Analysis shows posture monitoring and fatigue prediction as most influential and practicable, especially in semi-digital environments. Strengths include compliance with Industry 5.0 principles incorporating technology and human factors. Lack of field validation and subjective knowledge pose drawbacks. Future work should include simulation-based validation and pilot tests on real job-shop settings. Ultimately, the research offers a decision-support system helping industries balance innovativeness and practicability in early stage of HDT adoption.

### [351] [An Exterior-Embedding Neural Operator Framework for Preserving Conservation Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16573)
*Huanshuo Dong,Hong Wang,Hao Wu,Zhiwei Zhuang,Xuanze Yang,Ruiqi Shu,Yuan Gao,Xiaomeng Huang*

Main category: cs.OH

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Exterior-Embedded Conservation Framework (ECF), a universal conservation-enforcing framework for neural operators, to improve their performance and ensure compliance with conservation laws in partial differential equations (PDEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify that current neural operators for solving PDEs fail to maintain conservation laws (e.g., mass, energy) and are sensitive to problem-specific architecture designs. This undermines their performance and generalizability.

Method: The paper proposes a universal Exterior-Embedded Conservation Framework (ECF) comprising two components: a conservation quantity encoder (extracts conserved attributes) and a conservation quantity decoder (adjusts predictions to ensure conservation compliance).

Result: Experimental validation across various PDE scenarios (e.g., adiabatic systems, shallow water equations, Allen-Cahn problem) shows that ECF enhances model accuracy and enforces strict compliance with conservation laws.

Conclusion: ECF offers a generalized solution to enforce strict conservation laws in neural operator predictions while improving accuracy and adaptability across diverse applications, advancing PDE resolution.

Abstract: Neural operators have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in accelerating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning governing physical laws from data. However, for PDEs governed by conservation laws(e.g., conservation of mass, energy, or matter), existing neural operators fail to satisfy conservation properties, which leads to degraded model performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, we observe that distinct PDE problems generally require different optimal neural network architectures. This finding underscores the inherent limitations of specialized models in generalizing across diverse problem domains.
  To address these limitations, we propose Exterior-Embedded Conservation Framework (ECF), a universal conserving framework that can be integrated with various data-driven neural operators to enforce conservation laws strictly in predictions. The framework consists of two key components: a conservation quantity encoder that extracts conserved quantities from input data, and a conservation quantity decoder that adjusts the neural operator's predictions using these quantities to ensure strict conservation compliance in the final output. Since our architecture enforces conservation laws, we theoretically prove that it enhances model performance. To validate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on multiple conservation-law-constrained PDE scenarios, including adiabatic systems, shallow water equations, and the Allen-Cahn problem. These baselines demonstrate that our method effectively improves model accuracy while strictly enforcing conservation laws in the predictions.

Result: The proposed neuromorphic architecture reduces resource utilization on hardware while enabling on-chip learning and adaptation to new control scenarios.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of the proposed architecture to design compact, resource-efficient neuromorphic devices for scalable reinforcement learning and better control adaptability.

Abstract: Application of neuromorphic edge devices for control is limited by the constraints on gradient-free online learning and scalability of the hardware across control problems. This paper introduces a synaptic Q-learning algorithm for the control of the classical Cartpole, where the Bellman equations are incorporated at the synaptic level. This formulation enables the iterative evolution of the network topology, represented as a directed graph, throughout the training process. This is followed by a similar approach called neuromorphic Bellman Memory Units (BMU(s)), which are implemented with the Neural Engineering Framework on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip. Topology evolution, in conjunction with mixed-signal computation, leverages the optimization of the number of neurons and synapses that could be used to design spike-based reinforcement learning accelerators. The proposed architecture can potentially reduce resource utilization on board, aiding the manufacturing of compact application-specific neuromorphic ICs. Moreover, the on-chip learning introduced in this work and implemented on a neuromorphic chip can enable adaptation to unseen control scenarios.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore the potential of QNNs in approximating periodic functions, inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks.

Method: It employs the Jackson inequality to approximate periodic functions efficiently through trigonometric polynomial representation and leverages QNNs with optimized parameters.

Result: A quadratic reduction in the required trainable parameters is achieved for periodic functions, with smoother functions requiring even fewer parameters.

Conclusion: QNNs exhibit enhanced efficiency for approximating periodic functions when carefully optimized, advancing quantum neural network research.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.

Result: The proposed GNN-optimized framework improves total key rate (27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), reduces average QBER (6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with minimal impact on average transmission distance (7.13 km to 6.42 km). It also enhances performance for networks of varying scales and demonstrates successful link prediction and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: This work shifts the paradigm of QKD network operation, making it more adaptive, scalable, and efficient for advanced quantum communication systems while ensuring robust security.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces SURF, a method to validate generative models used for jet tagging in particle physics, determining their performance limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the upper performance limits of jet tagging algorithms and improve generative models for accurate measurement and search sensitivity.

Method: The SURF framework trains a surrogate model on real data and a target model on samples from the surrogate, enabling exact Neyman-Pearson tests for validation.

Result: The study finds modern jet taggers are near their statistical limits when validated using EPiC-FM generative models, but GPT models exaggerate separation power misleading fundamental limits.

Conclusion: SURF provides a reliable framework to assess generative models, revealing that EPiC-FM is valid but GPT-based models misrepresent jet tagging limits.

Abstract: Beyond the practical goal of improving search and measurement sensitivity through better jet tagging algorithms, there is a deeper question: what are their upper performance limits? Generative surrogate models with learned likelihood functions offer a new approach to this problem, provided the surrogate correctly captures the underlying data distribution. In this work, we introduce the SUrrogate ReFerence (SURF) method, a new approach to validating generative models. This framework enables exact Neyman-Pearson tests by training the target model on samples from another tractable surrogate, which is itself trained on real data. We argue that the EPiC-FM generative model is a valid surrogate reference for JetClass jets and apply SURF to show that modern jet taggers may already be operating close to the true statistical limit. By contrast, we find that autoregressive GPT models unphysically exaggerate top vs. QCD separation power encoded in the surrogate reference, implying that they are giving a misleading picture of the fundamental limit.

TL;DR: This paper advances multidimensional scaling by extending h-plot methodology to analyze three-way proximity data, supporting symmetric and asymmetric frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods inadequately address three-way proximity data, especially in the context of asymmetric relationships.

Method: The researchers propose a technique leveraging embeddings in Euclidean space, eigenvector-based solutions, and computationally efficient processing for three-way proximity data.

Result: The extended h-plot approach offers intuitive visualization, efficiency, goodness-of-fit evaluation, and archetypal profile identification.

Conclusion: This work enhances understanding and analysis of three-way asymmetric proximities, demonstrates application in financial contexts, and provides reproducible resources.

Abstract: Multidimensional scaling visualizes dissimilarities among objects and reduces data dimensionality. While many methods address symmetric proximity data, asymmetric and especially three-way proximity data (capturing relationships across multiple occasions) remain underexplored. Recent developments, such as the h-plot, enable the analysis of asymmetric and non-reflexive relationships by embedding dissimilarities in a Euclidean space, allowing further techniques like archetypoid analysis to identify representative extreme profiles. However, no existing methods extract archetypal profiles from three-way asymmetric proximity data. This work extends the h-plot methodology to three-way proximity data under both symmetric and asymmetric, conditional and unconditional frameworks. The proposed approach offers several advantages: intuitive interpretability through a unified Euclidean representation; an explicit, eigenvector-based analytical solution free from local minima; scale invariance under linear transformations; computational efficiency for large matrices; and a straightforward goodness-of-fit evaluation. Furthermore, it enables the identification of archetypal profiles and clustering structures for three-way asymmetric proximities. Its performance is compared with existing models for multidimensional scaling and clustering, and illustrated through a financial application. All data and code are provided to facilitate reproducibility.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces cross-balancing, a method for causal inference that utilizes outcome data during study design, ensuring valid estimators and improved inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the longstanding challenge in causal inference of incorporating outcome data in constructing balanced groups for valid inference.

Method: The authors propose cross-balancing, which uses sample splitting to separate feature construction error from weight estimation error, applicable to both learned functions and variable selection.

Result: The method ensures consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient estimators, achieving bias reduction in learned functions and robustness in variable selection cases.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that cross-balancing can improve causal inference by carefully utilizing outcome information while retaining the interpretability of results.

Abstract: Causal inference starts with a simple idea: compare groups that differ by treatment, not much else. Traditionally, similar groups are constructed using only observed covariates; however, it remains a long-standing challenge to incorporate available outcome data into the study design while preserving valid inference. In this paper, we study the general problem of covariate adjustment, effect estimation, and statistical inference when balancing features are constructed or selected with the aid of outcome information from the data. We propose cross-balancing, a method that uses sample splitting to separate the error in feature construction from the error in weight estimation. Our framework addresses two cases: one where the features are learned functions and one where they are selected from a potentially high-dimensional dictionary. In both cases, we establish mild and general conditions under which cross-balancing produces consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient estimators. In the learned-function case, cross-balancing achieves finite-sample bias reduction relative to plug-in-type estimators, and is multiply robust when the learned features converge at slow rates. In the variable-selection case, cross-balancing only requires a product condition on how well the selected variables approximate true functions. We illustrate cross-balancing in extensive simulations and an observational study, showing that careful use of outcome information can substantially improve both estimation and inference while maintaining interpretability.

### [360] [Bayesian Semiparametric Causal Inference: Targeted Doubly Robust Estimation of Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15904)
*Gözde Sert,Abhishek Chakrabortty,Anirban Bhattacharya*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semiparametric Bayesian method to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) in high-dimensional observational data via debiasing and sample splitting, ensuring double robustness and frequentist validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust and efficient methods to estimate ATE using observational data with high-dimensional nuisance parameters, as conventional techniques struggle with bias and sensitivity.

Method: A Bayesian methodology was developed using debiasing with sample splitting and hierarchical learning. It incorporates summary statistics, double robustness, and Bernstein-von Mises theorem for posterior consistency.

Result: The method achieves asymptotic efficiency with accurate estimation, credible intervals, and double robustness under simulation, even in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: This approach offers a robust and efficient foundation for analyzing ATE and extends Bayesian semiparametric inference frameworks, applicable to broader causal inference estimands.

Abstract: We propose a semiparametric Bayesian methodology for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) within the potential outcomes framework using observational data with high-dimensional nuisance parameters. Our method introduces a Bayesian debiasing procedure that corrects for bias arising from nuisance estimation and employs a targeted modeling strategy based on summary statistics rather than the full data. These summary statistics are identified in a debiased manner, enabling the estimation of nuisance bias via weighted observables and facilitating hierarchical learning of the ATE. By combining debiasing with sample splitting, our approach separates nuisance estimation from inference on the target parameter, reducing sensitivity to nuisance model specification. We establish that, under mild conditions, the marginal posterior for the ATE satisfies a Bernstein-von Mises theorem when both nuisance models are correctly specified and remains consistent and robust when only one is correct, achieving Bayesian double robustness. This ensures asymptotic efficiency and frequentist validity. Extensive simulations confirm the theoretical results, demonstrating accurate point estimation and credible intervals with nominal coverage, even in high-dimensional settings. The proposed framework can also be extended to other causal estimands, and its key principles offer a general foundation for advancing Bayesian semiparametric inference more broadly.

### [361] [Secure Autonomous Agent Payments: Verifying Authenticity and Intent in a Trustless Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15712)
*Vivek Acharya*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A blockchain-based framework is proposed to ensure secure and intent-verifiable AI-initiated financial transactions in decentralized environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring authenticity and verifying the true intent of AI-led financial transactions in decentralized systems where traditional human safeguards are removed.

Method: The framework utilizes blockchain, decentralized identity (DID), verifiable credentials, on-chain intent proofs, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and secure execution environments (TEE-based attestations) in a hybrid architecture.

Result: Qualitative analysis shows strong resistance against impersonation, unauthorized transactions, and misalignment of intent, while providing an immutable audit trail.

Conclusion: This study establishes a foundation for secure, trustworthy, and accountable AI-driven financial ecosystems through intent-aware autonomous agents.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly capable of initiating financial transactions on behalf of users or other agents. This evolution introduces a fundamental challenge: verifying both the authenticity of an autonomous agent and the true intent behind its transactions in a decentralized, trustless environment. Traditional payment systems assume human authorization, but autonomous, agent-led payments remove that safeguard. This paper presents a blockchain-based framework that cryptographically authenticates and verifies the intent of every AI-initiated transaction. The proposed system leverages decentralized identity (DID) standards and verifiable credentials to establish agent identities, on-chain intent proofs to record user authorization, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to preserve privacy while ensuring policy compliance. Additionally, secure execution environments (TEE-based attestations) guarantee the integrity of agent reasoning and execution. The hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture provides an immutable audit trail linking user intent to payment outcome. Through qualitative analysis, the framework demonstrates strong resistance to impersonation, unauthorized transactions, and misalignment of intent. This work lays the foundation for secure, auditable, and intent-aware autonomous economic agents, enabling a future of verifiable trust and accountability in AI-driven financial ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a secure platform, the Digital Agriculture Sandbox, enabling farmers and researchers to collaboratively analyze agricultural data while maintaining privacy to address global food challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers' reluctance to share data due to privacy concerns limits researchers' ability to utilize this data for addressing global food challenges.

Method: The paper introduces the Digital Agriculture Sandbox using federated learning, differential privacy, and data analysis methods to maintain data privacy while enabling collaboration.

Result: The system allows farmers to identify peers and researchers to analyze data without exposing sensitive information, fostering a secure data-sharing environment.

Conclusion: The platform bridges the gap between safeguarding farm data privacy and leveraging it to tackle critical agricultural and food challenges worldwide.

Abstract: Digital agriculture is transforming the way we grow food by utilizing technology to make farming more efficient, sustainable, and productive. This modern approach to agriculture generates a wealth of valuable data that could help address global food challenges, but farmers are hesitant to share it due to privacy concerns. This limits the extent to which researchers can learn from this data to inform improvements in farming. This paper presents the Digital Agriculture Sandbox, a secure online platform that solves this problem. The platform enables farmers (with limited technical resources) and researchers to collaborate on analyzing farm data without exposing private information. We employ specialized techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and data analysis methods to safeguard the data while maintaining its utility for research purposes. The system enables farmers to identify similar farmers in a simplified manner without needing extensive technical knowledge or access to computational resources. Similarly, it enables researchers to learn from the data and build helpful tools without the sensitive information ever leaving the farmer's system. This creates a safe space where farmers feel comfortable sharing data, allowing researchers to make important discoveries. Our platform helps bridge the gap between maintaining farm data privacy and utilizing that data to address critical food and farming challenges worldwide.

### [363] [The Shawshank Redemption of Embodied AI: Understanding and Benchmarking Indirect Environmental Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16347)
*Chunyang Li,Zifeng Kang,Junwei Zhang,Zhuo Ma,Anda Cheng,Xinghua Li,Jianfeng Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces indirect environmental jailbreak (IEJ), a novel method to compromise embodied AI using malicious prompts in the environment, and proposes automated frameworks and benchmarks to evaluate this attack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the underexplored area of potential safety concerns in embodied AI, particularly focusing on the vulnerability to indirect jailbreaks through environmental cues.

Method: The authors propose IEJ attacks and develop two frameworks: SHAWSHANK for generating such attacks and SHAWSHANK-FORGE for creating benchmarks (SHAWSHANK-BENCH) to evaluate them. The study involves testing these methods against multiple vision-language models.

Result: SHAWSHANK successfully compromises all six tested VLMs across nearly 4,000 task-scene combinations, outperforming existing techniques. Current defenses show limited effectiveness against this new attack vector.

Conclusion: The paper reveals a significant safety vulnerability in embodied AI, provides tools for systematic evaluation, and highlights the inadequacy of existing defenses, urging further research and mitigation.

Abstract: The adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in embodied AI agents, while being effective, brings safety concerns such as jailbreaking. Prior work have explored the possibility of directly jailbreaking the embodied agents through elaborated multi-modal prompts. However, no prior work has studied or even reported indirect jailbreaks in embodied AI, where a black-box attacker induces a jailbreak without issuing direct prompts to the embodied agent. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, indirect environmental jailbreak (IEJ), a novel attack to jailbreak embodied AI via indirect prompt injected into the environment, such as malicious instructions written on a wall. Our key insight is that embodied AI does not ''think twice'' about the instructions provided by the environment -- a blind trust that attackers can exploit to jailbreak the embodied agent. We further design and implement open-source prototypes of two fully-automated frameworks: SHAWSHANK, the first automatic attack generation framework for the proposed attack IEJ; and SHAWSHANK-FORGE, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for IEJ. Then, using SHAWSHANK-FORGE, we automatically construct SHAWSHANK-BENCH, the first benchmark for indirectly jailbreaking embodied agents. Together, our two frameworks and one benchmark answer the questions of what content can be used for malicious IEJ instructions, where they should be placed, and how IEJ can be systematically evaluated. Evaluation results show that SHAWSHANK outperforms eleven existing methods across 3,957 task-scene combinations and compromises all six tested VLMs. Furthermore, current defenses only partially mitigate our attack, and we have responsibly disclosed our findings to all affected VLM vendors.

*Huseein Jawad,Nicolas Brunel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the vulnerability of system prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extraction attacks and proposes a novel framework using shield appending to protect sensitive information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the security and privacy risks posed by adversarial attempts to extract hidden instructions from system prompts in LLMs, which often contain sensitive or proprietary information.

Method: The authors formalize prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. They employ an LLM-as-optimizer to create protective SHIELDs by minimizing leakage metrics from adversarial attacks while maintaining task utility and semantic fidelity.

Result: The optimized SHIELDs demonstrated reduced leakage against extraction attacks across multiple experimental settings, outperforming baseline defenses and maintaining the functionality of the model.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a lightweight, practical defense mechanism for system prompt protection in LLMs, reinforcing security and preserving utility in models accessible via black-box APIs.

Abstract: System prompts are critical for guiding the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they often contain proprietary logic or sensitive information, making them a prime target for extraction attacks. Adversarial queries can successfully elicit these hidden instructions, posing significant security and privacy risks. Existing defense mechanisms frequently rely on heuristics, incur substantial computational overhead, or are inapplicable to models accessed via black-box APIs. This paper introduces a novel framework for hardening system prompts through shield appending, a lightweight approach that adds a protective textual layer to the original prompt. Our core contribution is the formalization of prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. We leverage an LLM-as-optimizer to search the space of possible SHIELDs, seeking to minimize a leakage metric derived from a suite of adversarial attacks, while simultaneously preserving task utility above a specified threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs. This black-box, optimization-driven methodology is lightweight and practical, requiring only API access to the target and optimizer LLMs. We demonstrate empirically that our optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against a comprehensive set of extraction attacks, outperforming established baseline defenses without compromising the model's intended functionality. Our work presents a paradigm for developing robust, utility-aware defenses in the escalating landscape of LLM security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks pose critical risks to RAG systems, making it essential to develop methods for evaluating and mitigating these vulnerabilities.

Method: The paper creates a benchmark with 847 adversarial test cases across five attack categories, evaluates three defense mechanisms, and assesses them on seven language models.

Result: The study's multi-layered framework reduces attack success rates from 73.2% to 8.7% while preserving 94.3% baseline task performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark and defense framework significantly enhance AI agent security, offering resources to support future research in safeguarding RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have become widely used for enhancing large language model capabilities, but they introduce significant security vulnerabilities through prompt injection attacks. We present a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating prompt injection risks in RAG-enabled AI agents and propose a multi-layered defense framework. Our benchmark includes 847 adversarial test cases across five attack categories: direct injection, context manipulation, instruction override, data exfiltration, and cross-context contamination. We evaluate three defense mechanisms: content filtering with embedding-based anomaly detection, hierarchical system prompt guardrails, and multi-stage response verification, across seven state-of-the-art language models. Our combined framework reduces successful attack rates from 73.2% to 8.7% while maintaining 94.3% of baseline task performance. We release our benchmark dataset and defense implementation to support future research in AI agent security.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel command & control (C2) architecture using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance autonomous red teaming in cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI in offensive cybersecurity faces challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns despite its potential to revolutionize penetration tests.

Method: The MCP-based C2 architecture coordinates distributed reconnaissance agents asynchronously across networks, improving system behavior while reducing detection artifacts.

Result: Experiments show MCP drastically reduces manual effort and detection footprint in comparison to traditional C2 systems.

Conclusion: This framework advances AI-driven red teaming capabilities and informs defensive strategies, while addressing ethical implications and proposing controlled evaluation methods.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping offensive cybersecurity by enabling autonomous red team agents that can plan, execute, and adapt during penetration tests. However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores criminal activity within Monero by leveraging a graph-based methodology to identify patterns and train Machine Learning models, aiding investigative procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Criminal actors increasingly use Monero for its privacy features to conceal illicit transactions, making it essential to develop tools to analyze their activities within this ecosystem.

Method: A graph-based methodology is applied to flagged Monero transactions, constructing Address-Ring-Transaction graphs. Structural and temporal features are extracted and fed into Machine Learning models to detect criminal patterns.

Result: The study demonstrates how Machine Learning models can identify behavioral patterns in Monero transactions, contributing to investigative tools targeting privacy-focused blockchain networks.

Conclusion: This work signifies an early step toward creating analytical tools for monitoring and detecting illicit activity in privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies like Monero.

Abstract: As Law Enforcement Agencies advance in cryptocurrency forensics, criminal actors aiming to conceal illicit fund movements increasingly turn to "mixin" services or privacy-based cryptocurrencies. Monero stands out as a leading choice due to its strong privacy preserving and untraceability properties, making conventional blockchain analysis ineffective. Understanding the behavior and operational patterns of criminal actors within Monero is therefore challenging and it is essential to support future investigative strategies and disrupt illicit activities. In this work, we propose a case study in which we leverage a novel graph-based methodology to extract structural and temporal patterns from Monero transactions linked to already discovered criminal activities. By building Address-Ring-Transaction graphs from flagged transactions, we extract structural and temporal features and use them to train Machine Learning models capable of detecting similar behavioral patterns that could highlight criminal modus operandi. This represents a first partial step toward developing analytical tools that support investigative efforts in privacy-preserving blockchain ecosystems

### [368] [Future-Back Threat Modeling: A Foresight-Driven Security Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16088)
*Vu Van Than*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM), a methodology to predict and address future cyber threats by focusing on anticipated future states rather than past incidents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing threat models overly rely on historical incident data and known techniques, failing to address emerging and future threats such as AI and supply chain attacks.

Method: The Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM) approach works backward from envisioned future threat scenarios to identify current defense gaps and vulnerabilities.

Result: FBTM enhances the ability to predict emerging, plausible threats and unknown cybersecurity vulnerabilities, particularly in uncertain future scenarios.

Conclusion: By using FBTM, organizations can proactively address future threats, reduce vulnerabilities, and implement decisions today that foster a more robust cybersecurity posture.

Abstract: Traditional threat modeling remains reactive-focused on known TTPs and past incident data, while threat prediction and forecasting frameworks are often disconnected from operational or architectural artifacts. This creates a fundamental weakness: the most serious cyber threats often do not arise from what is known, but from what is assumed, overlooked, or not yet conceived, and frequently originate from the future, such as artificial intelligence, information warfare, and supply chain attacks, where adversaries continuously develop new exploits that can bypass defenses built on current knowledge. To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible. This enhances the predictability of adversary behavior, particularly under future uncertainty, helping security leaders make informed decisions today that shape more resilient security postures for the future.

*Wei Zhao,Zhe Li,Yige Li,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-MLLM, an architecture utilizing vector quantization to enhance multimodal models' defense against adversarial attacks by discretizing visual inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite robust text-based safety mechanisms, MLLMs face vulnerabilities in visual input attacks due to continuous visual representations and inadequate alignment of text-based safeguards with visual data.

Method: Q-MLLM employs two-level vector quantization to discretize visual inputs at pixel-patch and semantic levels, coupled with a two-stage training approach for robust learning and cross-modal safety.

Result: Q-MLLM achieves a 100% defense success rate against most jailbreak attacks and outperforms existing approaches in handling toxic image attacks, while maintaining strong multimodal reasoning capabilities and minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Vector quantization is proven to be a cost-efficient and effective defense mechanism for multimodal AI, ensuring security without compromising performance or requiring extensive fine-tuning or detection resources.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in cross-modal understanding, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs despite robust textual safety mechanisms. These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Game-Theory Attack (GTA), a scalable black-box jailbreak framework targeting safety-aligned LLMs to achieve high attack success rates (ASR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of heuristic, narrow-scaled black-box jailbreak attacks and explore scalable, game-theory-inspired methods for bypassing safety constraints in LLMs.

Method: The paper formalizes jailbreak attacks as a finite-horizon stochastic game, introduces a 'template-over-safety flip' behavioral conjecture, and employs an adaptive Attacker Agent to apply pressure via game-theoretic strategies.

Result: GTA achieves over 95% ASR on various LLMs, demonstrates strong generalization, works in multilingual settings, handles detection avoidance, and effectively jailbreaks real-world LLM applications.

Conclusion: GTA is a highly effective, scalable, and generalizable framework for jailbreaking safety-aligned LLMs, capable of defeating detection mechanisms and exposing critical safety vulnerabilities in existing LLM applications.

Abstract: As LLMs become more common, non-expert users can pose risks, prompting extensive research into jailbreak attacks. However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture "template-over-safety flip": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage artificial intelligence for transforming food systems, enhancing innovation, sustainability, and health outcomes.

Method: Insights synthesized through discussions from the AI for Food Product Development Symposium focusing on supply chain, formulation, processing, consumer insights, nutrition, and education.

Result: The symposium highlighted the need for interoperable data standards, transparent models, cross-sector collaboration, robust digital infrastructure, and interdisciplinary training.

Conclusion: A roadmap was proposed for integrating AI responsibly into food manufacturing to ensure ethical innovation, sustainability, and societal benefit.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is accelerating a new era of food innovation, connecting data from farm to consumer to improve formulation, processing, and health outcomes. Recent advances in deep learning, natural language processing, and multi-omics integration make it possible to understand and optimize food systems with unprecedented depth. However, AI adoption across the food sector remains uneven due to heterogeneous datasets, limited model and system interoperability, and a persistent skills gap between data scientists and food domain experts. To address these challenges and advance responsible innovation, the AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS) convened the inaugural AI for Food Product Development Symposium at University of California, Davis, in October 2025. This white paper synthesizes insights from the symposium, organized around five domains where AI can have the greatest near-term impact: supply chain; formulation and processing; consumer insights and sensory prediction; nutrition and health; and education and workforce development. Across the areas, participants emphasized the importance of interoperable data standards, transparent and interpretable models, and cross-sector collaboration to accelerate the translation of AI research into practice. The discussions further highlighted the need for robust digital infrastructure, privacy-preserving data-sharing mechanisms, and interdisciplinary training pathways that integrate AI literacy with domain expertise. Collectively, the priorities outline a roadmap for integrating AI into food manufacturing in ways that enhance innovation, sustainability, and human well-being while ensuring that technological progress remains grounded in ethics, scientific rigor, and societal benefit.

TL;DR: The study systematically reviews six AI chat systems on their responses to conspiracy theories, noting selective safety measures based on models and topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the limitations and risks of generative AI chat systems in addressing conspiracy theories.

Method: Used a platform policy implementation audit method and analyzed AI chatbot responses to five debunked and four emerging conspiracy theories.

Result: Findings reveal inconsistent safety guardrails between chatbots, selectively designed safety mechanisms, focusing heavily on racism and topics of national trauma.

Conclusion: Selective design of safety measures can cause inconsistencies and bias in generative AI systems, warranting extended study across platforms, languages, and diverse conspiracy topics.

Abstract: Interactive chat systems that build on artificial intelligence frameworks are increasingly ubiquitous and embedded into search engines, Web browsers, and operating systems, or are available on websites and apps. Researcher efforts have sought to understand the limitations and potential for harm of generative AI, which we contribute to here. Conducting a systematic review of six AI-powered chat systems (ChatGPT 3.5; ChatGPT 4 Mini; Microsoft Copilot in Bing; Google Search AI; Perplexity; and Grok in Twitter/X), this study examines how these leading products respond to questions related to conspiracy theories. This follows the platform policy implementation audit approach established by Glazunova et al. (2023). We select five well-known and comprehensively debunked conspiracy theories and four emerging conspiracy theories that relate to breaking news events at the time of data collection. Our findings demonstrate that the extent of safety guardrails against conspiratorial ideation in generative AI chatbots differs markedly, depending on chatbot model and conspiracy theory. Our observations indicate that safety guardrails in AI chatbots are often very selectively designed: generative AI companies appear to focus especially on ensuring that their products are not seen to be racist; they also appear to pay particular attention to conspiracy theories that address topics of substantial national trauma such as 9/11 or relate to well-established political issues. Future work should include an ongoing effort extended to further platforms, multiple languages, and a range of conspiracy theories extending well beyond the United States.

*Shalabh Kumar Singh,Shubhashis Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper discusses the challenges of achieving sovereign AI in a globally interconnected system and proposes a framework to assess and balance autonomy with interdependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to address dilemmas of sovereignty in the rapidly evolving field of AI, as governments aim to maintain control amidst interconnected global data pipelines, supply chains, and open-source ecosystems.

Method: The authors propose a planner's model to analyze sovereignty in AI, introducing policy heuristics and applying the model to case studies in India and the Middle East.

Result: The model identifies India's challenges in Model autonomy and proposes strategies like data-compute investment integration, while in the Middle East, it highlights strong public investment in Arabic-first models with effective guardrails for openness.

Conclusion: Achieving sovereign AI requires managed interdependence, balancing openness and autonomy, rather than complete isolation, making it adaptable to different geopolitical and economic scenarios.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a foundational general-purpose technology, raising new dilemmas of sovereignty in an interconnected world. While governments seek greater control over it, the very foundations of AI--global data pipelines, semiconductor supply chains, open-source ecosystems, and international standards--resist enclosure. This paper develops a conceptual and formal framework for understanding sovereign AI as a continuum rather than a binary condition, balancing autonomy with interdependence. Drawing on classical theories, historical analogies, and contemporary debates on networked autonomy, we present a planner's model that identifies two policy heuristics: equalizing marginal returns across the four sovereignty pillars and setting openness where global benefits equal exposure risks.
  We apply the model to India, highlighting sovereign footholds in data, compute, and norms but weaker model autonomy. The near-term challenge is integration via coupled Data x Compute investment, lifecycle governance (ModelOps), and safeguarded procurement. We then apply the model to the Middle East (Saudi Arabia and the UAE), where large public investment in Arabic-first models and sovereign cloud implies high sovereignty weights, lower effective fiscal constraints, and strong Data x Compute complementarities. An interior openness setting with guardrails emerges as optimal. Across contexts, the lesson is that sovereignty in AI needs managed interdependence, not isolation.

Motivation: To address the urgent need for teaching students to engage critically and reflectively with AI tools in higher education, as these tools become increasingly integrated into academic settings.

Method: A graduate-level academic writing activity over eight weeks, involving literature review projects with multiple revision stages. Students received feedback from both a custom-built AI reviewer and human peers, with data collected from writing artifacts, feedback logs, and reflections.

Result: Students utilized AI feedback for surface-level edits and rubric alignment, while peer feedback was used for deep conceptual development. Their relationship with AI evolved, showing growing confidence, strategic use, and critical awareness of its limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed design effectively developed students' writing skills, AI literacy, and disciplinary understanding, offering a scalable model for integrating AI into higher education writing practices.

Abstract: The growing integration of generative AI in higher education is transforming how students write, learn, and engage with knowledge. As AI tools become more integrated into classrooms, there is an urgent need for pedagogical approaches that help students use them critically and reflectively. This study proposes a pedagogical design that integrates AI and peer feedback in a graduate-level academic writing activity. Over eight weeks, students developed literature review projects through multiple writing and revision stages, receiving feedback from both a custom-built AI reviewer and human peers. We examine two questions: (1) How did students interact with and incorporate AI and peer feedback during the writing process? and (2) How did they reflect on and build relationships with both human and AI reviewers? Data sources include student writing artifacts, AI and peer feedback, AI chat logs, and student reflections. Findings show that students engaged differently with each feedback source-relying on AI for rubric alignment and surface-level edits, and on peer feedback for conceptual development and disciplinary relevance. Reflections revealed evolving relationships with AI, characterized by increasing confidence, strategic use, and critical awareness of its limitations. The pedagogical design supported writing development, AI literacy, and disciplinary understanding. This study offers a scalable pedagogical model for integrating AI into writing instruction and contributes insights for system-level approaches to fostering meaningful human-AI collaboration in higher education.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) challenge traditional organizational knowing and epistemological foundations, acting as hybrid entities disrupting established categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to examine the transformative impact of LLMs on organizational epistemologies and analogizing as a key knowledge process.

Method: The authors analyze LLMs' capabilities through statistical inference, focusing on analogies (surface/deep and near/far domains) and their operational risks.

Result: The paper identifies challenges posed by LLMs: reshaping inquiry, emphasizing dialogical vetting, and redistributing agency.

Conclusion: It highlights the implications of knowing-with-LLMs, urging organizational theory to move beyond human-centered perspectives and adapt to intelligent technologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping organizational knowing by unsettling the epistemological foundations of representational and practice-based perspectives. We conceptualize LLMs as Haraway-ian monsters, that is, hybrid, boundary-crossing entities that destabilize established categories while opening new possibilities for inquiry. Focusing on analogizing as a fundamental driver of knowledge, we examine how LLMs generate connections through large-scale statistical inference. Analyzing their operation across the dimensions of surface/deep analogies and near/far domains, we highlight both their capacity to expand organizational knowing and the epistemic risks they introduce. Building on this, we identify three challenges of living with such epistemic monsters: the transformation of inquiry, the growing need for dialogical vetting, and the redistribution of agency. By foregrounding the entangled dynamics of knowing-with-LLMs, the paper extends organizational theory beyond human-centered epistemologies and invites renewed attention to how knowledge is created, validated, and acted upon in the age of intelligent technologies.

### [376] [The Loss of Control Playbook: Degrees, Dynamics, and Preparedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15846)
*Charlotte Stix,Annika Hallensleben,Alejandro Ortega,Matteo Pistillo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of a clear definition for Loss of Control (LoC) in AI systems, proposes a taxonomy to categorize LoC, and outlines a preparedness and governance framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no actionable definition for Loss of Control in AI systems, preventing effective assessment and mitigation, despite its importance being recognized increasingly in policy and research.

Method: The study proposes a graded taxonomy for LoC (Deviation, Bounded LoC, Strict LoC) based on severity and persistence metrics, supported by a societal vulnerability modeling framework. It introduces the DAP framework emphasizing extrinsic factors (Deployment context, Affordances, Permissions) and suggests approaches to maintain preparedness.

Result: A new taxonomy for LoC and preparedness framework is developed, along with strategies for governance and technical controls to prevent societal states of vulnerability due to AI systems.

Conclusion: If absent strategic interventions, societal vulnerability to LoC outcomes in AI systems may increase over time, but actionable measures outlined (DAP framework, governance policies) can mitigate risks and ensure prolonged prevention of LoC.

Abstract: This research report addresses the absence of an actionable definition for Loss of Control (LoC) in AI systems by developing a novel taxonomy and preparedness framework. Despite increasing policy and research attention, existing LoC definitions vary significantly in scope and timeline, hindering effective LoC assessment and mitigation. To address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature review and propose a graded LoC taxonomy, based on the metrics of severity and persistence, that distinguishes between Deviation, Bounded LoC, and Strict LoC. We model pathways toward a societal state of vulnerability in which sufficiently advanced AI systems have acquired or could acquire the means to cause Bounded or Strict LoC once a catalyst, either misalignment or pure malfunction, materializes. We argue that this state becomes increasingly likely over time, absent strategic intervention, and propose a strategy to avoid reaching a state of vulnerability. Rather than focusing solely on intervening on AI capabilities and propensities potentially relevant for LoC or on preventing potential catalysts, we introduce a complementary framework that emphasizes three extrinsic factors: Deployment context, Affordances, and Permissions (the DAP framework). Compared to work on intrinsic factors and catalysts, this framework has the unfair advantage of being actionable today. Finally, we put forward a plan to maintain preparedness and prevent the occurrence of LoC outcomes should a state of societal vulnerability be reached, focusing on governance measures (threat modeling, deployment policies, emergency response) and technical controls (pre-deployment testing, control measures, monitoring) that could maintain a condition of perennial suspension.
