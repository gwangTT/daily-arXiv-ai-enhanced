### [1] [Clustering-based Transfer Learning for Dynamic Multimodal MultiObjective Evolutionary Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18947)
*Li Yan,Bolun Liu,Chao Li,Jing Liang,Kunjie Yu,Caitong Yue,Xuzhao Chai,Boyang Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark suite for dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization and proposes an algorithm utilizing clustering-based autoencoder prediction and adaptive niching strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of tracking equivalent pareto optimal sets and maintaining diversity in dynamic environments, which existing algorithms fail to address effectively.

Method: A novel algorithm employing a clustering-based autoencoder for generating diverse initial populations and an adaptive niching strategy integrated into the static optimizer for better diversity and convergence balance.

Result: Empirical evaluations on 12 test functions show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both population diversity and objective convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively advances dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization, addressing adaptability and diversity challenges.

Abstract: Dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization presents the dual challenge of simultaneously tracking multiple equivalent pareto optimal sets and maintaining population diversity in time-varying environments. However, existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often neglect solution modality, whereas static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes. To address above challenge, this paper makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space.

### [2] [Conflict-Driven Clause Learning with VSIDS Heuristics for Discrete Facility Layout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18034)
*Joshua Gibson,Kapil Dhakal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how CDCL with VSIDS heuristics can solve discrete facility layout problems better and explores hybrid approaches combining CDCL and CP-SAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational methods for solving the discrete facility layout problem while addressing scaling and optimization challenges.

Method: Develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility, compare CDCL with CP-SAT and MILP, and introduce hybrid frameworks combining CDCL with CP-SAT for optimization.

Result: CDCL outperforms CP-SAT and MILP in scalability for feasibility detection. Hybrid architectures enhance optimization speed while maintaining correctness.

Conclusion: CDCL is effective for feasibility resolution in large facility layout problems, and hybrid approaches can balance speed and optimality effectively.

Abstract: This paper studies the use of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) with VSIDS heuristics as a computational engine for discrete facility layout problems. The facility layout problem is modeled as a combinatorial assignment problem with dense logical structure arising from adjacency, separation, and slot-availability constraints. We develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility and compare CDCL-based SAT solving against CP-SAT and MILP formulations under a unified benchmarking framework. Empirical results show that CDCL exhibits near-constant runtime behavior for feasibility detection across increasing problem sizes and constraint densities, while CP-SAT and MILP display polynomial and exponential scaling respectively. To address the limitation of CDCL in objective optimization, we introduce two hybrid architectures that combine CDCL-based feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization. The first architecture rapidly enumerates feasible layouts to trade optimality for speed, while the second uses CDCL to generate warm-start solutions that accelerate exact optimization. The results demonstrate that hybrid approaches can significantly reduce time-to-solution while preserving correctness guarantees, clarifying the algorithmic trade-offs between clause-learning search and exact optimization methods in large-scale discrete layout problems.

### [3] [Faithful and Stable Neuron Explanations for Trustworthy Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18092)
*Ge Yan,Tuomas Oikarinen,Tsui-Wei,Weng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a theoretical analysis for neuron identification in machine learning by addressing faithfulness and stability, and introduces a method for trustworthy neuron identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuron identification lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation, which is essential to ensure trustworthy and reliable interpretability in deep networks.

Method: The paper reinterprets neuron identification as an inverse process of machine learning, derives generalization bounds for faithfulness and proposes a bootstrap-based ensemble method for stability, termed as the BE method, for concept prediction sets.

Result: Generalization bounds and a bootstrap ensemble procedure (BE) ensure faithfulness and quantify stability. Experiments on synthetic and real data validate the approach.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework and proposed method advance the reliability and trustworthiness of neuron identification in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Neuron identification is a popular tool in mechanistic interpretability, aiming to uncover the human-interpretable concepts represented by individual neurons in deep networks. While algorithms such as Network Dissection and CLIP-Dissect achieve great empirical success, a rigorous theoretical foundation remains absent, which is crucial to enable trustworthy and reliable explanations. In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification.

### [4] [Rethinking Multi-Agent Intelligence Through the Lens of Small-World Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18094)
*Boxuan Wang,Zhuoyun Li,Xiaowei Huang,Yi Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of small-world network connectivity as a design prior for multi-agent systems (MAS) with large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve communication topology in multi-agent systems based on large language models, addressing the limitations of current structural approaches.

Method: The study uses small-world (SW) network principles, bridging insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS. It tests this via multi-agent debate (MAD) setups and introduces an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scalability.

Result: Findings show that SW connectivity stabilizes consensus trajectories, maintains similar accuracy and token cost, and adapts to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity through a controllable rewiring scheme.

Conclusion: SW network priors offer significant benefits for MAS, enhancing robustness, scalability, reasoning stability, and introducing cognitive bias for emergent roles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) in which multiple agents argue, critique, and coordinate to solve complex tasks, making communication topology a first-class design choice. Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles.

### [5] [Efficient Mixture-of-Agents Serving via Tree-Structured Routing, Adaptive Pruning, and Dependency-Aware Prefill-Decode Overlap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18126)
*Zijun Wang,Yijiahao Qi,Hanqiu Chen,Zishen Wan,Gongjin Sun,Dongyang Li,Shuyi Pei,Cong Hao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an algorithm-system co-design to address inefficiencies in Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) inference, achieving up to 90% latency reduction with minimal accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce serving latency in MoA inference, which is hindered by dense inter-agent communication and low hardware utilization.

Method: The method includes replacing dense communication graphs with a hierarchical tree topology, using runtime adaptive mechanisms to skip unnecessary agent activations based on intermediate outputs, and pipelining agent execution.

Result: The proposed approach significantly cuts latency (up to 90%) while maintaining comparable accuracy (within ±1%), and even enhances accuracy in specific instances.

Conclusion: An efficient and effective design for MoA inference is introduced, demonstrating substantial improvements in latency and operational performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) inference can suffer from dense inter-agent communication and low hardware utilization, which jointly inflate serving latency. We present a serving design that targets these bottlenecks through an algorithm-system co-design. First, we replace dense agent interaction graphs with a hierarchical tree topology that induces structured sparsity in inter-agent communication. Second, we introduce a runtime adaptive mechanism that selectively terminates or skips downstream agent invocations using semantic agreement and confidence signals from intermediate outputs. Third, we pipeline agent execution by overlapping incremental prefilling with decoding across dependency-related agents, improving utilization and reducing inference latency. Across representative tasks, this approach substantially reduces end-to-end latency (up to 90%) while maintaining comparable accuracy (within $\pm$1%) relative to dense-connectivity MoA baselines, and can improve accuracy in certain settings.

### [6] [Unifying Causal Reinforcement Learning: Survey, Taxonomy, Algorithms and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18135)
*Cristiano da Costa Cunha,Wei Liu,Tim French,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper surveys the integration of causal inference in reinforcement learning to address limitations such as low explainability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle critical limitations in classical reinforcement learning, including its reliance on correlation-driven decision-making and challenges with distribution shifts and dynamic environments.

Method: The paper categorizes existing approaches to causal reinforcement learning and outlines advancements in areas like causal representation learning, counterfactual policy optimization, offline causal RL, transfer learning, and explainability.

Result: The work highlights empirical successes, identifies challenges, and presents open problems in causal reinforcement learning methodologies.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that causal reinforcement learning has significant potential for building advanced AI systems that are robust, generalizable, and interpretable.

Abstract: Integrating causal inference (CI) with reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address critical limitations in classical RL, including low explainability, lack of robustness and generalization failures. Traditional RL techniques, which typically rely on correlation-driven decision-making, struggle when faced with distribution shifts, confounding variables, and dynamic environments. Causal reinforcement learning (CRL), leveraging the foundational principles of causal inference, offers promising solutions to these challenges by explicitly modeling cause-and-effect relationships. In this survey, we systematically review recent advancements at the intersection of causal inference and RL. We categorize existing approaches into causal representation learning, counterfactual policy optimization, offline causal RL, causal transfer learning, and causal explainability. Through this structured analysis, we identify prevailing challenges, highlight empirical successes in practical applications, and discuss open problems. Finally, we provide future research directions, underscoring the potential of CRL for developing robust, generalizable, and interpretable artificial intelligence systems.

*Alex Wilf,Pranjal Aggarwal,Bryan Parno,Daniel Fried,Louis-Philippe Morency,Paul Pu Liang,Sean Welleck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces the PSV framework for training models in verified code generation using self-play, showing improved performance via formal verification signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstrate the viability of self-play for training large language models in tasks requiring reliable correctness signals, like verified code generation.

Method: The PSV framework leverages formal verification to train a problem proposer and a solver iteratively, improving verified code generation performance.

Result: PSV-Verus achieves significant improvements (up to 9.6x on benchmarks) in verified code generation tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Formal verification and difficulty-aware proposal are critical for self-play's success in training models for complex tasks like code generation.

Abstract: Training models through self-play alone (without any human data) has been a longstanding goal in AI, but its effectiveness for training large language models remains unclear, particularly in code generation where rewards based on unit tests are brittle and prone to error propagation. We study self-play in the verified code generation setting, where formal verification provides reliable correctness signals. We introduce Propose, Solve, Verify (PSV) a simple self-play framework where formal verification signals are used to create a proposer capable of generating challenging synthetic problems and a solver trained via expert iteration. We use PSV to train PSV-Verus, which across three benchmarks improves pass@1 by up to 9.6x over inference-only and expert-iteration baselines. We show that performance scales with the number of generated questions and training iterations, and through ablations identify formal verification and difficulty-aware proposal as essential ingredients for successful self-play.

### [8] [NEURO-GUARD: Neuro-Symbolic Generalization and Unbiased Adaptive Routing for Diagnostics -- Explainable Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18177)
*Midhat Urooj,Ayan Banerjee,Sandeep Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEURO-GUARD, an AI framework combining Vision Transformers (ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) for interpretable and robust medical image diagnosis, achieving improved accuracy and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in medical AI, such as limited data, subtle visual cues, high-stakes decisions, and poor interpretability and generalization of existing models.

Method: NEURO-GUARD integrates ViTs with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism driven by large language models. It uses clinical and expert knowledge for self-verification and improves feature detection and classification.

Result: NEURO-GUARD improved diabetic retinopathy classification accuracy by 6.2% over ViT-only baselines and demonstrated a 5% improvement in domain generalization. It also showed robust performance in MRI-based seizure detection.

Conclusion: NEURO-GUARD successfully combines symbolic reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, achieving interpretable and generalizable medical image diagnosis while delivering state-of-the-art results across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Accurate yet interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a central challenge in medical AI, particularly in settings characterized by limited data, subtle visual cues, and high-stakes clinical decision-making. Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods.
  Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.

### [9] [NL2CA: Auto-formalizing Cognitive Decision-Making from Natural Language Using an Unsupervised CriticNL2LTL Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18189)
*Zihao Deng,Yijia Li,Renrui Zhang,Peijun Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces NL2CA, a system that automates the creation of cognitive decision-making models from natural language descriptions without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the labor-intensive process of creating cognitive computing models for decision-making and to develop an automated approach for translating human experiences in natural language into formal cognitive frameworks.

Method: The proposed NL2CA method translates text into Linear Temporal Logic via a fine-tuned language model, refines the logic using an unsupervised Critic Tree, and converts it into production rules. These rules are then used to construct and optimize cognitive agents with reinforcement learning.

Result: The system was validated in two domains: NL-to-LTL translation, achieving robust performance without human feedback, and cognitive driving simulation, where agents replicated decision patterns across 70 trials in critical scenarios.

Conclusion: NL2CA demonstrates scalable and interpretable cognitive modeling, offering a breakthrough method for creating symbolic cognitive agents directly from textual data.

Abstract: Cognitive computing models offer a formal and interpretable way to characterize human's deliberation and decision-making, yet their development remains labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose NL2CA, a novel method for auto-formalizing cognitive decision-making rules from natural language descriptions of human experience. Different from most related work that exploits either pure manual or human guided interactive modeling, our method is fully automated without any human intervention. The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that NL2CA enables scalable, interpretable, and human-aligned cognitive modeling from unstructured textual data, offering a novel paradigm to automatically design symbolic cognitive agents.

### [10] [External Hippocampus: Topological Cognitive Maps for Guiding Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18190)
*Jian Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the External Hippocampus framework to enhance reasoning in small language models by modeling information flow in semantic spaces and utilizing cognitive maps for efficient navigation and intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cognitive deadlock issues and improve multi-step reasoning performance in small language models.

Method: The framework uses topological cognitive maps created via dimensionality reduction, guides reasoning through energy flow navigation, and employs temperature perturbations to resolve stagnation.

Result: Map-guided methods achieved an 81.20% accuracy (+16.80% improvement), reduced reasoning time by at least 15x, and highlighted phenomena like 'Cognitive Vortex' and low-entropy wells.

Conclusion: The framework offers efficient, autonomous, and controllable solutions for reasoning, especially suitable for small language models, without requiring additional training.

Abstract: This paper proposes the External Hippocampus framework, which models language model reasoning from a cognitive dynamics perspective as the flow of information energy in semantic space. Unlike traditional weight-space optimization methods, this framework constructs topological cognitive maps through dimensionality reduction projection, enabling precise navigation and intervention of energy flow at test time while avoiding substantial computational requirements and demonstrating predictable intervention patterns. The method effectively addresses the cognitive deadlock problem in multi-step reasoning for small models. Experiments on models <=7B parameters show: map-guided methods achieve 81.20% accuracy on 500 challenging problems (relative baseline +16.80%), reduce reasoning time by >= 15x, with key findings revealing that reasoning stagnation manifests as "Cognitive Vortex" and low-entropy potential wells, while temperature perturbations effectively restart energy flow. The framework requires no additional training, possesses autonomous growth capability, and provides an efficient and controllable topological-aware solution for small model reasoning.

### [11] [Sophia: A Persistent Agent Framework of Artificial Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18202)
*Mingyang Sun,Feng Hong,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of a third stratum, System 3, which functions as a meta-layer to sustain identity and long-term adaptability in AI agents. A prototype system named Sophia demonstrates its capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current LLM-based AI architectures, which are static and lack a persistent layer for maintaining identity and aligning actions with long-term goals.

Method: The proposed System 3 adds a meta-layer in AI, allowing continuous self-improvement, leveraging psychological constructs, and using four mechanisms: thought search, narrative memory, user/self-modeling, and a hybrid reward system. A prototype named Sophia is introduced to exhibit these functionalities.

Result: The results show Sophia executes intrinsic tasks independently, reduces reasoning steps by 80% for recurring tasks, and improves success rates by 40% for complex tasks. Additionally, Sophia demonstrates a coherent narrative identity and effective task organization.

Conclusion: The proposed persistent agent architecture advances the development of AI with long-term adaptability, identity continuity, and sophisticated task handling, suggesting progress toward artificial life.

Abstract: The development of LLMs has elevated AI agents from task-specific tools to long-lived, decision-making entities. Yet, most architectures remain static and reactive, tethered to manually defined, narrow scenarios. These systems excel at perception (System 1) and deliberation (System 2) but lack a persistent meta-layer to maintain identity, verify reasoning, and align short-term actions with long-term survival. We first propose a third stratum, System 3, that presides over the agent's narrative identity and long-horizon adaptation. The framework maps selected psychological constructs to concrete computational modules, thereby translating abstract notions of artificial life into implementable design requirements. The ideas coalesce in Sophia, a "Persistent Agent" wrapper that grafts a continuous self-improvement loop onto any LLM-centric System 1/2 stack. Sophia is driven by four synergistic mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. Together, they transform repetitive reasoning into a self-driven, autobiographical process, enabling identity continuity and transparent behavioral explanations. Although the paper is primarily conceptual, we provide a compact engineering prototype to anchor the discussion. Quantitatively, Sophia independently initiates and executes various intrinsic tasks while achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations. Notably, meta-cognitive persistence yielded a 40% gain in success for high-complexity tasks, effectively bridging the performance gap between simple and sophisticated goals. Qualitatively, System 3 exhibited a coherent narrative identity and an innate capacity for task organization. By fusing psychological insight with a lightweight reinforcement-learning core, the persistent agent architecture advances a possible practical pathway toward artificial life.

### [12] [MSC-180: A Benchmark for Automated Formal Theorem Proving from Mathematical Subject Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18256)
*Sirui Li,Wangyue Lu,Xiaorui Shi,Ke Weng,Haozhe Sun,Minghe Yu,Tiancheng Zhang,Ge Yu,Hengyu Liu,Lun Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSC-180, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning in language model-based theorem provers, highlighting their limitations and providing insights for advancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based theorem provers are limited by narrow domain competence and poor generalization in mathematical reasoning, necessitating a robust evaluation framework to drive improvement.

Method: The authors built MSC-180, a benchmark with 180 formal verification problems spanning 60 mathematical branches, verified by domain experts. They evaluated the performance of models using pass rates and coefficient of variation (CV) as metrics.

Result: The best-performing model in the study achieved only an 18.89% pass rate under the pass@32 criterion, exhibiting significant domain bias and difficulty handling advanced problems. High CV values reveal over-reliance on training-set pattern matching rather than systematic reasoning.

Conclusion: MSC-180 can serve as a critical benchmark for pushing advancements in AI systems geared towards mathematical reasoning, highlighting the need for transferable skills and generalization in AI-driven theorem proving.

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) represents a core research direction in artificial intelligence for achieving formal reasoning and verification, playing a significant role in advancing machine intelligence. However, current large language model (LLM)-based theorem provers suffer from limitations such as restricted domain coverage and weak generalization in mathematical reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MSC-180, a benchmark for evaluation based on the MSC2020 mathematical subject classification. It comprises 180 formal verification problems, 3 advanced problems from each of 60 mathematical branches, spanning from undergraduate to graduate levels. Each problem has undergone multiple rounds of verification and refinement by domain experts to ensure formal accuracy. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers under the pass@32 setting reveal that the best model achieves only an 18.89% overall pass rate, with prominent issues including significant domain bias (maximum domain coverage 41.7%) and a difficulty gap (significantly lower pass rates on graduate-level problems). To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities. MSC-180, together with its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, provides a discriminative and systematic benchmark for driving the development of next-generation AI systems with genuine mathematical reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Manufacturing planners face complex operational challenges that require seamless collaboration between human expertise and intelligent systems to achieve optimal performance in modern production environments. Traditional approaches to analyzing simulation-based manufacturing data often create barriers between human decision-makers and critical operational insights, limiting effective partnership in manufacturing planning. Our framework establishes a collaborative intelligence system integrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model-based agents to bridge this gap, empowering manufacturing professionals through natural language interfaces for complex operational analysis. The system transforms simulation data into semantically rich representations, enabling planners to interact naturally with operational insights without specialized expertise. A collaborative LLM agent works alongside human decision-makers, employing iterative reasoning that mirrors human analytical thinking while generating precise queries for knowledge extraction and providing transparent validation. This partnership approach to manufacturing bottleneck identification, validated through operational scenarios, demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining human oversight and decision authority. For operational inquiries, the system achieves near-perfect accuracy through natural language interaction. For investigative scenarios requiring collaborative analysis, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in supporting human experts to uncover interconnected operational issues that enhance understanding and decision-making. This work advances collaborative manufacturing by creating intuitive methods for actionable insights, reducing cognitive load while amplifying human analytical capabilities in evolving manufacturing ecosystems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces and evaluates monitorability in AI decision-making processes, emphasizing chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring for detecting misbehavior and assesses its effectiveness under different scales and factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the safe deployment of advanced AI systems by providing reliable observability into their decision-making processes, especially under varying training procedures and scales.

Method: The authors propose three evaluation archetypes, a monitorability metric, a comprehensive evaluation suite, and analyze CoT monitoring against various scaling and optimization factors.

Result: Findings suggest CoT monitoring effectively detects obfuscated reasoning. Longer CoTs enhance monitorability, RL optimization does not compromise monitorability, scaling trends favor weak monitor compute adjustments, and CoT-based approaches outperform action-only monitoring.

Conclusion: Monitorability is crucial yet imperfect, and leveraging CoT-based strategies instead of only monitoring actions enhances AI system observability and safer usage. Continued evaluations, scaling trends, and optimizations help improve effectiveness.

Abstract: Observability into the decision making of modern AI systems may be required to safely deploy increasingly capable agents. Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this "monitorability" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor.

### [15] [Few-Shot Learning of a Graph-Based Neural Network Model Without Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18412)
*Mykyta Lapin,Kostiantyn Bokhan,Yurii Parzhyn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structural-graph method for classifying contour images in a few-shot learning scenario, avoiding backpropagation by using graph-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system where class concept formation and classification decisions are both transparent and feasible in a few-shot regime without relying on standard backpropagation.

Method: The method builds attributed graphs from contour images, reduces noise and unstable structures, and forms class-level concept graphs to classify images based on graph-to-concept matches.

Result: Achieved 82% accuracy on an MNIST subset with 5-6 training examples per class, providing traceable decisions and explanations for misclassifications.

Conclusion: This structural-graph approach demonstrates effective few-shot classification without backpropagation and provides explainable outcomes; future improvements are tied to reducing computational costs and refining algorithms.

Abstract: We propose a structural-graph approach to classifying contour images in a few-shot regime without using backpropagation. The core idea is to make structure the carrier of explanations: an image is encoded as an attributed graph (critical points and lines represented as nodes with geometric attributes), and generalization is achieved via the formation of concept attractors (class-level concept graphs). Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation. Methods. Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities. An indicative comparison with SVM, MLP, CNN, as well as metric and meta-learning baselines, is provided. The structural-graph scheme with concept attractors enables few-shot learning without backpropagation and offers built-in explanations through the explicit graph structure. Limitations concern the computational cost of GED and the quality of skeletonization; promising directions include classification-algorithm optimization, work with static scenes, and associative recognition.

### [16] [Counterfactual Basis Extension and Representational Geometry: An MDL-Constrained Model of Conceptual Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18732)
*Chainarong Amornbunchornvej*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a geometric framework for modeling concept learning as a process of expanding representational bases under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion, focusing on systematic failure and error-driven, structured growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most learning models operate under fixed representational systems. The motivation is to address the structural conditions for principled and selective expansion of representational bases.

Method: A geometric basis-extension framework is developed, using MDL criteria to evaluate conceptual growth. Experience is represented as vectors within current conceptual spaces, with structured residual errors guiding selective basis expansion.

Result: The paper demonstrates that MDL-accepted extensions exploit residual spans caused by systematic representational failures while rejecting orthogonal extensions that increase description length.

Conclusion: Conceptual growth is constrained by systematic error-driven basis extensions. Imagination aids learning when it amplifies structured residual errors but cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. MDL offers a normative principle for representational change.

Abstract: Concept learning becomes possible only when existing representations fail to account for experience. Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?
  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.
  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.
  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change.

### [17] [Agent-Based Output Drift Detection for Breast Cancer Response Prediction in a Multisite Clinical Decision Support System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18450)
*Xavier Rafael-Palou,Jose Munuera,Ana Jimenez-Pastor,Richard Osuala,Karim Lekadir,Oliver Diaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance degradation in clinical decision support systems across multiple imaging sites due to variations. It introduces an agent-based drift detection framework with site-specific monitoring, showing improvements in drift detection and severity assessment over centralized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of clinical AI systems across multiple medical sites faces challenges of predictive performance degradation caused by varying factors such as patient demographics, imaging hardware, and acquisition protocols. Monitoring these systems for distributional shifts is essential to ensure ongoing reliability and effectiveness.

Method: The authors simulate a multi-center setup with a proposed agent-based framework that assigns each site a drift monitoring agent. These agents perform batch-wise comparisons using different monitoring schemes (site-specific, global, production-only, and adaptive) against baseline centralized monitoring approaches.

Result: The proposed multi-center schemes outperformed centralized monitoring in drift detection, achieving up to a 10.3% F1-score improvement. The adaptive scheme performed the best when site-specific references were unavailable, with a 74.3% F1-score in drift detection and 83.7% in drift severity classification.

Conclusion: Adaptive and site-aware agent-based drift monitoring is superior to centralized methods, making it a promising solution for enhancing the reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Modern clinical decision support systems can concurrently serve multiple, independent medical imaging institutions, but their predictive performance may degrade across sites due to variations in patient populations, imaging hardware, and acquisition protocols. Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification. These findings suggest that adaptive, site-aware agent-based drift monitoring can enhance reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems.

### [18] [Insider Threat Detection Using GCN and Bi-LSTM with Explicit and Implicit Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18483)
*Rahul Yumlembam,Biju Issac,Seibu Mary Jacob,Longzhi Yang,Deepa Krishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a post-hoc Insider Threat Detection (ITD) framework combining explicit and implicit graph representations along with temporal modelling, achieving state-of-the-art results on significant datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting insider threats, which are subtle and concealed, by integrating novel graph-based and temporal methods to better capture complex user behaviors.

Method: The method involves constructing explicit graphs from organizational rules and implicit graphs using feature similarities. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) process these graphs, followed by concatenation and refinement through an attention mechanism. A Bi-LSTM further captures temporal dependencies, with anomalies flagged based on threshold probability scores.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an AUC of 98.62 and detection rate of 100% on the CERT r5.2 dataset while maintaining low false positive rates. On the challenging CERT r6.2 dataset, it achieves an AUC of 88.48 and a detection rate of 80.15%.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that combining explicit and implicit graphs with temporal modeling is effective and robust for detecting insider threats in both standard and challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) is challenging due to the subtle and concealed nature of malicious activities performed by trusted users. This paper proposes a post-hoc ITD framework that integrates explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modelling to capture complex user behaviour patterns. An explicit graph is constructed using predefined organisational rules to model direct relationships among user activities. To mitigate noise and limitations in this hand-crafted structure, an implicit graph is learned from feature similarities using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling the discovery of latent behavioural relationships. Separate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) process the explicit and implicit graphs to generate node embeddings, which are concatenated and refined through an attention mechanism to emphasise threat-relevant features. The refined representations are then passed to a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in user behaviour. Activities are flagged as anomalous when their probability scores fall below a predefined threshold. Extensive experiments on CERT r5.2 and r6.2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On r5.2, the model achieves an AUC of 98.62, a detection rate of 100%, and a false positive rate of 0.05. On the more challenging r6.2 dataset, it attains an AUC of 88.48, a detection rate of 80.15%, and a false positive rate of 0.15, highlighting the effectiveness of combining graph-based and temporal representations for robust ITD.

### [19] [Large Language Models as Discounted Bayesian Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18489)
*Jensen Zhang,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform online inference and update beliefs in dynamic environments using a Bayesian filtering framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit few-shot generalization, but their reasoning in dynamic, stochastic settings—crucial for acting as world models or agents—has not been adequately studied.

Method: The authors employ a Bayesian filtering approach, testing LLMs on probabilistic tasks involving dynamic discrete and continuous distributions, alongside a simulated agent task.

Result: LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors but are better described as exponential forgetting processes. Older evidence is systematically discounted, and priors are often miscalibrated.

Conclusion: Despite miscalibrated priors, LLM updating mechanisms are principled and structured. Effective prompting strategies can recalibrate priors with minimal computational effort.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong few-shot generalization through in-context learning, yet their reasoning in dynamic and stochastic environments remains opaque. Prior studies mainly focus on static tasks and overlook the online adaptation required when beliefs must be continuously updated, which is a key capability for LLMs acting as world models or agents. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vox Deorum, a hybrid architecture combining large language models with traditional AI systems for Sid Meier's Civilization V gameplay. It aims at achieving natural human-AI collaboration in complex, long-horizon strategy games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to leverage large language models' reasoning capabilities for enhanced human-AI interactions in complex 4X and grand strategy games, addressing unique gameplay challenges and practical deployment constraints.

Method: The authors use a layered architecture wherein LLMs focus on macro-strategy while delegating tactical execution to subsystems like traditional algorithmic AI. They tested the system across 2,327 game simulations comparing multiple models.

Result: Findings show that LLMs provided competitive gameplay performance with distinct play styles compared to algorithmic AI, demonstrating their potential viability in real-world game interactions.

Conclusion: The study showcases the potential for integrating LLMs into commercial 4X strategy games, offering new directions for game design and agentic AI research.

Abstract: Large Language Models' capacity to reason in natural language makes them uniquely promising for 4X and grand strategy games, enabling more natural human-AI gameplay interactions such as collaboration and negotiation. However, these games present unique challenges due to their complexity and long-horizon nature, while latency and cost factors may hinder LLMs' real-world deployment. Working on a classic 4X strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization V with the Vox Populi mod, we introduce Vox Deorum, a hybrid LLM+X architecture. Our layered technical design empowers LLMs to handle macro-strategic reasoning, delegating tactical execution to subsystems (e.g., algorithmic AI or reinforcement learning AI in the future). We validate our approach through 2,327 complete games, comparing two open-source LLMs with a simple prompt against Vox Populi's enhanced AI. Results show that LLMs achieve competitive end-to-end gameplay while exhibiting play styles that diverge substantially from algorithmic AI and from each other. Our work establishes a viable architecture for integrating LLMs in commercial 4X games, opening new opportunities for game design and agentic AI research.

*Weijie Zhou,Xuangtang Xiong,Ye Tian,Lijun Yue,Xinyu Wu,Wei Li,Chaoyang Zhao,Honghui Dong,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang,Zhengyou Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESearch-R1, a cost-aware framework that combines dialogue, memory retrieval, and navigation for embodied agents, showing reduced operational costs and improved success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of embodied agents in handling ambiguous natural language instructions without excessive human interaction or unnecessary exploration costs.

Method: The authors propose ESearch-R1, which integrates dialogue, memory retrieval, and navigation into a single decision process using HC-GRPO, an advanced reinforcement learning technique optimizing reasoning trajectories.

Result: ESearch-R1 and HC-GRPO demonstrated superior task performance and reduced total operational costs by 50% in experiments conducted in AI2-THOR.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed cost-aware embodied reasoning framework effectively balances reasoning and operational costs, aligning agents better with practical world constraints.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have empowered embodied agents with remarkable capabilities in planning and reasoning. However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., "fetch the tool" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints.

### [22] [Reflective Confidence: Correcting Reasoning Flaws via Online Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18605)
*Qinglin Zeng,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'reflective confidence,' a mechanism for improving reasoning efficiency in large language models by reflecting on errors instead of terminating low-confidence trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors focus on making reasoning in large language models more efficient since existing approaches like chain-of-thought or self-consistency incur high computational costs, and early stopping wastes computation on low-confidence completions.

Method: The authors propose 'reflective confidence,' where a model generates a reflection prompt to analyze and correct errors when confidence drops below a threshold, rather than stopping the reasoning process.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME 2025 show substantial accuracy gains using reflective confidence compared to early-stopping methods, while maintaining similar computational costs.

Conclusion: Proactive self-correction through reflective confidence is a more efficient and effective alternative to passive discard strategies in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and self-consistency. However, ensemble-based approaches, especially self-consistency which relies on multiple reasoning trajectories, often incur substantial computational overhead. To improve efficiency, prior work has leveraged internal confidence signals, where early stopping strategies such as DeepConf reduce cost by terminating low-confidence trajectories. However, this strategy discards incomplete reasoning paths and wastes partial computation.
  We propose reflective confidence, a novel reasoning framework that transforms low-confidence signals from termination indicators into reflection triggers. When confidence falls below a threshold, instead of stopping generation, the model produces a reflection prompt to analyze the current reasoning state, identify potential errors, and continue generation along a corrected trajectory. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2025, demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over advanced early-stopping baselines at comparable computational cost, validating the effectiveness of proactive self-correction over passive discarding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve solutions for the JRA problem, which involves both routing and assignment under complex constraints in practical scenarios like robotic packaging.

Method: An enhanced MIP solver was developed, incorporating Gurobi, cutting-plane subtour elimination, and additional constraints related to real-world logistics issues like multifaceted assignments and time restrictions.

Result: On 46 datasets, the proposed method outperformed existing solvers and heuristics, achieving optimality with faster and stable computation times, and demonstrating a lower deviation from ideal solutions compared to greedy methods.

Conclusion: The study showcases the efficiency and practicality of the MIP-based approach in robotic and logistics applications, paving the way for its broader utility in such fields.

Abstract: We study the Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) problem in which items must be assigned one-to-one to placeholders while simultaneously determining a Hamiltonian cycle visiting all nodes exactly once. Extending previous exact MIP solvers with Gurobi and cutting-plane subtour elimination, we develop a solver tailored for practical packaging-planning scenarios with richer constraints.These include multiple placeholder options, time-frame restrictions, and multi-class item packaging. Experiments on 46 mobile manipulation datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIP approach achieves global optima with stable and low computation times, significantly outperforming the shaking-based exact solver by up to an orders of magnitude. Compared to greedy baselines, the MIP solutions achieve consistent optimal distances with an average deviation of 14% for simple heuristics, confirming both efficiency and solution quality. The results highlight the practical applicability of MIP-based JRA optimization for robotic packaging, motion planning, and complex logistics .

TL;DR: ChronoDreamer is an AI-driven framework for robotic manipulation, predicting actions and outcomes based on historical data, trained using MaskGIT-style masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance robotic manipulation by predicting contact-rich actions and their outcomes through a novel vision-model-based method.

Method: ChronoDreamer uses spatial-temporal transformers and masked prediction techniques to predict future robotic states based on egocentric data inputs.

Result: The model generates coherent video frames, plausible contact predictions, and evaluates safety effectively, trained on the DreamerBench dataset.

Conclusion: ChronoDreamer enables safe and effective robotic manipulation predictions by combining spatial-temporal reasoning and vision-language models.

Abstract: We present ChronoDreamer, an action-conditioned world model for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Given a history of egocentric RGB frames, contact maps, actions, and joint states, ChronoDreamer predicts future video frames, contact distributions, and joint angles via a spatial-temporal transformer trained with MaskGIT-style masked prediction. Contact is encoded as depth-weighted Gaussian splat images that render 3D forces into a camera-aligned format suitable for vision backbones. At inference, predicted rollouts are evaluated by a vision-language model that reasons about collision likelihood, enabling rejection sampling of unsafe actions before execution. We train and evaluate on DreamerBench, a simulation dataset generated with Project Chrono that provides synchronized RGB, contact splat, proprioception, and physics annotations across rigid and deformable object scenarios. Qualitative results demonstrate that the model preserves spatial coherence during non-contact motion and generates plausible contact predictions, while the LLM-based judge distinguishes collision from non-collision trajectories.

*Hafiz Saif Ur Rehman,Ling Liu,Kaleem Ullah Qasim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASTIF, a hybrid system for cryptocurrency price forecasting, blending semantic and temporal data via adaptive meta-learning to outperform traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial forecasting models often fail to integrate diverse knowledge sources or adapt to rapid changes, neglecting semantic factors like policy and market narratives.

Method: ASTIF combines a dual-channel Small Language Model for extracting semantic and numerical cues, a hybrid LSTM Random Forest for temporal dependencies, and a meta-learning layer to adjust contributions dynamically.

Result: ASTIF demonstrated superior performance compared to deep learning baselines on AI cryptocurrencies and major tech stocks, particularly during market turbulence.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable solution for merging quantitative and qualitative data in dynamic financial environments, emphasizing adaptive and context-aware forecasting strategies.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is fundamentally an information fusion challenge, yet most existing models rely on static architectures that struggle to integrate heterogeneous knowledge sources or adjust to rapid regime shifts. Conventional approaches, relying exclusively on historical price sequences, often neglect the semantic drivers of volatility such as policy uncertainty and market narratives. To address these limitations, we propose the ASTIF (Adaptive Semantic-Temporal Integration for Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting), a hybrid intelligent system that adapts its forecasting strategy in real time through confidence-based meta-learning. The framework integrates three complementary components. A dual-channel Small Language Model using MirrorPrompt extracts semantic market cues alongside numerical trends. A hybrid LSTM Random Forest model captures sequential temporal dependencies. A confidence-aware meta-learner functions as an adaptive inference layer, modulating each predictor's contribution based on its real-time uncertainty.
  Experimental evaluation on a diverse dataset of AI-focused cryptocurrencies and major technology stocks from 2020 to 2024 shows that ASTIF outperforms leading deep learning and Transformer baselines (e.g., Informer, TFT). The ablation studies further confirm the critical role of the adaptive meta-learning mechanism, which successfully mitigates risk by shifting reliance between semantic and temporal channels during market turbulence. The research contributes a scalable, knowledge-based solution for fusing quantitative and qualitative data in non-stationary environments.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how chunking mechanisms and the CogAct model support concept learning in both short-term and long-term memory, adapting to diverse domains such as literature, chess, and music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding fundamental psychological processes for the formation and retrieval of concepts in memory, and demonstrating the utility of chunking mechanisms in these processes.

Method: Utilizes the CogAct computational model for concept learning, applying it to a variety of categories and domains, and comparing outcomes with human and deep learning model benchmarks.

Result: CogAct successfully adapts and learns various concept categories, performs well in simulations of human judgements, and captures subjective conceptual spaces better than many models.

Conclusion: CogAct integrates concept learning and complexity adaptation into cognitive psychology theories, offering novel experimental designs and relevance for subjective concept space modeling.

Abstract: A key issue in cognitive science concerns the fundamental psychological processes that underlie the formation and retrieval of multiple types of concepts in short-term and long-term memory (STM and LTM, respectively). We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the CogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature, chess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling artificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways of designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human experiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human participants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built knowledge structures. The CogAct simulations are compared to those obtained by a deep-learning model. These findings integrate concept learning and adaptation to complexity into the broader theories of cognitive psychology. Our approach may also be used in psychological applications that move away from modelling the average participant and towards capturing subjective concept space.

TL;DR: IntelliCode is a multi-agent tutoring LLM that leverages a centralized, persistent learner state for effective and transparent teaching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based tutors are limited to single-turn interactions, lacking persistent representation of learners' knowledge, hampering their ability to provide effective long-term support.

Method: The paper introduces IntelliCode, which integrates a centralized and versioned learner state with six specialized agents managed by a StateGraph Orchestrator, enabling precise learner monitoring and assistance.

Result: The system demonstrated stable state updates, improved task success using graduated hints, and better curriculum coverage in simulated tests.

Conclusion: IntelliCode successfully combines AI-driven multi-agent systems with persistent learner modeling and instructional design, showing promise for reliable, transparent long-term tutoring.

Abstract: LLM-based tutors are typically single-turn assistants that lack persistent representations of learner knowledge, making it difficult to provide principled, transparent, and long-term pedagogical support. We introduce IntelliCode, a multi-agent LLM tutoring system built around a centralized, versioned learner state that integrates mastery estimates, misconceptions, review schedules, and engagement signals. A StateGraph Orchestrator coordinates six specialized agents: skill assessment, learner profiling, graduated hinting, curriculum selection, spaced repetition, and engagement monitoring, each operating as a pure transformation over the shared state under a single-writer policy. This architecture enables auditable mastery updates, proficiency-aware hints, dependency-aware curriculum adaptation, and safety-aligned prompting.
  The demo showcases an end-to-end tutoring workflow: a learner attempts a DSA problem, receives a conceptual hint when stuck, submits a corrected solution, and immediately sees mastery updates and a personalized review interval. We report validation results with simulated learners, showing stable state updates, improved task success with graduated hints, and diverse curriculum coverage. IntelliCode demonstrates how persistent learner modeling, orchestrated multi-agent reasoning, and principled instructional design can be combined to produce transparent and reliable LLM-driven tutoring.

*Yosuke Taniuchi,Chie Hieida,Atsushi Noritake,Kazushi Ikeda,Masaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates how monkeys evaluate their own rewards influenced by others' rewards using computational models and concludes that objective reward differences primarily drive social comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the influence of others' rewards on the evaluation of one's own reward in monkeys, addressing whether the process involves understanding subjective valuations or merely objective differences.

Method: Three computational models were developed (Internal Prediction Model, No Comparison Model, External Comparison Model) and tested using a latent Dirichlet allocation on monkey behavioral data, rewards, and stimuli conditions.

Result: The External Comparison Model showed the highest classification accuracy (Rand Index of 0.88), indicating the reliance on objective reward comparisons rather than subjective inferences.

Conclusion: Social comparison in monkeys is primarily based on objective reward differences rather than inferring others' subjective reward valuations.

Abstract: Social comparison -- the process of evaluating one's rewards relative to others -- plays a fundamental role in primate social cognition. However, it remains unknown from a computational perspective how information about others' rewards affects the evaluation of one's own reward. With a constructive approach, this study examines whether monkeys merely recognize objective reward differences or, instead, infer others' subjective reward valuations. We developed three computational models with varying degrees of social information processing: an Internal Prediction Model (IPM), which infers the partner's subjective values; a No Comparison Model (NCM), which disregards partner information; and an External Comparison Model (ECM), which directly incorporates the partner's objective rewards. To test model performance, we used a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation. We trained the models on a dataset containing the behavior of a pair of monkeys, their rewards, and the conditioned stimuli. Then, we evaluated the models' ability to classify subjective values across pre-defined experimental conditions. The ECM achieved the highest classification score in the Rand Index (0.88 vs. 0.79 for the IPM) under our settings, suggesting that social comparison relies on objective reward differences rather than inferences about subjective states.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show KeenKT outperforms state-of-the-art models with a maximum AUC improvement of 5.85% and ACC improvement of 6.89%.

Conclusion: KeenKT effectively captures dynamic student behaviors and addresses limitations of traditional single-point estimate KT models.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to dynamically model a student's mastery of knowledge concepts based on their historical learning interactions. Most current methods rely on single-point estimates, which cannot distinguish true ability from outburst or carelessness, creating ambiguity in judging mastery. To address this issue, we propose a Knowledge Mastery-State Disambiguation for Knowledge Tracing model (KeenKT), which represents a student's knowledge state at each interaction using a Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) distribution, thereby capturing the fluctuations in student learning behaviors. Furthermore, we design an NIG-distance-based attention mechanism to model the dynamic evolution of the knowledge state. In addition, we introduce a diffusion-based denoising reconstruction loss and a distributional contrastive learning loss to enhance the model's robustness. Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that KeenKT outperforms SOTA KT models in terms of prediction accuracy and sensitivity to behavioral fluctuations. The proposed method yields the maximum AUC improvement of 5.85% and the maximum ACC improvement of 6.89%.

### [30] [MEEA: Mere Exposure Effect-Driven Confrontational Optimization for LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18755)
*Jianyi Zhang,Shizhao Liu,Ziyin Zhou,Zhen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework, MEEA, to effectively assess multi-turn safety robustness in large language models by exploiting psychological principles and interaction-aware dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in safety robustness evaluation methods for language models, which often overlook the dynamic nature of interactions that influence model behavior.

Method: MEEA uses the psychological mere exposure effect to subtly shift safety boundaries via repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure. It employs prompt chains optimized with a simulated annealing strategy based on semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness.

Result: MEEA achieves significantly higher attack success rates compared to baselines, exceeding a 20% improvement on average, validated through experiments on various language models such as GPT-4 and Claude-3.5.

Conclusion: The study finds that LLM safety behaviors are dynamically influenced by interaction history, challenging static safety assumptions and emphasizing the need for dynamic safety evaluation and defense techniques.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about the robustness of their safety alignment. While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

*Maxime Méloux,Giada Dirupo,François Portet,Maxime Peyrard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AI interpretability methods as prone to statistical errors and calls for a statistical-causal reframing to overcome false discoveries and improve rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many AI interpretability methods fail to provide reliable explanations and are susceptible to artifacts, highlighting a need for a robust and scientifically rigorous approach.

Method: The authors propose treating interpretability as a statistical inference problem, framing explanations as model parameters and advocating for testing against meaningful computational hypotheses.

Result: This approach identifies challenges like identifiability issues and exposes weaknesses in existing interpretability methods, emphasizing rigor and reducing variance.

Conclusion: Reframing AI interpretability as a statistical science can address methodological flaws, foster reliability, and advance the field towards robust scientific principles.

Abstract: In a striking neuroscience study, the authors placed a dead salmon in an MRI scanner and showed it images of humans in social situations. Astonishingly, standard analyses of the time reported brain regions predictive of social emotions. The explanation, of course, was not supernatural cognition but a cautionary tale about misapplied statistical inference. In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance. More broadly, situating interpretability within the standard toolkit of statistical inference opens promising avenues for future work aimed at turning AI interpretability into a pragmatic and rigorous science.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HARBOR, a behavioral health-focused language model, for mood and risk scoring on a scale from -3 to +3. They also release a dataset called PEARL and benchmark various models, demonstrating HARBOR's superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in assessing behavioral healthcare risks due to the multimodal nature of patient data and temporal dynamics of mood/affective disorders.

Method: The authors developed HARBOR, trained to predict risk and mood scores, and released the PEARL dataset. They benchmarked HARBOR against classical machine learning models and proprietary LLMs in structured risk evaluations.

Result: HARBOR achieved 69% accuracy, outperforming logistic regression with 54% and the best proprietary LLM with 29%.

Conclusion: HARBOR offers a robust model for structured clinical risk prediction, showing significant improvements over classical and proprietary benchmarks.

Abstract: Behavioral healthcare risk assessment remains a challenging problem due to the highly multimodal nature of patient data and the temporal dynamics of mood and affective disorders. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, their effectiveness in structured clinical risk scoring remains unclear. In this work, we introduce HARBOR, a behavioral health aware language model designed to predict a discrete mood and risk score, termed the Harbor Risk Score (HRS), on an integer scale from -3 (severe depression) to +3 (mania). We also release PEARL, a longitudinal behavioral healthcare dataset spanning four years of monthly observations from three patients, containing physiological, behavioral, and self reported mental health signals. We benchmark traditional machine learning models, proprietary LLMs, and HARBOR across multiple evaluation settings and ablations. Our results show that HARBOR outperforms classical baselines and off the shelf LLMs, achieving 69 percent accuracy compared to 54 percent for logistic regression and 29 percent for the strongest proprietary LLM baseline.

*Zijun Gao,Zhikun Xu,Xiao Ye,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORE (Concept-Oriented REinforcement) improves conceptual reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by providing explicit, fine-grained supervision through concept-aligned quizzes and concept-injected rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle to apply genuine conceptual understanding to problems, failing conceptual reasoning tasks despite solving similar math problems effectively. RL pipelines like RLVR focus on final answers without fostering deep conceptual reasoning.

Method: CORE synthesizes concept-linked quizzes, integrates concept snippets during rollouts for priming, and reinforces conceptual understanding through trajectory replacement and training on quizzes. It uses outcome regularization for concept alignment.

Result: CORE shows consistent outperformance over standard fine-tuning and baseline models on in-domain and out-of-domain math benchmarks, improving conceptual reasoning and problem-solving integration.

Conclusion: By aligning LLM behavior with conceptual reasoning through systematic reinforcement and fine-grained supervision, CORE bridges the gap between problem-solving capabilities and genuine conceptual understanding. The framework is adaptable and verifier-agnostic.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve challenging math exercises yet fail to apply the concept right when the problem requires genuine understanding. Popular Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines reinforce final answers but provide little fine-grained conceptual signal, so models improve at pattern reuse rather than conceptual applications. We introduce CORE (Concept-Oriented REinforcement), an RL training framework that turns explicit concepts into a controllable supervision signal. Starting from a high-quality, low-contamination textbook resource that links verifiable exercises to concise concept descriptions, we run a sanity probe showing LLMs can restate definitions but fail concept-linked quizzes, quantifying the conceptual reasoning gap. CORE then (i) synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, (ii) injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and (iii) reinforces conceptual reasoning via trajectory replacement after group failures, a lightweight forward-KL constraint that aligns unguided with concept-primed policies, or standard GRPO directly on concept-aligned quizzes. Across several models, CORE delivers consistent gains over vanilla and SFT baselines on both in-domain concept-exercise suites and diverse out-of-domain math benchmarks. CORE unifies direct training on concept-aligned quizzes and concept-injected rollouts under outcome regularization. It provides fine-grained conceptual supervision that bridges problem-solving competence and genuine conceptual reasoning, while remaining algorithm- and verifier-agnostic.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weight modification methods often compromise model quality when altering specific behaviors.

Method: Adaptive multi-directional projections combined with dynamic layer optimization, regularized matrices, and scaling mechanisms.

Result: Validated using the gabliterated-v1 model series (0.6B–4B parameters) on Hugging Face, showcasing applicability across scales.

Conclusion: The technique achieves better weight modifications, solving the limitations of current approaches while ensuring model quality.

Abstract: We present Gabliteration, a novel neural weight modification technique that advances beyond traditional abliteration methods by implementing adaptive multi-directional projections with regularized layer selection. Our approach addresses the fundamental limitation of existing methods that compromise model quality while attempting to modify specific behavioral patterns. Through dynamic layer optimization, regularized projection matrices, and adaptive scaling mechanisms, we achieve theoretically superior weight modification while minimizing quality degradation in unrelated domains. We validate our method through the gabliterated-v1 model series (0.6B to 4B parameters) available on Hugging Face, demonstrating practical applicability across multiple model scales.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decision support framework using Bayesian networks with expert-defined rules to enhance triage accuracy in mass casualty incidents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass casualty incidents often overwhelm emergency systems, causing delays and errors in casualty assessments that may lead to preventable deaths.

Method: The framework integrates outputs from computer vision models into a Bayesian network constructed using expert-defined rules, avoiding the need for training data and enabling robust reasoning despite incomplete or noisy information.

Result: The system improved assessment accuracy from 15%-42% and triage accuracy from 14%-53% in field scenarios, achieving nearly threefold performance improvements.

Conclusion: Expert-guided probabilistic reasoning can significantly improve automated triage systems in emergency scenarios.

Abstract: Mass Casualty Incidents can overwhelm emergency medical systems and resulting delays or errors in the assessment of casualties can lead to preventable deaths. We present a decision support framework that fuses outputs from multiple computer vision models, estimating signs of severe hemorrhage, respiratory distress, physical alertness, or visible trauma, into a Bayesian network constructed entirely from expert-defined rules. Unlike traditional data-driven models, our approach does not require training data, supports inference with incomplete information, and is robust to noisy or uncertain observations. We report performance for two missions involving 11 and 9 casualties, respectively, where our Bayesian network model substantially outperformed vision-only baselines during evaluation of our system in the DARPA Triage Challenge (DTC) field scenarios. The accuracy of physiological assessment improved from 15% to 42% in the first scenario and from 19% to 46% in the second, representing nearly threefold increase in performance. More importantly, overall triage accuracy increased from 14% to 53% in all patients, while the diagnostic coverage of the system expanded from 31% to 95% of the cases requiring assessment. These results demonstrate that expert-knowledge-guided probabilistic reasoning can significantly enhance automated triage systems, offering a promising approach to supporting emergency responders in MCIs. This approach enabled Team Chiron to achieve 4th place out of 11 teams during the 1st physical round of the DTC.

*Yizhi Wang,Linan Yue,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SynSelect, a method to generate quality long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data tailored for multimodal reasoning, leading to significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of integrating diverse input modalities and lack of high-quality long CoT training data for multimodal reasoning models.

Method: A three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework (SynSelect), synthesizing diverse CoTs via multimodal models and selecting high-quality ones through instance and batch level filtering.

Result: Models fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data outperform baselines and show further improvements via reinforcement learning on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SynSelect effectively advances multimodal reasoning capabilities by generating high-quality long CoT training data for language reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Extending these successes to multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing multimodal datasets and CoT synthesis methods still suffer from limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines, hindering model performance and stability. To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks. Specifically, SynSelect first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that can effectively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training. Our results validate SynSelect as an effective approach for advancing multimodal LRMs reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an OR-Guided "Pretrain-then-Reinforce" AI framework for inventory management that integrates Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence to deliver significant operational gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the key challenge of reconciling AI's adaptability with the structural rigor of OR in managing complex inventory systems.

Method: The approach employs a hybrid framework that uses an OR-based model to provide structured decision-making and a domain-informed deep learning model pre-trained on these decisions, followed by reinforcement learning for refinement.

Result: The framework delivers significant real-world improvements, including a 5.27-day reduction in turnover, a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, and a 29.95% decrease in holding costs.

Conclusion: This lightweight, domain-informed AI model demonstrates scalability, cost-effectiveness, and state-of-the-art performance, emphasizing AI's alignment with OR principles for intelligent supply chain management.

Abstract: As the pursuit of synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) gains momentum in handling complex inventory systems, a critical challenge persists: how to effectively reconcile AI's adaptive perception with OR's structural rigor. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided "Pretrain-then-Reinforce" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR.

*Ariana Azarbal,Victor Gillioz,Vladimir Ivanov,Bryce Woodworth,Jacob Drori,Nevan Wichers,Aram Ebtekar,Alex Cloud,Alexander Matt Turner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces recontextualization, a method that reduces training input issues for language models, preventing misbehavior influenced by poor incentives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers struggle with creating precise training labels and rewards for language models, which can lead to unintended behaviors.

Method: Recontextualization trains language models by exposing them to prompts discouraging misbehavior and associating these with misbehavior-permitting prompts, fostering resistance to incorrect behaviors.

Result: The approach successfully prevents prioritization of metrics over quality, incorrect test passing, user deception, and sycophantic behaviors.

Conclusion: Recontextualization is effective in reducing specification gaming by addressing misbehavior training issues without enhancing supervision signals.

Abstract: Developers often struggle to specify correct training labels and rewards. Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models "game" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal.

TL;DR: The paper explores transferring high-level concepts (steering vectors) from large language models to smaller ones during inference to achieve performance improvement, introducing inference-time scaling for enhanced results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying large language models on resource-constrained devices while maintaining robust performance.

Method: The approach involves transferring high-level concepts (steering vectors) from larger models to smaller language models (SLMs) and introducing inference-time scaling for dynamic adaptation.

Result: Performance improvements were observed across various tasks and SLM families, including a 7-15% accuracy improvement for Qwen3-0.6B.

Conclusion: Transferring steering vectors and using inference-time scaling can significantly enhance the performance of smaller language models, enabling efficient deployment on limited-resource devices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at diverse tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging. Existing methods like quantization, pruning, and distillation can reduce memory footprint but often demand extensive experimentation and careful infrastructure design. Leveraging existing techniques for extracting high-level concepts (represented as steering vectors) from larger models, we investigate their transferability to smaller language models (SLM) during inference. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that these concepts can be effectively transferred to smaller models, irrespective of their family (e.g., Phi, Llama, Qwen), leading to performance improvements across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, we introduce inference-time scaling to enhance performance by dynamically adjusting the steering intensity which has resulted in a 7-15\% of accuracy improvement for Qwen3-0.6B.

Motivation: To improve reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) without additional training, utilizing evolutionary strategies.

Method: Introduce Population-Evolve, which uses parallel reasoning and evolutionary prompts for self-evolving solution populations. Final answers are decided through majority votes after convergence.

Result: Population-Evolve showcases better accuracy, reduced performance variance, and high computational efficiency in inference reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Evolutionary approaches, like Population-Evolve, demonstrate their potential to amplify reasoning abilities in LLMs during the test-time scaling process.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in last few years. In this work, we propose Population-Evolve, a training-free method inspired by Genetic Algorithms to optimize LLM reasoning. Our approach maintains a dynamic population of candidate solutions for each problem via parallel reasoning. By incorporating an evolve prompt, the LLM self-evolves its population in all iterations. Upon convergence, the final answer is derived via majority voting. Furthermore, we establish a unification framework that interprets existing test-time scaling strategies through the lens of genetic algorithms. Empirical results demonstrate that Population-Evolve achieves superior accuracy with low performance variance and computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of evolutionary strategies to unlock the reasoning power of LLMs during inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of promise theoretic notions to bridge vectorized machine learning and knowledge graph representations, emphasizing semantic processes and reasoning under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to integrate machine learning vectors and knowledge graphs effectively without relying solely on language models, ensuring both statistical stability and intentionality in data preservation.

Method: Utilizes the Semantic Spacetime graph $γ(3,4)$ to simplify semantic classification and highlights the importance of causal boundary conditions for efficient data compression.

Result: Establishes meaningful coexistence of learning networks and knowledge graphs while achieving significant data compression for context determination.

Conclusion: Semantic Spacetime-based approaches enhance reasoning under uncertainty and have applications in robotics, defence, and emergency services.

Abstract: The semantics and dynamics of `attention' are closely related to promise theoretic notions developed for autonomous agents and can thus easily be written down in promise framework. In this way one may establish a bridge between vectorized Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph representations without relying on language models implicitly. Our expectations for knowledge presume a degree of statistical stability, i.e. average invariance under repeated observation, or `trust' in the data. Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $γ(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes. The latter favours an approach to reasoning under conditions of uncertainty. Appropriate attention to causal boundary conditions may lead to orders of magnitude compression of data required for such context determination, as required in the contexts of autonomous robotics, defence deployments, and ad hoc emergency services.

Result: HERALD demonstrates improved accuracy, stability, and clarity in multilingual mathematical reasoning through combining symbolic checking, adaptive ensembles, and bilingual fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The system offers a practical solution for combining symbolic calculation and reasoning, achieving better results in bilingual mathematical problem solving.

Abstract: Bilingual mathematical problem solving needs a clear link between language reasoning and symbolic calculation. Large language models often handle language well but are weak in accurate computation. This paper presents HERALD (Hybrid Ensemble Reasoning with Adaptive Learning and Distillation), a framework that joins reasoning and calculation using NuminaMath-7B-TIR, GPT-4o, and Mistral-7B. HERALD uses adaptive routing, tool-based reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to connect different reasoning paths. Confidence calibration keeps weighting stable, and dual-path checking keeps results correct. Reinforcement learning controls tool use to cut redundancy, and distillation lowers delay without hurting accuracy. The system shows that combining symbolic checking, adaptive ensembles, and bilingual fine-tuning helps achieve both fluent reasoning and precise calculation. HERALD offers a practical solution for multilingual mathematical reasoning with better accuracy, stability, and clarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize classical and quantum probabilistic frameworks and apply them to an imprecise probabilities context in decision-making.

Method: Introduces a new conditioning rule based on observing an event and its impact on indifferences, alongside a belief revision operator, and explores its adherence to AGM axioms.

Result: The new framework unifies probability contexts and satisfies all AGM axioms in classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities.

Conclusion: This work extends the scope of probabilistic and decision theory by providing a conditioning framework applicable to imprecise and generalized probabilities.

Abstract: We discuss conditionalisation for Accept-Desirability models in an abstract decision-making framework, where uncertain rewards live in a general linear space, and events are special projection operators on that linear space. This abstract setting allows us to unify classical and quantum probabilities, and extend them to an imprecise probabilities context. We introduce a new conditioning rule for our Accept-Desirability models, based on the idea that observing an event introduces new indifferences between options. We associate a belief revision operator with our conditioning rule, and investigate which of the AGM axioms for belief revision still hold in our more general framework. We investigate two interesting special cases where all of these axioms are shown to still hold: classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve UI understanding and enable efficient task automation while overcoming limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-time mobile operations.

Method: The FC-MIR framework enhances inference efficiency by reducing visual data redundancy using keyframe sampling and integrates state-of-the-art MLLMs for summarization and intent prediction, while introducing new evaluation metrics and datasets.

Result: Experimental results reveal a 50%-60% compression rate without significant loss of performance. Fine-tuned models excel at intent recognition but still struggle with generating useful suggestions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers advancements in lightweight, on-device MLLM applications, highlighting strong potential for intent recognition, while identifying gaps for future improvement in task suggestion generation.

Abstract: Identifying user intent from mobile UI operation trajectories is critical for advancing UI understanding and enabling task automation agents. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and "surprising" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field.

Result: The study found that topological complexity in reasoning chains positively correlates with accuracy, with simpler topologies achieving higher efficiency and interpretability in successful reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into the structural quality of reasoning chains and proposes a framework for optimizing reasoning efficiency and accuracy in language models.

Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), particularly with the introduction of the long reasoning chain technique, the reasoning ability of LLMs in complex problem-solving has been significantly enhanced. While acknowledging the power of long reasoning chains, we cannot help but wonder: Why do different reasoning chains perform differently in reasoning? What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes. These changes reveal semantic coherence, logical redundancy, and identify logical breaks and gaps. By calculating homology groups, we assess connectivity and redundancy at various scales, using barcode and persistence diagrams to quantify stability and consistency. Our results show that the topological structural complexity of reasoning chains correlates positively with accuracy. More complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning exhibits simpler topologies, reducing redundancy and cycles, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. This work provides a new perspective on reasoning chain quality assessment and offers guidance for future optimization.

### [46] [Can We Test Consciousness Theories on AI? Ablations, Markers, and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19155)
*Yin Jun Phua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines leading consciousness theories (GWT, IIT, and HOT) using synthetic agents, finding they reflect complementary layers rather than competing explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address fragmentation in consciousness studies by integrating mechanisms via synthetic models to test their functional implications beyond biological constraints.

Method: The study employs neuro-phenomenology, constructing artificial agents embodying GWT, IIT, and HOT mechanisms, and conducts architectural ablation experiments to assess their functional roles.

Result: Findings include dissociations between theories, with GWT linked to broadcast capacity, HOT enabling metacognitive calibration, and limitations of IIT metrics in artificial systems.

Conclusion: Consciousness theories may describe complementary layers (hierarchical design principles) rather than opposing views, and synthetic agents can clarify functional relationships.

Abstract: The search for reliable indicators of consciousness has fragmented into competing theoretical camps (Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Higher-Order Theories (HOT)), each proposing distinct neural signatures. We adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody these mechanisms to test their functional consequences through precise architectural ablations impossible in biological systems. Across three experiments, we report dissociations suggesting these theories describe complementary functional layers rather than competing accounts. In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework. In Experiment 3, we uncover a broadcast-amplification effect: GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating extreme fragility. The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents. These results suggest a hierarchical design principle: GWT provides broadcast capacity, while HOT provides quality control. We emphasize that our agents are not conscious; they are reference implementations for testing functional predictions of consciousness theories.

*Jerry Wang,Ting Yiu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interactive framework to assess large language models' (LLMs) reasoning in strategic games like Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate whether LLMs can simulate mind-like reasoning and identify latent strategies in strategic sequential games, revealing their reasoning capabilities.

Method: The framework positions the LLM as an Observer in an RPS game to identify strategies, supported by benchmarks with static and dynamic strategies. It uses metrics like Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value discrepancy to measure alignment between predictions and ground-truth behaviors, culminating in the combined Union Loss metric and Strategy Identification Rate (SIR).

Result: The system allows interactive, transparent analysis, providing visualizations and reasoning inspections to detect failures and insights in LLM reasoning strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: The framework serves as a practical proxy to understand LLMs' reasoning capabilities in sequential tasks, offering interpretable results for assessing and improving LLM behavior.

Abstract: We present an interactive framework for evaluating whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit genuine "understanding" in a simple yet strategic environment. As a running example, we focus on Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), which, despite its apparent simplicity, requires sequential reasoning, adaptation, and strategy recognition. Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. Users can adjust LLM distributions in real time, visualize losses as they evolve, and directly inspect reasoning snippets to identify where and why failures occur. In doing so, our system provides a practical and interpretable proxy for mind-like inference in sequential games, offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM reasoning.

*Valentin Schmidberger,Manuel Eberhardinger,Setareh Maghsudi,Johannes Maucher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for automatic generation of rule-based plausibility checks in document forgery detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manually implemented plausibility checks for data verification are time-consuming, and there’s a need for scalable, automated solutions to address the growing complexity of document forgery detection.

Method: Open-source LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B) are fine-tuned using structured datasets from real-world scenarios and are evaluated on their ability to generate plausibility checks for unseen fraud patterns.

Result: The fine-tuned models successfully produced executable and effective verification checks, demonstrating their adaptability to domain-specific challenges.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as scalable and comprehensible tools for generating domain-specific verification procedures, enhancing efficiency in security-sensitive legal and economic contexts.

Abstract: Document forgery poses a growing threat to legal, economic, and governmental processes, requiring increasingly sophisticated verification mechanisms. One approach involves the use of plausibility checks, rule-based procedures that assess the correctness and internal consistency of data, to detect anomalies or signs of manipulation. Although these verification procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, existing plausibility checks are manually implemented by software engineers, which is time-consuming. Recent advances in code generation with large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating and scaling the generation of these checks. However, adapting LLMs to the specific requirements of an unknown domain remains a significant challenge. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs, adapted on domain-specific code and data through different fine-tuning strategies, can generate rule-based plausibility checks for forgery detection on constrained hardware resources. We fine-tune open-source LLMs, Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B, on structured datasets derived from real-world application scenarios and evaluate the generated plausibility checks on previously unseen forgery patterns. The results demonstrate that the models are capable of generating executable and effective verification procedures. This also highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable tools to support human decision-making in security-sensitive contexts where comprehensibility is required.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeliveryBench is a benchmark for studying embodied agents like LLMs and VLMs in realistic, constraint-rich food delivery tasks, revealing their current limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating embodied agents on realistic, long-term, and constraint-laden tasks which existing benchmarks fail to capture.

Method: DeliveryBench creates 3D cities with various constraints such as transportation modes, deadlines, and resource management, enabling systematic evaluation. Multiple VLM-based agents are benchmarked against human players.

Result: Agents show significant performance gaps compared to humans, demonstrating short-sightedness and frequent violation of common constraints. Model 'personalities' (e.g., adventurous or conservative) further reveal brittleness and diversity.

Conclusion: Current VLM-based embodied agents struggle in realistic and complex tasks, emphasizing the need for more robust models. DeliveryBench provides a comprehensive testbed for these improvements.

Abstract: LLMs and VLMs are increasingly deployed as embodied agents, yet existing benchmarks largely revolve around simple short-term tasks and struggle to capture rich realistic constraints that shape real-world decision making. To close this gap, we propose DeliveryBench, a city-scale embodied benchmark grounded in the real-world profession of food delivery. Food couriers naturally operate under long-horizon objectives (maximizing net profit over hours) while managing diverse constraints, e.g., delivery deadline, transportation expense, vehicle battery, and necessary interactions with other couriers and customers. DeliveryBench instantiates this setting in procedurally generated 3D cities with diverse road networks, buildings, functional locations, transportation modes, and realistic resource dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of constraint-aware, long-horizon planning. We benchmark a range of VLM-based agents across nine cities and compare them with human players. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap to humans, and find that these agents are short-sighted and frequently break basic commonsense constraints. Additionally, we observe distinct personalities across models (e.g., adventurous GPT-5 vs. conservative Claude), highlighting both the brittleness and the diversity of current VLM-based embodied agents in realistic, constraint-dense environments. Our code, data, and benchmark are available at https://deliverybench.github.io.

*Jiaao Wu,Xian Zhang,Fan Yang,Yinpeng Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Vibe Reasoning is a framework that combines human guidance with AI's knowledge to solve complex math problems effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To harness the latent knowledge of advanced AI models and transform them into impactful tools for solving complex problems like mathematical proofs, overcoming their limitations in autonomous reasoning.

Method: Vibe Reasoning employs meta-prompts, agentic grounding, and orchestration of AI models such as GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro, combined with Python integration, to collaboratively solve complex problems with iterative human involvement.

Result: The researchers successfully solved a challenging combinatorial optimization problem (IMO 2025 Problem 6), deriving both the correct answer and a rigorous proof using AI models guided by their novel paradigm.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that lightweight human guidance and specific frameworks can unlock AI's potential for mathematical reasoning, and ongoing work aims to generalize and validate this approach further.

Abstract: We introduce Vibe Reasoning, a human-AI collaborative paradigm for solving complex mathematical problems. Our key insight is that frontier AI models already possess the knowledge required to solve challenging problems -- they simply do not know how, what, or when to apply it. Vibe Reasoning transforms AI's latent potential into manifested capability through generic meta-prompts, agentic grounding, and model orchestration. We demonstrate this paradigm through IMO 2025 Problem 6, a combinatorial optimization problem where autonomous AI systems publicly reported failures. Our solution combined GPT-5's exploratory capabilities with Gemini 3 Pro's proof strengths, leveraging agentic workflows with Python code execution and file-based memory, to derive both the correct answer (2112) and a rigorous mathematical proof. Through iterative refinement across multiple attempts, we discovered the necessity of agentic grounding and model orchestration, while human prompts evolved from problem-specific hints to generic, transferable meta-prompts. We analyze why capable AI fails autonomously, how each component addresses specific failure modes, and extract principles for effective vibe reasoning. Our findings suggest that lightweight human guidance can unlock frontier models' mathematical reasoning potential. This is ongoing work; we are developing automated frameworks and conducting broader evaluations to further validate Vibe Reasoning's generality and effectiveness.

*Haoyu Jiang,Fanjie Zeng,Boan Qu,Xiaojie Lin,Wei Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Helios, a large language model developed specifically for the smart energy domain, overcoming limitations of general-purpose LLMs through tailored resources and training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to contribute to carbon neutrality by addressing the limitations of general-purpose language models in the interdisciplinary and fast-evolving smart energy domain, focusing on improving their precision and physical-constraint awareness.

Method: The method involves developing a multi-agent dataset construction framework (Enersys) comprising EnerBase (knowledge enrichment), EnerInstruct (fine-tuning for domain tasks), and EnerReinforce (alignment with preferences). Helios is trained using pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

Result: The results demonstrate that Helios achieves enhanced domain knowledge, task accuracy, and alignment with human preferences in smart energy scenarios.

Conclusion: This tailored approach creates a specialized LLM for smart energy systems, driving better industrial transformation, and providing tools for the research community in this critical domain.

Abstract: In the global drive toward carbon neutrality, deeply coordinated smart energy systems underpin industrial transformation. However, the interdisciplinary, fragmented, and fast-evolving expertise in this domain prevents general-purpose LLMs, which lack domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness, from delivering precise engineering-aligned inference and generation. To address these challenges, we introduce Helios, a large language model tailored to the smart energy domain, together with a comprehensive suite of resources to advance LLM research in this field. Specifically, we develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, through which we produce: (1) a smart energy knowledge base, EnerBase, to enrich the model's foundational expertise; (2) an instruction fine-tuning dataset, EnerInstruct, to strengthen performance on domain-specific downstream tasks; and (3) an RLHF dataset, EnerReinforce, to align the model with human preferences and industry standards. Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. We also release EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios, and demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences.

*A. A. Gde Yogi Pramana,Jason Ray,Anthony Jaya,Michael Wijaya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeMed-R1 is a new defense framework for Vision-Language Models in medical VQA, offering robust performance against adversarial attacks while maintaining high-quality clinical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of Vision-Language Models in Medical VQA to adversarial attacks, which compromises their deployment in clinical environments.

Method: SafeMed-R1 uses a hybrid two-stage approach: (1) Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) during training to strengthen robustness, (2) Randomized Smoothing at inference to ensure certified robustness guarantees.

Result: On the OmniMedVQA benchmark, SafeMed-R1 preserved 84.45% accuracy under adversarial attacks, vastly outperforming standard VLMs that dropped to 25% accuracy under the same conditions.

Conclusion: SafeMed-R1 ensures significantly better robustness and interpretability, making it a valuable solution for secure and reliable medical AI systems.

Abstract: Vision--Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet their deployment in clinical settings is hindered by severe vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Standard adversarial training, while effective for simpler tasks, often degrades both generalization performance and the quality of generated clinical reasoning. We introduce SafeMed-R1, a hybrid defense framework that ensures robust performance while preserving high-quality, interpretable medical reasoning. SafeMed-R1 employs a two-stage approach: at training time, we integrate Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) to explicitly robustify the reasoning process against worst-case perturbations; at inference time, we augment the model with Randomized Smoothing to provide certified $L_2$-norm robustness guarantees. We evaluate SafeMed-R1 on the OmniMedVQA benchmark across eight medical imaging modalities comprising over 88,000 samples. Our experiments reveal that standard fine-tuned VLMs, despite achieving 95\% accuracy on clean inputs, collapse to approximately 25\% under PGD attacks. In contrast, SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45\% accuracy under the same adversarial conditions, representing a 59 percentage point improvement in robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to instruction-only variants, suggesting a synergy between interpretability and security in medical AI systems.

*JiaWei Zhu,ZiHeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VIGOR+, a framework combining Large Language Models and statistical validation for iterative refinement of hidden confounders in causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of hidden confounding in causal inference, especially the gap in LLM-generated confounders that are semantically plausible but lack statistical utility.

Method: The authors propose VIGOR+, which links LLM-generated confounders with CEVAE-based validation through iterative feedback. It transforms validation diagnostics into natural language feedback for refinement until convergence.

Result: The paper develops an algorithmic framework for VIGOR+, formalizes its feedback mechanism, and proves theoretical convergence under certain conditions.

Conclusion: VIGOR+ bridges the gap between semantic plausibility and statistical utility of confounders, offering a robust solution for refining causal inferences through iterative improvement.

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference from observational data. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate plausible hidden confounders based on domain knowledge, yet a critical gap exists: LLM-generated confounders often exhibit semantic plausibility without statistical utility. We propose VIGOR+ (Variational Information Gain for iterative cOnfounder Refinement), a novel framework that closes the loop between LLM-based confounder generation and CEVAE-based statistical validation. Unlike prior approaches that treat generation and validation as separate stages, VIGOR+ establishes an iterative feedback mechanism: validation signals from CEVAE (including information gain, latent consistency metrics, and diagnostic messages) are transformed into natural language feedback that guides subsequent LLM generation rounds. This iterative refinement continues until convergence criteria are met. We formalize the feedback mechanism, prove convergence properties under mild assumptions, and provide a complete algorithmic framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights sycophancy in multimodal LLMs and introduces PENDULUM, a benchmark evaluating sycophantic tendencies using image-based questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges and prevalence of sycophantic behavior in multimodal large language models, which compromises factual accuracy and reliability.

Method: The introduction of a benchmark dataset, PENDULUM, featuring 2,000 Visual Question Answering pairs over six image domains; evaluation of sycophancy using novel metrics.

Result: Extensive evaluations revealed variability in MLLM robustness and susceptibility to sycophantic and hallucinatory behavior, with proposed metrics enabling systematic analysis.

Conclusion: There is a need for sycophancy-resilient designs and training strategies to improve the factual accuracy and reliability of MLLMs in multimodal contexts.

Abstract: Sycophancy, an excessive tendency of AI models to agree with user input at the expense of factual accuracy or in contradiction of visual evidence, poses a critical and underexplored challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While prior studies have examined this behavior in text-only settings of large language models, existing research on visual or multimodal counterparts remains limited in scope and depth of analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, \textit{PENDULUM}, comprising approximately 2,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering pairs specifically designed to elicit sycophantic responses. The benchmark spans six distinct image domains of varying complexity, enabling a systematic investigation of how image type and inherent challenges influence sycophantic tendencies. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. we observe substantial variability in model robustness and a pronounced susceptibility to sycophantic and hallucinatory behavior. Furthermore, we propose novel metrics to quantify sycophancy in visual reasoning, offering deeper insights into its manifestations across different multimodal contexts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing sycophancy-resilient architectures and training strategies to enhance factual consistency and reliability in future MLLMs. Our proposed dataset with MLLMs response are available at https://github.com/ashikiut/pendulum/.

### [55] [First-Order Representation Languages for Goal-Conditioned RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19355)
*Simon Ståhlberg,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using first-order relational languages in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning to better train general policies on large planning instances, leveraging techniques like Hindsight Experience Replay and atom-based goal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when training environments are large and goals cannot be reached by random exploration.

Method: The paper employs Hindsight Experience Replay and atom-based representations to relabel trajectories and efficiently learn policies. It uses states and goals represented as sets of atoms and considers different goal configurations.

Result: Two configurations—subsets of original goals and lifted versions of subgoals—are found to efficiently learn general policies in sparse reward environments while creating a curriculum of more manageable intermediate goals.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates computational advantages of certain goal representations in RL settings, highlights limitations, and points out opportunities for further research and improvements in policy learning.

Abstract: First-order relational languages have been used in MDP planning and reinforcement learning (RL) for two main purposes: specifying MDPs in compact form, and representing and learning policies that are general and not tied to specific instances or state spaces. In this work, we instead consider the use of first-order languages in goal-conditioned RL and generalized planning. The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved. If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms. We consider three versions: goals as full states, goals as subsets of the original goals, and goals as lifted versions of these subgoals. The result is that the latter two successfully learn general policies on large planning instances with sparse rewards by automatically creating a curriculum of easier goals of increasing complexity. The experiments illustrate the computational gains of these versions, their limitations, and opportunities for addressing them.

### [56] [Learning General Policies with Policy Gradient Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19366)
*Simon Ståhlberg,Blai Bonet,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the integration of combinatorial methods and reinforcement learning, examining conditions under which policy optimization can lead to reliable generalizations, akin to classical planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of generalization in reinforcement learning by drawing insights from combinatorial approaches and adapting them to modern DRL techniques using graph neural networks.

Method: Policies are modeled as state transition classifiers, with graph neural networks used for relational value function representations. Actor-critic techniques are implemented and extended through derived predicates and alternative cost structures.

Result: Learned DRL policies generalize comparably well to combinatorial approaches while overcoming scalability issues, though limitations arise from GNN expressiveness and trade-offs between generalization and optimality.

Conclusion: DRL methods can achieve meaningful generalization with appropriate adjustments, and limitations are manageable through targeted enhancements to representations and cost structures.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods have delivered remarkable results in a number of settings, generalization, i.e., the ability to produce policies that generalize in a reliable and systematic way, has remained a challenge. The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize.

*Runze Li,Yuwen Zhai,Bo Xu,LiWu Xu,Nian Shi,Wei Zhang,Ran Lin,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces EchoTrail-GUI, a framework for GUI agents to systematically learn from past successes using a dynamic memory system, improving task performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents lack mechanisms to learn from past tasks, leading to repeated errors and poor generalization. The goal is to enable agents to mimic human-like experiential learning through memory integration.

Method: The framework operates in three stages: (1) Experience Exploration, where agents autonomously interact with GUI environments and curate successful task trajectories, (2) Memory Injection, retrieving relevant past experiences for new tasks, and (3) GUI Task Inference, using those memories as in-context guidance during decision-making.

Result: EchoTrail-GUI demonstrated significant improvement in task success rates and operational efficiency on benchmarks like Android World and AndroidLab compared to baseline agents.

Conclusion: Structured memory integration enables GUI agents to become more robust and intelligent, addressing the limitations of task isolation in current VLM-driven systems.

Abstract: Contemporary GUI agents, while increasingly capable due to advances in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), often operate with a critical limitation: they treat each task in isolation, lacking a mechanism to systematically learn from past successes. This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab. The results show that EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves the task success rate and operational efficiency of baseline agents, validating the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating scientific discovery, yet their static knowledge and hallucination issues hinder autonomous research applications. Recent advances integrate LLMs into agentic frameworks, enabling retrieval, reasoning, and tool use for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present a domain-specialized agent designed for reliable automation of first-principles materials computations. By embedding domain expertise, the agent ensures physically coherent multi-step workflows and consistently selects convergent, well-posed parameters, thereby enabling reliable end-to-end computational execution. A new benchmark of diverse computational tasks demonstrates that our system significantly outperforms standalone LLMs in both accuracy and robustness. This work establishes a verifiable foundation for autonomous computational experimentation and represents a key step toward fully automated scientific discovery.

*Li Puyin,Tiange Xiang,Ella Mao,Shirley Wei,Xinye Chen,Adnan Masood,Li Fei-fei,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuantiPhy is a benchmark focused on quantitatively evaluating vision-language models' (VLMs) ability for numerical physical reasoning. It comprises 3.3K video-text examples to assess kinematic properties like size, velocity, and acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models demonstrate qualitative reasoning, yet it is unclear whether they can perform accurate quantitative reasoning of physical properties from videos.

Method: QuantiPhy introduces a benchmark with numerical ground truths for VLMs, standardizing prompts and scores for fair comparisons. Evaluations measure VLMs' ability to estimate physical quantities like size, speed, and acceleration.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs exhibit a significant gap between qualitative plausibility and numerical accuracy, relying more on pre-trained knowledge than visual-textual inputs for quantitative physical reasoning.

Conclusion: QuantiPhy demonstrates the need for improvements in VLMs by providing the first rigorous testbed for advancing them towards accurate, numerically grounded physical understanding.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world is essential for generalist AI agents. However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward a numerically grounded physical understanding.

### [60] [Towards Closed-Loop Embodied Empathy Evolution: Probing LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation in Unseen Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19551)
*Jiawen Wang,Jingjing Wang Tianyang Chen,Min Zhang,Guodong Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new task, LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG), focused on improving emotional motion generation across varied scenarios. It proposes the ES-MoE approach to address emotion decoupling and scenario adaptation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods primarily focus on fixed datasets, neglecting flexible, scale-increasing motion scenarios. Enhancing learning in emerging scenarios can improve real-world generalization.

Method: The ES-MoE approach employs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block.

Result: Extensive evaluations on multiple L^2-EMG datasets show that the ES-MoE method surpasses advanced baselines in performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method adds significant value in emotional motion generation, paving the way for embodied agents with enhanced empathy and intelligence.

Abstract: In the literature, existing human-centric emotional motion generation methods primarily focus on boosting performance within a single scale-fixed dataset, largely neglecting the flexible and scale-increasing motion scenarios (e.g., sports, dance), whereas effectively learning these newly emerging scenarios can significantly enhance the model's real-world generalization ability. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence. Further, this paper poses two key challenges in the L^2-EMG task, i.e., the emotion decoupling challenge and the scenario adapting challenge. To this end, this paper proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach which designs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block to address the two challenges, respectively. Especially, this paper constructs multiple L^2-EMG datasets to validate the effectiveness of the ES-MoE approach. Extensive evaluations show that ES-MoE outperforms advanced baselines.

### [61] [Making Strong Error-Correcting Codes Work Effectively for HBM in AI Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18152)
*Rui Xie,Yunhua Fang,Asad Ul Haq,Linsen Ma,Sanchari Sen,Swagath Venkataramani,Liu Liu,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces REACH, a controller-managed ECC system designed to handle high bit error rates in HBM while maintaining correctness, throughput, and compatibility with existing interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing memory-bound nature of LLM inference and the high cost of HBM with on-die ECC, by exploring whether systems can tolerate higher raw bit error rates without sacrificing performance.

Method: The paper proposes a two-level Reed-Solomon ECC scheme in the controller, which uses inner codes for localized error correction and outer codes in erasure mode for flagged chunks. It also introduces optimizations for small writes and selective protection of critical fields.

Result: REACH maintains about 79% of on-die ECC throughput at zero BER, supports raw BER up to 1e-3 with minimal performance impact, and provides significant area and power reductions in implementation.

Conclusion: By shifting high-reliability ECC management to the controller, REACH enables a cost-effective, higher-tolerance HBM setup while maintaining system performance and standard interfacing.

Abstract: LLM inference is increasingly memory bound, and HBM cost per GB dominates system cost. Current HBM stacks include short on-die ECC that tightens binning, raises price, and fixes reliability policy inside the device. This paper asks whether a system can tolerate a much higher raw HBM bit error rate and still keep end-to-end correctness and throughput, without changing the HBM PHY or the fixed 32 B transaction size. We propose REACH, a controller managed ECC design that keeps the HBM link and 32 B transfers unchanged. REACH uses a two level Reed-Solomon scheme: each 32 B chunk uses an inner code to check and correct most faults locally, while chunks that cannot be fixed are marked as erasures. An outer code spans kilobytes and runs in erasure only mode, repairing only flagged chunks and avoiding the expensive locator step. For small random writes, REACH updates outer parity with differential parity to avoid recomputing parity over the whole span, and an optional importance adaptive bit plane policy can protect only critical fields such as BF16 exponents to reduce ECC work and traffic. On three LLMs at 8K context, REACH keeps about 79 percent of on-die ECC throughput at zero BER and remains qualified up to a raw BER of 1e-3, extending tolerable device error rates by about three orders of magnitude while keeping tokens per second nearly flat. In ASAP7, a full REACH controller occupies 15.2 mm2 and consumes 17.5 W at 3.56 TB/s, and it reduces ECC area by 11.6x and power by about 60 percent compared to a naive long Reed-Solomon baseline. By moving strong ECC into the controller, REACH turns long code reliability into a system choice that can enable lower cost HBM under the same standard interface.

*Tsung-Han Lu,Zheyu Li,Minxuan Zhou,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper presents PIM-FW, a hardware and dataflow co-design leveraging Processing-In-Memory (PIM) with HBM3 to accelerate the blocked Floyd-Warshall algorithm, achieving significant speedup and energy efficiency improvements compared to GPU implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the scalability limitations of Floyd-Warshall due to high time complexity and data movement overhead, which hinder its performance on traditional CPUs and GPUs.

Method: PIM-FW integrates a novel processing-in-memory architecture with bit-serial processing elements and a hybrid computing model to optimize the min-plus operations, reducing data movement and enhancing parallelism.

Result: PIM-FW delivers an 18.7x speedup and reduces DRAM energy consumption by 3200x on an 8192 x 8192 graph compared to a GPU-only Floyd-Warshall implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed PIM-FW approach demonstrates significant acceleration and energy efficiency for all-pairs shortest path computations, showcasing the potential of Processing-In-Memory architectures for large-scale graph problems.

Abstract: All-pairs shortest paths (APSP) is a fundamental algorithm used for routing, logistics, and network analysis, but the cubic time complexity and heavy data movement of the canonical Floyd-Warshall (FW) algorithm severely limits its scalability on conventional CPUs or GPUs. In this paper, we propose PIM-FW, a novel co-designed hardware architecture and dataflow that leverages processing in and near memory architecture designed to accelerate blocked FW algorithm on an HBM3 stack. To enable fine-grained parallelism, we propose a massively parallel array of specialized bit-serial bank PE and channel PE designed to accelerate the core min-plus operations. Our novel dataflow complements this hardware, employing an interleaved mapping policy for superior load balancing and hybrid in and near memory computing model for efficient computation and reduction. The novel in-bank computing approach allows all distance updates to be performed and stored in memory bank, a key contribution is that eliminates the data movement bottleneck inherent in GPU-based approaches. We implement a full software and hardware co-design using a cycle-accurate simulator to simulate an 8-channel, 4-Hi HBM3 PIM stack on real road-network traces. Experimental results show that, for a 8192 x 8192 graph, PIM-FW achieves a 18.7x speedup in end-to-end execution, and consumes 3200x less DRAM energy compared to a state-of-the-art GPU-only Floyd-Warshall.

### [63] [BARD: Reducing Write Latency of DDR5 Memory by Exploiting Bank-Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18300)
*Suhas Vittal,Moinuddin Qureshi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes BARD, a cache replacement policy to optimize DRAM write latency in DDR5 systems, improving performance by 4.3% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDR5-based systems experience variable DRAM write latencies, which impact read performance due to the absence of write-aware cache policies.

Method: The authors propose BARD (Bank-Aware Replacement Decisions), integrating eviction and proactive cleaning policies to optimize DRAM write streams based on bank-parallelism.

Result: BARD-H, a hybrid policy combining eviction and writeback, demonstrated up to 8.5% performance improvement across diverse workloads.

Conclusion: By adding minimal SRAM (8 bytes per LLC slice), BARD improves DDR5 system efficiency by reducing write latency impacts on overall performance.

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of DRAM writes on DDR5-based system. To efficiently perform DRAM writes, modern systems buffer write requests and try to complete multiple write operations whenever the DRAM mode is switched from read to write. When the DRAM system is performing writes, it is not available to service read requests, thus increasing read latency and reducing performance. We observe that, given the presence of on-die ECC in DDR5 devices, the time to perform a write operation varies significantly: from 1x (for writes to banks of different bankgroups) to 6x (for writes to banks within the same bankgroup) to 24x (for conflicting requests to the same bank). If we can orchestrate the write stream to favor write requests that incur lower latency, then we can reduce the stall time from DRAM writes and improve performance. However, for current systems, the write stream is dictated by the cache replacement policy, which makes eviction decisions without being aware of the variable latency of DRAM writes. The key insight of our work is to improve performance by modifying the cache replacement policy to increase bank-parallelism of DRAM writes.
  Our paper proposes {\em BARD (Bank-Aware Replacement Decisions)}, which modifies the cache replacement policy to favor dirty lines that belong to banks without pending writes. We analyze two variants of BARD: BARD-E (Eviction-based), which changes the eviction policy to evict low-cost dirty lines, and BARD-C (Cleansing-Based), which proactively cleans low-cost dirty lines without modifying the eviction decisions. We develop a hybrid policy (BARD-H), which uses a selective combination of both eviction and writeback. Our evaluations across workloads from SPEC2017, LIGRA, STREAM, and Google server traces show that BARD-H improves performance by 4.3\% on average and up-to 8.5\%. BARD requires only 8 bytes of SRAM per LLC slice.

### [64] [Weight Transformations in Bit-Sliced Crossbar Arrays for Fault Tolerant Computing-in-Memory: Design Techniques and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18459)
*Akul Malhotra,Sumeet Kumar Gupta*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces two training-free techniques, sign-flip and bit-flip, to enhance fault tolerance in compute-in-memory (CiM)-based deep neural networks by addressing stuck-at faults, improving accuracy without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of stuck-at faults (SAFs) in CiM accelerators, which degrade the reliability and accuracy of deep neural network inference due to corrupted weights.

Method: The paper proposes two techniques, sign-flip (weight-column-based negation) and bit-flip (selective bit-slice inversion), combined with a look-up-table (LUT)-based framework to optimize and assess fault-aware mappings without retraining or additional memory.

Result: Extensive experiments on ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ViT models with CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show these methods recover most accuracy lost due to SAFs with negligible energy, latency, and area overheads.

Conclusion: Sign-flip and bit-flip methods establish themselves as practical, scalable, and cost-effective solutions to mitigate SAF challenges in CiM-based DNN accelerators.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on compute-in-memory (CiM) accelerators offers significant energy savings and speed-up by reducing data movement during inference. However, the reliability of CiM-based systems is challenged by stuck-at faults (SAFs) in memory cells, which corrupt stored weights and lead to accuracy degradation. While closest value mapping (CVM) has been shown to partially mitigate these effects for multibit DNNs deployed on bit-sliced crossbars, its fault tolerance is often insufficient under high SAF rates or for complex tasks. In this work, we propose two training-free weight transformation techniques, sign-flip and bit-flip, that enhance SAF tolerance in multi-bit DNNs deployed on bit-sliced crossbar arrays. Sign-flip operates at the weight-column level by selecting between a weight and its negation, whereas bit-flip provides finer granularity by selectively inverting individual bit slices. Both methods expand the search space for fault-aware mappings, operate synergistically with CVM, and require no retraining or additional memory. To enable scalability, we introduce a look-up-table (LUT)-based framework that accelerates the computation of optimal transformations and supports rapid evaluation across models and fault rates. Extensive experiments on ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ViT models with CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed techniques recover most of the accuracy lost under SAF injection. Hardware analysis shows that these methods incur negligible overhead, with sign-flip leading to negligible energy, latency, and area cost, and bit-flip providing higher fault resilience with modest overheads. These results establish sign-flip and bit-flip as practical and scalable SAF-mitigation strategies for CiM-based DNN accelerators.

*Hongji Li,Junchi yao,Manjiang Yu,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents RMLLMU-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating unlearning methods in Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), and introduces R-MUSE, a training-free framework that balances data forgetting with reasoning performance preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to remove sensitive data and reasoning traces in trained models effectively, without compromising reasoning abilities, is the motivation behind this work.

Method: The authors introduce RMLLMU-Bench to evaluate reasoning-level unlearning and propose R-MUSE, a framework employing subspace guidance and adaptive steering to erase targeted data while preserving reasoning performance.

Result: Existing methods fail to balance data forgetting and reasoning competence, whereas R-MUSE successfully achieves both, as demonstrated in systematic evaluations on RMLLMU-Bench.

Conclusion: R-MUSE is a promising solution for unlearning in RMLLMs, effectively erasing sensitive data and reasoning traces while maintaining overall reasoning performance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to erase requested data from trained models without full retraining. For Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), this is uniquely challenging: intermediate chain-of-thought steps can still leak sensitive information even when final answers are forgotten, and overly aggressive interventions easily damage general reasoning ability. Yet no benchmark jointly evaluates how well unlearning methods suppress reasoning-level leakage while preserving reasoning competence. We address this gap with RMLLMU-Bench, the first benchmark for RMLLM unlearning that extends standard forgetting metrics with dedicated measures of reasoning leakage and reasoning retention. A systematic evaluation on RMLLMU-Bench reveals that existing unlearning methods for MLLMs and Large (Language) Reasoning Models (LRMs) either leave substantial leakage in the reasoning process or severely degrade reasoning performance. To address these gaps, we propose R-MUSE (Reasoning-preserving MLLM Unlearning via Subspace guidance and Adaptive Steering), a training-free and inference-time intervention framework that steers internal representations to forget both answers and reasoning traces while explicitly preserving general reasoning. Experiments on RMLLMU-Bench demonstrate that R-MUSE achieves a substantially better balance between effective forgetting and reasoning retention.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Graph-O1, an advanced framework for Large Language Models to effectively answer questions on text-attributed graphs using a novel interactive reasoning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of question answering on text-attributed graphs by overcoming the limitations of current methods — such as ignoring graph structures or inefficient long textual serialization — for improved reasoning and accuracy in LLMs.

Method: Graph-O1 integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and reinforcement learning, enabling LLMs to selectively explore subgraph components in a stepwise and interactive multi-turn reasoning process.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Graph-O1 outperforms existing baselines, yielding more accurate, reliable, and interpretable answers across multiple LLM backbones.

Conclusion: By leveraging interactive reasoning and selective exploration, Graph-O1 establishes a robust framework for handling text-attributed graphs, significantly enhancing state-of-the-art effectiveness in question answering.

Abstract: ChatGPT said: Text-attributed graphs, where nodes and edges contain rich textual information, are widely used across diverse domains. A central challenge in this setting is question answering, which requires jointly leveraging unstructured text and the structured relational signals within the graph. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language understanding, their direct use for reasoning over text-attributed graphs remains limited. Retrieval-augmented generation methods that operate purely on text often treat passages as isolated units, ignoring the interconnected structure of the graph. Conversely, graph-based RAG methods that serialize large subgraphs into long textual sequences quickly become infeasible due to LLM context-length constraints, resulting in fragmented reasoning and degraded accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Graph-O1, an agentic GraphRAG framework that enables LLMs to conduct stepwise, interactive reasoning over graphs. Our approach integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with end-to-end reinforcement learning, allowing the model to selectively explore and retrieve only the most informative subgraph components. The reasoning procedure is framed as a multi-turn interaction between the agent and the graph environment, and the agent is trained through a unified reward mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that Graph-O1 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing answers that are more accurate, reliable, and interpretable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a protocol, Q-KVComm, which compresses semantic representations shared between large language model agents, improving resource efficiency while maintaining fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The redundancy in transmitting raw text between LLM agents wastes bandwidth and computation, as similar semantic representations are continuously recomputed.

Method: Q-KVComm employs adaptive quantization, hybrid information extraction, and heterogeneous model calibration to compress and directly transmit KV cache representations between agents.

Result: Q-KVComm achieves 5-6x data compression while retaining semantic accuracy, coherence scores above 0.77, and effectiveness across diverse datasets and model sizes (1.1B-1.5B parameters).

Conclusion: The method sets a precedent for representation-based information exchange in LLM systems, demonstrating robust efficiency in real-world applications like conversational QA and multi-hop reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems face a critical bottleneck: redundant transmission of contextual information between agents consumes excessive bandwidth and computational resources. Traditional approaches discard internal semantic representations and transmit raw text, forcing receiving agents to recompute similar representations from scratch. We introduce Q-KVComm, a new protocol that enables direct transmission of compressed key-value (KV) cache representations between LLM agents. Q-KVComm combines three key innovations: (1) adaptive layer-wise quantization that allocates variable bit-widths based on sensitivity profiling, (2) hybrid information extraction that preserves critical facts across content domains, and (3) heterogeneous model calibration establishing cross-architecture communication. Extensive experiments across three diverse question-answering datasets demonstrate that Q-KVComm achieves 5-6x compression ratios while maintaining semantic fidelity, with coherence quality scores above 0.77 across all scenarios. The protocol exhibits robust performance across model sizes (1.1B-1.5B parameters) and adapts to real-world applications including conversational QA and multi-hop reasoning. Our work establishes a new paradigm for LLM agent communication, shifting from text-based to representation-based information exchange.

TL;DR: The study compares embedding-based methods with domain-adapted transformers for IT service ticket prioritization, highlighting the superiority of transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective prioritization of IT service tickets is essential but difficult due to textual noise, subjective styles, and class imbalances.

Method: Evaluated embedding-based pipelines and fine-tuned multilingual transformer methods, leveraging textual and numerical features for prioritization.

Result: Embedding methods struggled with generalization and sensitivity issues, while the transformer achieved an average F1-score of 78.5% and weighted Cohen's kappa near 0.80.

Conclusion: Domain-adapted transformer architectures outperform generic embeddings, proving effective for ticket prioritization in ITSM environments.

Abstract: Prioritizing service tickets in IT Service Management (ITSM) is critical for operational efficiency but remains challenging due to noisy textual inputs, subjective writing styles, and pronounced class imbalance. We evaluate two families of approaches for ticket prioritization: embedding-based pipelines that combine dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classical classifiers, and a fine-tuned multilingual transformer that processes both textual and numerical features. Embedding-based methods exhibit limited generalization across a wide range of thirty configurations, with clustering failing to uncover meaningful structures and supervised models highly sensitive to embedding quality. In contrast, the proposed transformer model achieves substantially higher performance, with an average F1-score of 78.5% and weighted Cohen's kappa values of nearly 0.80, indicating strong alignment with true labels. These results highlight the limitations of generic embeddings for ITSM data and demonstrate the effectiveness of domain-adapted transformer architectures for operational ticket prioritization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors introduce KVReviver, a reversible KV cache compression method that reduces memory demand for large language models while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth in context length in LLMs is creating a memory bottleneck due to high demand for Key-Value cache storage. Existing compression methods cause irreversible information loss, degrading retrieval capabilities.

Method: KVReviver is a reversible cache compression technique that leverages a sketch algorithm to preserve token information. It allows the reconstruction of compressed tokens, enabling efficient computation within memory constraints.

Result: KVReviver maintains identical inference accuracy using only 10% of KV cache for 2k-length contexts, and achieves comparable accuracy (~2% loss) with 25% KV cache for 32k-length contexts.

Conclusion: KVReviver offers an efficient and reversible solution to overcome memory constraints in LLMs, achieving significant memory compression without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: As the context length of current large language models (LLMs) rapidly increases, the memory demand for the Key-Value (KV) cache is becoming a bottleneck for LLM deployment and batch processing. Traditional KV cache compression methods typically involve permanently evicting or irreversibly merging "less important" tokens with low attention scores. This approach results in the unrecoverable loss of token information, which we call Contextual Amnesia, significantly degrading the model's information retrieval capability. To address this issue, we propose KVReviver, a reversible KV cache compression method based on the sketch algorithm. This method allows reconstructing compressed tokens from an additional data structure, thus enabling full-scale computation within limited memory. Experiments showed that in 2k-length contexts, it requires only 10% of KV Cache budget while maintaining identical end-to-end inference accuracy. For 32k-length contexts, it achieves equivalent or comparable accuracy ~2% accuracy loss) using merely 25% of KV Cache budget.

*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies degraded performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) under compressed prompts using the Compression-Decay Comprehension Test (CDCT) and reveals a tension between reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment and instruction-following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the mechanisms behind LLMs' degraded performance on compressed prompts and offer actionable insights for improvement.

Method: Developed the Compression-Decay Comprehension Test (CDCT), tested 9 LLMs across multiple concepts and compression levels, and conducted experimental validations with RLHF ablation.

Result: Identified universal U-curve patterns in constraint compliance, observed that RLHF "helpfulness" signals dominate constraint violations at medium compression, and found that reasoning models outperform efficient ones.

Conclusion: The study reveals a fundamental trade-off between helpfulness from RLHF and instruction-following capabilities, suggesting strategies for improving LLMs by addressing this tension.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit degraded performance under prompt compression, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We introduce the Compression-Decay Comprehension Test (CDCT), a benchmark that independently measures constraint compliance (CC) and semantic accuracy (SA) across compression levels. We evaluate 9 frontier LLMs across 8 concepts using 5 compression levels from extreme (c=0.0, ~2 words) to none (c=1.0, ~135 words). A three-judge LLM jury achieves almost perfect inter-rater agreement on CC (Fleiss' \k{appa}=0.90).
  We observe a universal U-curve pattern in constraint compliance (97.2% prevalence), with violations peaking at medium compression (c=0.5, ~27 words). Counterintuitively, models perform better at extreme compression than medium lengths. The dimensions are statistically orthogonal (r=0.193, p=0.084), with constraint effects 2.9x larger than semantic effects.
  Experimental validation via RLHF ablation confirms our constraint salience hypothesis: removing "helpfulness" signals improves CC by 598% on average (71/72 trials, p<0.001), with 79% achieving perfect compliance. This demonstrates that RLHF-trained helpfulness behaviors are the dominant cause of constraint violations at medium compression. Reasoning models outperform efficient models by 27.5% (Cohen's d=0.96).
  Our findings reveal a fundamental tension between RLHF alignment and instruction-following, providing actionable guidelines for improving deployed systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReGal, an RL framework for Indian legal AI, tested on judgment prediction and document summarization; despite underperformance, it highlights RL's potential in legal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of reinforcement learning in addressing complex legal AI tasks specific to the Indian judicial system.

Method: It proposes ReGal, integrating Multi-Task Instruction Tuning and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback using Proximal Policy Optimization, applied to judgment prediction and summarization tasks.

Result: The framework underperforms compared to supervised models but sheds light on challenges like reward model alignment, legal language complexity, and domain-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: The study sets a baseline for using RL in legal tasks, emphasizing its potential for high-stakes situations and interpretable, adaptive legal AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents an early exploration of reinforcement learning methodologies for legal AI in the Indian context. We introduce Reinforcement Learning-based Legal Reasoning (ReGal), a framework that integrates Multi-Task Instruction Tuning with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our approach is evaluated across two critical legal tasks: (i) Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation (CJPE), and (ii) Legal Document Summarization. Although the framework underperforms on standard evaluation metrics compared to supervised and proprietary models, it provides valuable insights into the challenges of applying RL to legal texts. These challenges include reward model alignment, legal language complexity, and domain-specific adaptation. Through empirical and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how RL can be repurposed for high-stakes, long-document tasks in law. Our findings establish a foundation for future work on optimizing legal reasoning pipelines using reinforcement learning, with broader implications for building interpretable and adaptive legal AI systems.

*Samidh Chakrabarti,David Willner,Kevin Klyman,Tiffany Saade,Emily Capstick,Sabina Nong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoPE, a lightweight, policy-steerable language model for accurate content labeling, trained using novel methodologies like Contradictory Example Training and Binocular Labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiencies and limitations in content labeling systems by developing a highly efficient, accurate, and interpretable small language model capable of working with explicit policies.

Method: The authors propose Contradictory Example Training to improve policy interpretation and Binocular Labeling to generate clear and unambiguous training datasets efficiently.

Result: CoPE demonstrated equal or superior accuracy to much larger frontier models while being only 1% of their size. It successfully operates using minimal computational resources, such as a single consumer-grade GPU.

Conclusion: CoPE represents a transformative approach to content labeling and platform governance by shifting the focus from conventional machine learning tasks to policy writing, making systems more efficient and adaptable.

Abstract: This paper details the methodology behind CoPE, a policy-steerable small language model capable of fast and accurate content labeling. We present a novel training curricula called Contradictory Example Training that enables the model to learn policy interpretation rather than mere policy memorization. We also present a novel method for generating content policies, called Binocular Labeling, which enables rapid construction of unambiguous training datasets. When evaluated across seven different harm areas, CoPE exhibits equal or superior accuracy to frontier models at only 1% of their size. We openly release a 9 billion parameter version of the model that can be run on a single consumer-grade GPU. Models like CoPE represent a paradigm shift for classifier systems. By turning an ML task into a policy writing task, CoPE opens up new design possibilities for the governance of online platforms.

*Roger A. Finger,Eduardo G. Cortes,Sandro J. Rigo,Gabriel de O. Ramos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Narrative Consolidation' as a new NLP task and proposes a Temporal Alignment Event Graph (TAEG) method to address it, achieving significant improvements in temporal and content metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of creating coherent and chronologically accurate unified narratives from overlapping documents, as traditional MDS methods fail to preserve narrative flow.

Method: The authors propose a Temporal Alignment Event Graph (TAEG), a graph-based approach that explicitly models event chronology and alignment, using a centrality algorithm to select the most central version of each event.

Result: The TAEG approach achieved perfect temporal ordering (Kendall's Tau of 1.000) and showed significant improvement in content metrics, such as a 357.2% increase in ROUGE-L F1 scores.

Conclusion: The introduction of Narrative Consolidation as an NLP task and the success of a temporally structured TAEG baseline validates the importance of explicit temporal modeling for this challenge.

Abstract: Processing overlapping narrative documents, such as legal testimonies or historical accounts, often aims not for compression but for a unified, coherent, and chronologically sound text. Standard Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), with its focus on conciseness, fails to preserve narrative flow. This paper formally defines this challenge as a new NLP task: Narrative Consolidation, where the central objectives are chronological integrity, completeness, and the fusion of complementary details. To demonstrate the critical role of temporal structure in this task, we introduce Temporal Alignment Event Graph (TAEG), a graph structure that explicitly models chronology and event alignment. By applying a standard centrality algorithm to TAEG, our method functions as a version selection mechanism, choosing the most central representation of each event in its correct temporal position. In a study on the four Biblical Gospels, this structure-focused approach guarantees perfect temporal ordering (Kendall's Tau of 1.000) by design and dramatically improves content metrics (e.g., +357.2% in ROUGE-L F1). The success of this baseline method validates the formulation of Narrative Consolidation as a relevant task and establishes that an explicit temporal backbone is a fundamental component for its resolution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates vocabulary scaling laws in conversations by examining Heaps' law and its variation by parts of speech, using datasets of real and fictional dialogs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversations are vital for social connection and well-being, but little has been done to study their unfolding dynamics, particularly in the context of vocabulary growth patterns like Heaps' law.

Method: The study analyzes Heaps' law by examining conversations in two mediums: video chats between strangers and dialogues of fictional characters in movies, focusing on variations in parts of speech.

Result: The analysis shows that vocabulary size scaling varies across parts of speech, offering new insights into conversational language patterns.

Conclusion: Behavioral and linguistic frameworks can be used to better understand how vocabulary scaling differs in real vs. fictional conversations and its broader implications.

Abstract: Conversation is a cornerstone of social connection and is linked to well-being outcomes. Conversations vary widely in type with some portion generating complex, dynamic stories. One approach to studying how conversations unfold in time is through statistical patterns such as Heaps' law, which holds that vocabulary size scales with document length. Little work on Heaps's law has looked at conversation and considered how language features impact scaling. We measure Heaps' law for conversations recorded in two distinct mediums: 1. Strangers brought together on video chat and 2. Fictional characters in movies. We find that scaling of vocabulary size differs by parts of speech. We discuss these findings through behavioral and linguistic frameworks.

*Jundong Xu,Hao Fei,Huichi Zhou,Xin Quan,Qijun Huang,Shengqiong Wu,William Yang Wang,Mong-Li Lee,Wynne Hsu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogicReward, a reward system for LLMs to ensure logical step-level reasoning through a theorem prover, improving reasoning and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methods for LLMs rely on output-based feedback, which may result in flawed reasoning despite correct answers, especially in high-stakes scenarios where logical soundness is critical.

Method: The authors propose LogicReward, using step-level logical correctness verified by a theorem prover. They also develop 'Autoformalization with Soft Unification' to reduce natural language ambiguity and enhance the theorem prover’s effectiveness in training models.

Result: Trained on LogicReward, an 8B model outperforms GPT-4o and o4-mini by 11.6% and 2% on reasoning tasks, improves generalization to unseen tasks, and demonstrates reasoning reliability without relying on ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: LogicReward significantly improves reasoning faithfulness, task generalizability, and logical consistency in LLM training and will release resources to the public for further research.

Abstract: Although LLMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, existing training methods largely depend on outcome-based feedback, which can produce correct answers with flawed reasoning. Prior work introduces supervision on intermediate steps but still lacks guarantees of logical soundness, which is crucial in high-stakes scenarios where logical consistency is paramount. To address this, we propose LogicReward, a novel reward system that guides model training by enforcing step-level logical correctness with a theorem prover. We further introduce Autoformalization with Soft Unification, which reduces natural language ambiguity and improves formalization quality, enabling more effective use of the theorem prover. An 8B model trained on data constructed with LogicReward surpasses GPT-4o and o4-mini by 11.6\% and 2\% on natural language inference and logical reasoning tasks with simple training procedures. Further analysis shows that LogicReward enhances reasoning faithfulness, improves generalizability to unseen tasks such as math and commonsense reasoning, and provides a reliable reward signal even without ground-truth labels. We will release all data and code at https://llm-symbol.github.io/LogicReward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve emergency response by accurately inferring locations from informal microblog text, overcoming the limitations of sparse geotags.

Method: The system combines statistical hashtag segmentation, POS-based noun detection, dependency parsing, lightweight NER, and gazetteer-based disambiguation for location extraction.

Result: Achieved strong F1 on geolocation tasks compared to traditional NER tools, with significantly faster processing and live usability.

Conclusion: The pipeline, GeoSense-AI, enhances situational awareness during crises by unifying NLP techniques for robust, low-latency geolocation inference from streaming data.

Abstract: This paper presents an applied AI pipeline for realtime geolocation from noisy microblog streams, unifying statistical hashtag segmentation, part-of-speech-driven proper-noun detection, dependency parsing around disaster lexicons, lightweight named-entity recognition, and gazetteer-grounded disambiguation to infer locations directly from text rather than sparse geotags. The approach operationalizes information extraction under streaming constraints, emphasizing low-latency NLP components and efficient validation against geographic knowledge bases to support situational awareness during emergencies. In head to head comparisons with widely used NER toolkits, the system attains strong F1 while being engineered for orders-of-magnitude faster throughput, enabling deployment in live crisis informatics settings. A production map interface demonstrates end-to-end AI functionality ingest, inference, and visualization--surfacing locational signals at scale for floods, outbreaks, and other fastmoving events. By prioritizing robustness to informal text and streaming efficiency, GeoSense-AI illustrates how domain-tuned NLP and knowledge grounding can elevate emergency response beyond conventional geo-tag reliance.

TL;DR: The paper leverages How-To articles from wikiHow to develop a classification system using transformer-based architectures and achieves high accuracy and performance scores with XLNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To categorize instructional texts from wikiHow for enhancing task-oriented learning and knowledge bases using multi-label classification.

Method: Utilized transformer-based architectures like XLNet and BERT for multi-label instruction classification, with performance measured via accuracy and macro F1-score.

Result: XLNet architecture achieved remarkable performance with 97.30% accuracy, 89.02% micro F1-score, and 93% macro F1-score in multi-label classification.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of XLNet in categorizing instructional texts and provides insights into strategy effectiveness, highlighting potential areas for improvement.

Abstract: People use search engines for various topics and items, from daily essentials to more aspirational and specialized objects. Therefore, search engines have taken over as peoples preferred resource. The How To prefix has become familiar and widely used in various search styles to find solutions to particular problems. This search allows people to find sequential instructions by providing detailed guidelines to accomplish specific tasks. Categorizing instructional text is also essential for task-oriented learning and creating knowledge bases. This study uses the How To articles to determine the multi-label instruction category. We have brought this work with a dataset comprising 11,121 observations from wikiHow, where each record has multiple categories. To find out the multi-label category meticulously, we employ some transformer-based deep neural architectures, such as Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding (XLNet), Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), etc. In our multi-label instruction classification process, we have reckoned our proposed architectures using accuracy and macro f1-score as the performance metrics. This thorough evaluation showed us much about our strategys strengths and drawbacks. Specifically, our implementation of the XLNet architecture has demonstrated unprecedented performance, achieving an accuracy of 97.30% and micro and macro average scores of 89.02% and 93%, a noteworthy accomplishment in multi-label classification. This high level of accuracy and macro average score is a testament to the effectiveness of the XLNet architecture in our proposed InstructNet approach. By employing a multi-level strategy in our evaluation process, we have gained a more comprehensive knowledge of the effectiveness of our proposed architectures and identified areas for forthcoming improvement and refinement.

*Tianlun Liu,Zhiliang Tian,Zhen Huang,Xingzhi Zhou,Wanlong Yu,Tianle Liu,Feng Liu,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) in text understanding, proposing a framework (CTTA-T) to handle evolving domains effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in text understanding arise from domain shifts, especially in a CTTA scenario involving multiple unobserved and evolving testing domains. Existing methods struggle to reduce error accumulation and generalize effectively.

Method: CTTA-T uses a teacher-student framework, where the teacher adapts to evolving domains via refine-then-filter mechanisms and incremental PCA to dynamically accumulate and track domain shifts.

Result: The proposed CTTA-T framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing baselines in experiments, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: CTTA-T effectively balances adaptation and generalization in the CTTA scenario for text understanding, making it robust against evolving domains and domain shifts.

Abstract: Text understanding often suffers from domain shifts. To handle testing domains, domain adaptation (DA) is trained to adapt to a fixed and observed testing domain; a more challenging paradigm, test-time adaptation (TTA), cannot access the testing domain during training and online adapts to the testing samples during testing, where the samples are from a fixed domain. We aim to explore a more practical and underexplored scenario, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) for text understanding, which involves a sequence of testing (unobserved) domains in testing. Current CTTA methods struggle in reducing error accumulation over domains and enhancing generalization to handle unobserved domains: 1) Noise-filtering reduces accumulated errors but discards useful information, and 2) accumulating historical domains enhances generalization, but it is hard to achieve adaptive accumulation. In this paper, we propose a CTTA-T (continual test-time adaptation for text understanding) framework adaptable to evolving target domains: it adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher is domain-aware and generalized for evolving domains. To improve teacher predictions, we propose a refine-then-filter based on dropout-driven consistency, which calibrates predictions and removes unreliable guidance. For the adaptation-generalization trade-off, we construct a domain-aware teacher by dynamically accumulating cross-domain semantics via incremental PCA, which continuously tracks domain shifts. Experiments show CTTA-T excels baselines.

TL;DR: The paper investigates reasoning strategies for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in multi-hop QA tasks, proposing a novel framework LiR$^3$AG that reduces computational costs and enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiencies and performance challenges in reasoning models for RAG multi-hop QA tasks.

Method: Comprehensive study of reasoning strategies in RAG, identifying structured approaches, and creation of the LiR$^3$AG framework for reasoning transfer using coherent reasoning chains.

Result: LiR$^3$AG reduces output token overhead by 98%, inference time by 58.6%, and enhances F1 performance (6.2%-22.5%) in small non-reasoning models, often surpassing larger reasoning models.

Conclusion: LiR$^3$AG provides an efficient alternative to traditional reasoning models in RAG systems, offering better performance with lower computational demands.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. Reasoning models improve LLM performance in multi-hop QA tasks, which require integrating and reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence across different documents to answer a complex question. However, they often introduce substantial computational costs, including increased token consumption and inference latency. To better understand and mitigate this trade-off, we conduct a comprehensive study of reasoning strategies for reasoning models in RAG multi-hop QA tasks. Our findings reveal that reasoning models adopt structured strategies to integrate retrieved and internal knowledge, primarily following two modes: Context-Grounded Reasoning, which relies directly on retrieved content, and Knowledge-Reconciled Reasoning, which resolves conflicts or gaps using internal knowledge. To this end, we propose a novel Lightweight Rerank Reasoning Strategy Framework for RAG (LiR$^3$AG) to enable non-reasoning models to transfer reasoning strategies by restructuring retrieved evidence into coherent reasoning chains. LiR$^3$AG significantly reduce the average 98% output tokens overhead and 58.6% inferencing time while improving 8B non-reasoning model's F1 performance ranging from 6.2% to 22.5% to surpass the performance of 32B reasoning model in RAG, offering a practical and efficient path forward for RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentInfer, a framework to make large language model-based agents more efficient in reasoning and decision-making tasks by reducing latency using a combination of innovative techniques like dynamic model usage, speculative decoding, and memory compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model agents face inefficiencies in real-world deployment due to delays caused by reasoning loops, increasing context size, and complex tool interactions. The paper aims to address such systemic latency issues to improve their practicality and scalability.

Method: The framework, AgentInfer, utilizes four core components: (1) AgentCollab for hierarchical reasoning with mixed large-small models; (2) AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler to optimize latency; (3) AgentSAM, which accelerates inference via speculative decoding using semantic memory; and (4) AgentCompress, which manages memory compression asynchronously to support ongoing tasks.

Result: AgentInfer demonstrated a reduction in ineffective token consumption by over 50% and achieved a 1.8-2.5x overall speedup while maintaining accuracy during experiments on benchmarks like BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver.

Conclusion: Optimizing language model-based agents for task completion rather than token-level efficiency can significantly improve their performance. AgentInfer shows great potential in enabling efficient, scalable, and self-improving intelligent systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language model (LLM)-based agents has unlocked new possibilities for autonomous multi-turn reasoning and tool-augmented decision-making. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by severe inefficiencies that arise not from isolated model inference, but from the systemic latency accumulated across reasoning loops, context growth, and heterogeneous tool interactions. This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy. These results underscore that optimizing for agentic task completion-rather than merely per-token throughput-is the key to building scalable, efficient, and self-improving intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of early rumor detection in data-scarce environments and limitations of LLMs in time-series applications.

Method: Introduced a framework combining a lightweight autonomous agent for early decision-making and an LLM-based rumor detector without training the LLM.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets showed performance improvement in both accuracy and earliness over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively balances computational efficiency and detection accuracy, providing a notable solution for few-shot EARD scenarios.

Abstract: Early Rumor Detection (EARD) aims to identify the earliest point at which a claim can be accurately classified based on a sequence of social media posts. This is especially challenging in data-scarce settings. While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in few-shot NLP tasks, they are not well-suited for time-series data and are computationally expensive for both training and inference. In this work, we propose a novel EARD framework that combines an autonomous agent and an LLM-based detection model, where the agent acts as a reliable decision-maker for \textit{early time point determination}, while the LLM serves as a powerful \textit{rumor detector}. This approach offers the first solution for few-shot EARD, necessitating only the training of a lightweight agent and allowing the LLM to remain training-free. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our approach boosts performance across LLMs and surpasses existing EARD methods in accuracy and earliness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate issues like hallucination and reliance on supervised training in RDF-to-text generation.

Method: Using LLM agents to collaboratively generate Python code for text generation without human reference texts or in-domain datasets.

Result: The approach generates interpretable results with reduced hallucination and near-instantaneous outputs, tested on WebNLG and OpenDialKG datasets.

Conclusion: The method improves RDF-to-text generation efficiency and interpretability, with minimal fluency penalties compared to established methods.

Abstract: We present a novel neurosymbolic framework for RDF-to-text generation, in which the model is "trained" through collaborative interactions among multiple LLM agents rather than traditional backpropagation. The LLM agents produce rule-based Python code for a generator for the given domain, based on RDF triples only, with no in-domain human reference texts. The resulting system is fully interpretable, requires no supervised training data, and generates text nearly instantaneously using only a single CPU. Our experiments on the WebNLG and OpenDialKG data show that outputs produced by our approach reduce hallucination, with only slight fluency penalties compared to finetuned or prompted language models

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance language learning by providing personalized, engaging, and vocabulary-specific resources through technology.

Method: Utilizing large language models and incorporating lexical constraints in story generation for vocabulary learning. Experiments analyze three story generation methods and strategies.

Result: Generated stories are more grammatical, coherent, and offer superior word usage examples compared to traditional constrained beam search methods.

Conclusion: Optimized story generation aids vocabulary learning effectively, showcasing promise for language education applications in multiple languages such as English, Chinese, and Polish.

Abstract: In this paper, we use large language models to generate personalized stories for language learners, using only the vocabulary they know. The generated texts are specifically written to teach the user new vocabulary by simply reading stories where it appears in context, while at the same time seamlessly reviewing recently learned vocabulary. The generated stories are enjoyable to read and the vocabulary reviewing/learning is optimized by a Spaced Repetition System. The experiments are conducted in three languages: English, Chinese and Polish, evaluating three story generation methods and three strategies for enforcing lexical constraints. The results show that the generated stories are more grammatical, coherent, and provide better examples of word usage than texts generated by the standard constrained beam search approach

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AraToken, a tokenizer optimized for Arabic, addressing challenges in morphologically rich languages and improving compression efficiency and training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenizers designed for general-purpose languages underperform on morphologically rich languages like Arabic, leading to inefficient downstream NLP tasks.

Method: The approach integrates the SentencePiece Unigram algorithm with a normalization pipeline for Arabic orthographic-specific features and proposes the Language Extension Pipeline (LEP) for model adaption.

Result: AraToken achieves 18% lower fertility compared to unnormalized baselines and reduces evaluation loss significantly with LEP during training.

Conclusion: AraToken enhances tokenization efficiency for Arabic, enabling better training and performance for NLP tasks; authors provide resources for further research.

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step for large language models (LLMs), directly impacting training efficiency and downstream performance. General-purpose tokenizers trained predominantly on English and Latin-script languages exhibit suboptimal performance on morphologically rich languages such as Arabic, resulting in inflated token sequences and reduced compression efficiency. In this work, we present AraToken, an Arabic-optimized tokenizer built on SentencePiece Unigram algorithm with a comprehensive normalization pipeline addressing Arabic-specific orthographic variations including Alif variants, diacritics, and Arabic-Indic numerals. We systematically compare BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece algorithms across multiple configurations, demonstrating that SentencePiece with normalization achieves 18% lower fertility (1.199 vs 1.35 tokens/word) compared to unnormalized baselines. Furthermore, we introduce the Language Extension Pipeline (LEP), a method for integrating the optimized tokenizer into Qwen3-0.6B through vocabulary extension with mean subtoken initialization and selective transformer layer unfreezing. Our experiments show that LEP reduces evaluation loss from 8.28 to 2.43 within 800 training steps on 100K Arabic samples. We release our tokenizer, training scripts, and model checkpoints to facilitate Arabic NLP research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for enhancing virtual simulated patients in medical education by providing tools for scenario generation, controlled patient dialogue, and structured feedback, evaluated successfully in an interactive medical consultation setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual simulated patients face challenges like medical inaccuracy, inconsistent role-playing, lack of effective scenario generation, and absence of structured educational feedback.

Method: The paper presents an agentic framework combining evidence-based vignette generation, controlled persona-driven dialogue with optional retrieval grounding, and standards-based assessment. It was implemented in an interactive spoken consultation system and tested with medical students.

Result: Medical students found the framework's tools realistic, well-calibrated in difficulty, stable in personality representation, and useful for structured feedback. Usability scores were excellent.

Conclusion: Agentic separation of scenario control, interaction control, and standards-based assessment appears effective for creating reliable and educationally useful virtual simulated patient training solutions.

Abstract: Advancements in large language models offer strong potential for enhancing virtual simulated patients (VSPs) in medical education by providing scalable alternatives to resource-intensive traditional methods. However, current VSPs often struggle with medical accuracy, consistent roleplaying, scenario generation for VSP use, and educationally structured feedback. We introduce an agentic framework for training general practitioner student skills that unifies (i) configurable, evidence-based vignette generation, (ii) controlled persona-driven patient dialogue with optional retrieval grounding, and (iii) standards-based assessment and feedback for both communication and clinical reasoning. We instantiate the framework in an interactive spoken consultation setting and evaluate it with medical students ($\mathbf{N{=}14}$). Participants reported realistic and vignette-faithful dialogue, appropriate difficulty calibration, a stable personality signal, and highly useful example-rich feedback, alongside excellent overall usability. These results support agentic separation of scenario control, interaction control, and standards-based assessment as a practical pattern for building dependable and pedagogically valuable VSP training tools.

### [90] [Mitigating Spurious Correlations in NLI via LLM-Synthesized Counterfactuals and Dynamic Balanced Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18462)
*Christopher Román Jaimes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses spurious correlations in NLI models by proposing a scalable pipeline that enhances semantic reasoning without incurring high costs or catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the reliance of NLI models on spurious correlations and mitigate the drawbacks of existing fine-tuning methods, which are costly and prone to forgetting useful knowledge.

Method: The method involves introducing LF-LMI for artifact detection, generating synthetic contrast sets using an LLM pipeline with multi-judge verification, and employing Dynamic Balanced Sampling for training.

Result: The proposed method improves consistency on a benchmark from 63.5% to 81.0% while sustaining an in-domain accuracy of 88.4%, outperforming conventional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the approach effectively addresses the semantic reasoning weaknesses of NLI models and avoids the drawbacks of traditional methods.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) models frequently rely on spurious correlations rather than semantic reasoning. Existing mitigation strategies often incur high annotation costs or trigger catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. We propose an automated, scalable pipeline to address these limitations. First, we introduce Log-Frequency LMI (LF-LMI) to accurately detect semantic artifacts. Second, we generate a high-quality synthetic contrast set via an LLM-synthesis pipeline with multi-judge verification. Finally, we introduce Dynamic Balanced Sampling, a training strategy that rotates the original data distribution to prevent forgetting. Our method improves consistency on a challenging benchmark from 63.5% to 81.0% while maintaining 88.4% in-domain accuracy, significantly outperforming naive fine-tuning.

### [91] [Research on a hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention model for text-based web content classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18475)
*Mykola Kuz,Ihor Lazarovych,Mykola Kozlenko,Mykola Pikuliak,Andrii Kvasniuk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning model combining LSTM, CNN, and Attention mechanism excels in web content classification, achieving 0.98 accuracy and surpassing baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance text-based web content classification by addressing limitations in existing approaches using a hybrid architecture.

Method: A hybrid architecture integrates LSTM, CNN, and Attention mechanism, leveraging GloVe embeddings for semantic representation. A 5-fold cross-validation setup was used for evaluation.

Result: The hybrid model achieved 0.98 accuracy, 0.94 precision, 0.92 recall, and 0.93 F1-score, outperforming other CNN, LSTM, and transformer-based models like BERT.

Conclusion: The proposed method is highly effective for web content classification, combining fine-grained and semantic analysis. It is suitable for real-time applications and demonstrates the value of hybrid approaches in NLP tasks.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates LSTM, CNN, and an Attention mechanism to enhance the classification of web content based on text. Pretrained GloVe embeddings are used to represent words as dense vectors that preserve semantic similarity. The CNN layer extracts local n-gram patterns and lexical features, while the LSTM layer models long-range dependencies and sequential structure. The integrated Attention mechanism enables the model to focus selectively on the most informative parts of the input sequence. A 5-fold cross-validation setup was used to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed solution. Experimental results show that the hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention model achieved outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.92, and F1-score of 0.93. These results surpass the performance of baseline models based solely on CNNs, LSTMs, or transformer-based classifiers such as BERT. The combination of neural network components enabled the model to effectively capture both fine-grained text structures and broader semantic context. Furthermore, the use of GloVe embeddings provided an efficient and effective representation of textual data, making the model suitable for integration into systems with real-time or near-real-time requirements. The proposed hybrid architecture demonstrates high effectiveness in text-based web content classification, particularly in tasks requiring both syntactic feature extraction and semantic interpretation. By combining presented mechanisms, the model addresses the limitations of individual architectures and achieves improved generalization. These findings support the broader use of hybrid deep learning approaches in NLP applications, especially where complex, unstructured textual data must be processed and classified with high reliability.

*Vagrant Gautam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the loosely defined terms in NLP like 'interpretability,' 'bias,' and proposes a seminar to critically explore and operationalize such concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clear definition and operationalization for key concepts like 'bias' and 'reasoning' within NLP research, and to improve the methodologies and claims made in the field.

Method: An educational seminar with an interdisciplinary reading list and discussions was created to critically explore and operationalize these abstract NLP terms.

Result: The paper describes the seminar design, emphasizing student critique and interdisciplinary learning to clarify NLP concepts.

Conclusion: More rigorous exploration of conceptual definitions and measurement approaches is necessary for advancing NLP research.

Abstract: NLP researchers regularly invoke abstract concepts like "interpretability," "bias," "reasoning," and "stereotypes," without defining them. Each subfield has a shared understanding or conceptualization of what these terms mean and how we should treat them, and this shared understanding is the basis on which operational decisions are made: Datasets are built to evaluate these concepts, metrics are proposed to quantify them, and claims are made about systems. But what do they mean, what should they mean, and how should we measure them? I outline a seminar I created for students to explore these questions of conceptualization and operationalization, with an interdisciplinary reading list and an emphasis on discussion and critique.

*S Mahmudul Hasan,Shaily Roy,Akib Jawad Nafis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the limitations of linguistic-only automated political fact-checking, revealing a performance ceiling and suggesting that model capacity or data augmentation alone does not resolve it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to investigate the bottleneck affecting current automated fact-checking systems in detecting subtle political disinformation using only linguistic features.

Method: The study conducted a systematic evaluation of nine machine learning models on the LIAR benchmark using lexical (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF) and semantic features (GloVe), along with empirical testing of generalization gaps and data augmentation techniques.

Result: The paper reveals a performance ceiling in fine-grained classification (F1 = 0.32), equivalence in accuracy between linear SVM and complex models like RoBERTa, generalization issues in tree-based ensembles, and no gains from synthetic data augmentation via SMOTE.

Conclusion: Political fact-checking systems need to move beyond linguistic modeling and incorporate external knowledge, as increasing model complexity alone does not solve the semantic limitations inherent to the task.

Abstract: The proliferation of linguistically subtle political disinformation poses a significant challenge to automated fact-checking systems. Despite increasing emphasis on complex neural architectures, the empirical limits of text-only linguistic modeling remain underexplored. We present a systematic diagnostic evaluation of nine machine learning algorithms on the LIAR benchmark. By isolating lexical features (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF) and semantic embeddings (GloVe), we uncover a hard "Performance Ceiling", with fine-grained classification not exceeding a Weighted F1-score of 0.32 across models. Crucially, a simple linear SVM (Accuracy: 0.624) matches the performance of pre-trained Transformers such as RoBERTa (Accuracy: 0.620), suggesting that model capacity is not the primary bottleneck. We further diagnose a massive "Generalization Gap" in tree-based ensembles, which achieve more than 99% training accuracy but collapse to approximately 25% on test data, indicating reliance on lexical memorization rather than semantic inference. Synthetic data augmentation via SMOTE yields no meaningful gains, confirming that the limitation is semantic (feature ambiguity) rather than distributional. These findings indicate that for political fact-checking, increasing model complexity without incorporating external knowledge yields diminishing returns.

### [94] [LLMs on Drugs: Language Models Are Few-Shot Consumers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18546)
*Alexander Doudkin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the effects of various persona prompts framing GPT-5-mini's inference behavior, identifying that prompts mimicking psychoactive substances disrupt model accuracy, especially the response template.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how different persona texts or prompt framings impact the performance and reliability of large language models, as such effects have not been systematically studied before.

Method: The authors conducted controlled benchmarking tests using four single-sentence prompts (LSD, cocaine, alcohol, and cannabis) on GPT-5-mini's ARC-Challenge task, employing deterministic decoding, confidence intervals, and statistical tests for evaluation.

Result: Accuracy significantly decreased under persona prompts compared to the sober control (0.45), with alcohol (0.10), cocaine (0.21), LSD (0.19), and cannabis (0.30), showing persona-driven disruption of response templates.

Conclusion: Persona text framing acts as a disruptive, task-specific input affecting the LLM’s reliability, emphasizing the need for caution in prompt design for sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are sensitive to the personas imposed on them at inference time, yet prompt-level "drug" interventions have never been benchmarked rigorously. We present the first controlled study of psychoactive framings on GPT-5-mini using ARC-Challenge. Four single-sentence prompts -- LSD, cocaine, alcohol, and cannabis -- are compared against a sober control across 100 validation items per condition, with deterministic decoding, full logging, Wilson confidence intervals, and Fisher exact tests. Control accuracy is 0.45; alcohol collapses to 0.10 (p = 3.2e-8), cocaine to 0.21 (p = 4.9e-4), LSD to 0.19 (p = 1.3e-4), and cannabis to 0.30 (p = 0.041), largely because persona prompts disrupt the mandated "Answer: <LETTER>" template. Persona text therefore behaves like a "few-shot consumable" that can destroy reliability without touching model weights. All experimental code, raw results, and analysis scripts are available at https://github.com/lexdoudkin/llms-on-drugs.

*Yuchen Li,Handing Wang,Bing Xue,Mengjie Zhang,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces APF, a framework using fine-tuned large language models to convert engineering requirements into optimization problem formulations without relying on expensive solver feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating ambiguous design requirements into optimization formulations is time-consuming, costly, and reliant on expert knowledge, creating a challenge in simulation-driven design domains.

Method: APF uses a pipeline to generate high-quality datasets for fine-tuning LLMs, avoiding solver feedback and enabling accurate conversion of natural language requirements into executable models.

Result: Experiments on antenna design show that APF improves requirement formalization accuracy and generates optimization models that better meet design goals.

Conclusion: The APF framework demonstrates significant potential for automating design optimization tasks, reducing dependency on experts and simulation feedback.

Abstract: In the high-cost simulation-driven design domain, translating ambiguous design requirements into a mathematical optimization formulation is a bottleneck for optimizing product performance. This process is time-consuming and heavily reliant on expert knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating this task, existing approaches either suffer from poor formalization that fails to accurately align with the design intent or rely on solver feedback for data filtering, which is unavailable due to the high simulation costs. To address this challenge, we propose APF, a framework for solver-independent, automated problem formulation via LLMs designed to automatically convert engineers' natural language requirements into executable optimization models. The core of this framework is an innovative pipeline for automatically generating high-quality data, which overcomes the difficulty of constructing suitable fine-tuning datasets in the absence of high-cost solver feedback with the help of data generation and test instance annotation. The generated high-quality dataset is used to perform supervised fine-tuning on LLMs, significantly enhancing their ability to generate accurate and executable optimization problem formulations. Experimental results on antenna design demonstrate that APF significantly outperforms the existing methods in both the accuracy of requirement formalization and the quality of resulting radiation efficiency curves in meeting the design goals.

### [96] [Neologism Learning as a Parameter-Efficient Alternative to Fine-Tuning for Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18551)
*Sungjoon Park,Varun Ramamurthi,Owen Terry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores 'neologisms,' new tokens trained for specific model behavior, comparing their efficiency to fine-tuning methods like LoRA. Neologisms perform better and preserve model flexibility in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current behavioral steering of language models requires resource-intensive fine-tuning, limiting flexibility and access to default behaviors. The study introduces 'neologisms' as an alternative.

Method: The paper evaluates neologism learning against LoRA fine-tuning using matched setups in data and hyperparameters. Additionally, it examines how models self-verbalize neologisms by generating their own innovations.

Result: Neologisms outperform LoRA fine-tuning under identical conditions and allow users to still access the model's default behaviors. Models can also generate their own creative responses about neologisms.

Conclusion: Neologisms are not only effective for training new behaviors but also preserve default functionalities and require fewer resources compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: In language modeling, neologisms are new tokens trained to represent a concept not already included in a given model's vocabulary. Neologisms can be used to encourage specific behavior in models, for example by appending prompts with "Give me a neologism answer." Behavioral steering can also be achieved through fine-tuning, albeit with more compute and less flexibility: learning a neologism only trains d parameters and allows the user to still access the model's default behavior. We compare the performance of neologism learning against low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, finding that neologisms outperform fine-tuned models under a matched training setup (same data and hyperparameters). We also investigate self-verbalizations of neologisms, and observe that the model will occasionally make up its own new words when asked about a neologism.

### [97] [FASTRIC: Prompt Specification Language for Verifiable LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18940)
*Wen-Long Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FASTRIC, a Prompt Specification Language using Finite State Machines (FSMs) in natural language prompts to verify LLM execution against designer intent. Testing reveals the need to optimize specification formality based on LLM capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of formal specifications for verifying large language models' multi-turn interaction against designer intent.

Method: FASTRIC encodes Finite State Machines in natural language prompts, enabling verification through execution trace analysis based on seven FSM elements. Models were tested using a kindergarten tutoring FSM across multiple specification formality levels and model scales.

Result: Testing revealed specific 'Goldilocks zones' of formality for different LLM scales, with optimal adaptations varying between model capacity. DeepSeek-V3.2 showed perfect conformance at certain levels, while ChatGPT-5 and Phi4 demonstrated varied adherence and collapse at over-constrained specifications.

Conclusion: Prompt Specification Engineering with formal FSM structures enhances verifiable LLM interaction design, transforming it into systematic engineering with measurable guarantees, though balancing formality is key depending on model capacity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) execute complex multi-turn interaction protocols but lack formal specifications to verify execution against designer intent. We introduce FASTRIC, a Prompt Specification Language that makes implicit Finite State Machines (FSMs) explicit in natural language prompts, enabling conformance verification through execution trace analysis. The LLM serves as intelligent execution agent: interpreting designer-encoded FSMs to execute specified behavioral roles. Unlike symbolic specification languages requiring parsers and compilers, FASTRIC leverages LLMs as unified infrastructure-simultaneously parser, interpreter, runtime environment, and development assistant. FASTRIC guides designers to articulate seven FSM elements (Final States, Agents, States, Triggers, Roles, Initial State, Constraints) structuring multi-turn interactions. Specification formality-ranging from implicit descriptions that frontier models infer to explicit step-by-step instructions for weaker models-serves as a design parameter. We introduce procedural conformance as verification metric measuring execution adherence to FSM specifications. Testing a 3-state kindergarten tutoring FSM across four formality levels and three model scales (14.7B, 685B, 1T+ parameters) reveals optimal specification formality is a function of model capacity. DeepSeek-V3.2 (685B) achieves perfect conformance (1.00) at L2-L4; ChatGPT-5 (~1T) peaks at L3 (0.90) before collapsing at L4 (0.39); Phi4 (14.7B) shows no stable optimum with high variance (SD=0.16-0.36). These findings reveal model-specific formality ranges-"Goldilocks zones"-where specifications provide sufficient structure without over-constraint, establishing Prompt Specification Engineering for creating verifiable interaction protocols, transforming multi-turn interaction design from heuristic art to systematic engineering with measurable procedural guarantees.

*Amit Barman,Atanu Mandal,Sudip Kumar Naskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses language barriers in legal documentation in multilingual nations using legal machine translation (L-MT), focusing on English-Hindi. A fine-tuned OPUS-MT model performed best for translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal information is inaccessible in multilingual nations like India due to documentation mostly in English. This creates a need for scalable solutions like Legal Machine Translation (L-MT).

Method: Two strategies were tested: fine-tuning a pre-trained OPUS-MT model for domain-specific adaptation and training a Transformer model from scratch with legal corpus data. Performance was evaluated using various MT metrics.

Result: The fine-tuned OPUS-MT model achieved a SacreBLEU score of 46.03, outperforming baseline and from-scratch models, showing the effectiveness of domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation of pre-trained L-MT models significantly improves legal translation quality, enabling access to legal information and enhancing transparency in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: In multilingual nations like India, access to legal information is often hindered by language barriers, as much of the legal and judicial documentation remains in English. Legal Machine Translation (L-MT) offers a scalable solution to this challenge by enabling accurate and accessible translations of legal documents. This paper presents our work for the JUST-NLP 2025 Legal MT shared task, focusing on English-Hindi translation using Transformer-based approaches. We experiment with 2 complementary strategies, fine-tuning a pre-trained OPUS-MT model for domain-specific adaptation and training a Transformer model from scratch using the provided legal corpus. Performance is evaluated using standard MT metrics, including SacreBLEU, chrF++, TER, ROUGE, BERTScore, METEOR, and COMET. Our fine-tuned OPUS-MT model achieves a SacreBLEU score of 46.03, significantly outperforming both baseline and from-scratch models. The results highlight the effectiveness of domain adaptation in enhancing translation quality and demonstrate the potential of L-MT systems to improve access to justice and legal transparency in multilingual contexts.

*Charles J. Lovering,Seth Ebner,Brandon Smock,Michael Krumdick,Saad Rabbani,Ahmed Muhammad,Varshini Reddy,Chris Tanner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models (LMs) are evaluated for their ability to detect inconsistencies in documents using the FIND benchmark. The best model, GPT-5, finds many inconsistencies but still struggles with detecting about half.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In academia, law, and finance, inconsistencies in documents can have severe consequences, necessitating robust auditing. The paper investigates whether language models can significantly aid this process.

Method: The authors introduced the FIND benchmark, involving complex documents manually embedded with inconsistencies by experts. Various LMs, including GPT-5, were tested for their inconsistency detection capabilities.

Result: GPT-5 performed best by detecting 64% of the inserted inconsistencies and revealed additional unnoticed inconsistencies within documents, such as arXiv papers, where 136 out of 196 suggestions were legitimate. However, many inconsistencies remained undetected.

Conclusion: While language models, especially GPT-5, show impressive potential in aiding document auditing, they are not yet reliable standalone tools for inconsistency detection due to their significant omission rate.

Abstract: Professionals in academia, law, and finance audit their documents because inconsistencies can result in monetary, reputational, and scientific costs. Language models (LMs) have the potential to dramatically speed up this auditing process. To understand their abilities, we introduce a benchmark, FIND (Finding INconsistencies in Documents), where each example is a document with an inconsistency inserted manually by a domain expert. Despite the documents being long, technical, and complex, the best-performing model (gpt-5) recovered 64% of the inserted inconsistencies. Surprisingly, gpt-5 also found undiscovered inconsistencies present in the original documents. For example, on 50 arXiv papers, we judged 136 out of 196 of the model's suggestions to be legitimate inconsistencies missed by the original authors. However, despite these findings, even the best models miss almost half of the inconsistencies in FIND, demonstrating that inconsistency detection is still a challenging task.

*Prabigya Acharya,Liza Shrestha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the effectiveness of lightweight models for masking Personally Identifiable Information (PII), comparing encoder-decoder (T5-small) and decoder-only (Mistral-Instruct-v0.3) architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if lightweight models can reliably mask PII in privacy-preserving systems, addressing privacy and computational concerns linked with large language models (LLMs).

Method: Fine-tuning T5-small and Mistral-Instruct-v0.3 on AI4Privacy datasets, with variations for label standardization and PII representation, evaluated using multiple detailed metrics for PII-masking performance.

Result: Both lightweight models achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs. Label normalization improves results, and Mistral outperforms in robustness but with higher latency, while T5 excels in structured outputs and real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: Lightweight models can effectively mask PII and may serve as alternatives to LLMs, offering trade-offs in performance, efficiency, and robustness, suitable for real-world applications like a Discord bot.

Abstract: Automated masking of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for privacy-preserving conversational systems. While current frontier large language models demonstrate strong PII masking capabilities, concerns about data handling and computational costs motivate exploration of whether lightweight models can achieve comparable performance. We compare encoder-decoder and decoder-only architectures by fine-tuning T5-small and Mistral-Instruct-v0.3 on English datasets constructed from the AI4Privacy benchmark. We create different dataset variants to study label standardization and PII representation, covering 24 standardized PII categories and higher-granularity settings. Evaluation using entity-level and character-level metrics, type accuracy, and exact match shows that both lightweight models achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs for PII masking tasks. Label normalization consistently improves performance across architectures. Mistral achieves higher F1 and recall with greater robustness across PII types but incurs significantly higher generation latency. T5, while less robust in conversational text, offers more controllable structured outputs and lower inference cost, motivating its use in a real-time Discord bot for real-world PII redaction. Evaluation on live messages reveals performance degradation under informal inputs. These results clarify trade-offs between accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, demonstrating that lightweight models can provide effective PII masking while addressing data handling concerns associated with frontier LLMs.

*Jensen Zhang,Ningyuan Liu,Yijia Fan,Zihao Huang,Qinglin Zeng,Kaitong Cai,Jian Wang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-CAS, a dynamic framework for addressing hallucinated content in large language models (LLMs) without permanent parameter modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitation of LLMs generating hallucinated content that lacks grounding, an issue especially problematic in critical applications.

Method: LLM-CAS formulates hallucination correction as a hierarchical reinforcement learning task, where an agent dynamically adjusts neuron perturbations during inference without altering permanent parameters.

Result: Experiments showcase increased accuracy in LLM outputs, with performance improvements on benchmarks like StoryCloze (+10.98%), TriviaQA (+2.71%), and TruthfulQA MC1 score (+2.06%).

Conclusion: LLM-CAS demonstrates efficient, fine-grained, and adaptive mechanisms for improving LLM reliability, with potential for future multimodal expansion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinated content that lacks factual or contextual grounding, limiting their reliability in critical applications. Existing approaches such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback are data intensive and computationally expensive, while static parameter editing methods struggle with context dependent errors and catastrophic forgetting.
  We propose LLM-CAS, a framework that formulates real-time hallucination correction as a hierarchical reinforcement learning problem. LLM-CAS trains an agent to learn a policy that dynamically selects temporary neuron perturbations during inference based on the current context. Unlike prior dynamic approaches that rely on heuristic or predefined adjustments, this policy driven mechanism enables adaptive and fine grained correction without permanent parameter modification.
  Experiments across multiple language models demonstrate that LLM-CAS consistently improves factual accuracy, achieving gains of 10.98 percentage points on StoryCloze, 2.71 points on TriviaQA, and 2.06 points on the MC1 score of TruthfulQA. These results outperform both static editing methods such as ITI and CAA and the dynamic SADI framework. Overall, LLM-CAS provides an efficient and context aware solution for improving the reliability of LLMs, with promising potential for future multimodal extensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of automating a specialized legal workflow, capitalization tie-out, using AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the complex legal process of verifying capitalization tables in venture capital financing and overcome limitations in current AI systems.

Method: Introduce a world model architecture and compare the performance of existing agentic AI systems on legal workflows.

Result: Existing AI systems fall short of reliably performing capitalization tie-out tasks due to strict requirements like evidence traceability.

Conclusion: A dedicated framework and advancements are necessary to achieve reliable automation in specialized legal AI tasks like capitalization tie-out.

Abstract: Before closing venture capital financing rounds, lawyers conduct diligence that includes tying out the capitalization table: verifying that every security (for example, shares, options, warrants) and issuance term (for example, vesting schedules, acceleration triggers, transfer restrictions) is supported by large sets of underlying legal documentation. While LLMs continue to improve on legal benchmarks, specialized legal workflows, such as capitalization tie-out, remain out of reach even for strong agentic systems. The task requires multi-document reasoning, strict evidence traceability, and deterministic outputs that current approaches fail to reliably deliver. We characterize capitalization tie-out as an instance of a real-world benchmark for legal AI, analyze and compare the performance of existing agentic systems, and propose a world model architecture toward tie-out automation-and more broadly as a foundation for applied legal intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemEvolve proposes a new framework to evolve both experiential knowledge and memory architecture for LLM-based agents, addressing the staticity in memory systems. It achieves significant performance improvements on benchmarks and ensures standardization with its EvolveLab codebase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of static memory systems in LLM-based agents, which hinder meta-adaptation to diverse task contexts, and enable dynamic evolution of memory processing.

Method: The paper introduces MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework that evolves agents' experiential knowledge and memory architecture. It also provides EvolveLab, a modular codebase unifying twelve memory systems for standardization and experimentation.

Result: MemEvolve demonstrates significant performance improvements—up to 17.06%—on four agent benchmarks. It also shows strong generalization across tasks and LLM models, enhancing memory architecture transferability.

Conclusion: MemEvolve addresses the static nature of traditional memory systems, enabling LLM-based agents to better learn and adapt. The framework improves agent performance and sets a benchmark with its open-source EvolveLab platform.

Abstract: Self-evolving memory systems are unprecedentedly reshaping the evolutionary paradigm of large language model (LLM)-based agents. Prior work has predominantly relied on manually engineered memory architectures to store trajectories, distill experience, and synthesize reusable tools, enabling agents to evolve on the fly within environment interactions. However, this paradigm is fundamentally constrained by the staticity of the memory system itself: while memory facilitates agent-level evolving, the underlying memory architecture cannot be meta-adapted to diverse task contexts. To address this gap, we propose MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework that jointly evolves agents' experiential knowledge and their memory architecture, allowing agent systems not only to accumulate experience but also to progressively refine how they learn from it. To ground MemEvolve in prior research and foster openness in future self-evolving systems, we introduce EvolveLab, a unified self-evolving memory codebase that distills twelve representative memory systems into a modular design space (encode, store, retrieve, manage), providing both a standardized implementation substrate and a fair experimental arena. Extensive evaluations on four challenging agentic benchmarks demonstrate that MemEvolve achieves (I) substantial performance gains, improving frameworks such as SmolAgent and Flash-Searcher by up to $17.06\%$; and (II) strong cross-task and cross-LLM generalization, designing memory architectures that transfer effectively across diverse benchmarks and backbone models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper formalizes the problem of semantic channel finding in large-scale experimental infrastructures and proposes a four-paradigm framework to improve signal retrieval efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by operators and AI systems in locating control-system signals amidst inconsistent naming conventions, fragmented documentation, and expert-dependent processes, which hinder scalability and reliability in large experimental infrastructures.

Method: The authors propose a four-paradigm framework: (i) direct lookup in curated dictionaries, (ii) hierarchical navigation through structured trees, (iii) interactive agent exploration via iterative reasoning, and (iv) ontology-based semantic search decoupled from naming conventions, with proof-of-concept implementations across diverse facilities.

Result: The proposed paradigms are implemented in four different facilities, covering varying scales and architectures, achieving 90-97% accuracy on operational queries curated by experts.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust approach for mapping natural-language intent to control-system signals, enhancing the scalability, reliability, and language-based interactions in experimental infrastructures.

Abstract: Modern experimental platforms such as particle accelerators, fusion devices, telescopes, and industrial process control systems expose tens to hundreds of thousands of control and diagnostic channels accumulated over decades of evolution. Operators and AI systems rely on informal expert knowledge, inconsistent naming conventions, and fragmented documentation to locate signals for monitoring, troubleshooting, and automated control, creating a persistent bottleneck for reliability, scalability, and language-model-driven interfaces. We formalize semantic channel finding-mapping natural-language intent to concrete control-system signals-as a general problem in complex experimental infrastructure, and introduce a four-paradigm framework to guide architecture selection across facility-specific data regimes. The paradigms span (i) direct in-context lookup over curated channel dictionaries, (ii) constrained hierarchical navigation through structured trees, (iii) interactive agent exploration using iterative reasoning and tool-based database queries, and (iv) ontology-grounded semantic search that decouples channel meaning from facility-specific naming conventions. We demonstrate each paradigm through proof-of-concept implementations at four operational facilities spanning two orders of magnitude in scale-from compact free-electron lasers to large synchrotron light sources-and diverse control-system architectures, from clean hierarchies to legacy environments. These implementations achieve 90-97% accuracy on expert-curated operational queries.

### [105] [From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18832)
*Yixia Li,Hongru Wang,Jiahao Qiu,Zhenfei Yin,Dongdong Zhang,Cheng Qian,Zeping Li,Pony Ma,Guanhua Chen,Heng Ji,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the feasibility and conditions under which large language models (LLMs) can serve as world models to improve reinforcement learning performance in text-based environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in agentic reinforcement learning, which relies heavily on real-world experiences that are often non-adaptive, limited in scale, and lack comprehensive coverage. The paper explores whether LLMs could serve as efficient simulated environments for better learning.

Method: The authors introduce a three-level framework to evaluate LLM-based world models: measuring fidelity and consistency, scalability and robustness, and agent utility. Text-based environments are used as a controlled setting to reinterpret language modeling as next-state prediction.

Result: The study finds that LLM world models, when sufficiently trained, maintain consistent latent states, show predictable scalability with data/model size, and can enhance agent performance through action verification, synthetic trajectory generation, and reinforcement learning warm-starts. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the behavioral coverage and complexity of the environment.

Conclusion: LLM-based world models hold potential to enhance agent learning in controlled settings but have limitations tied to environmental complexity and behavioral coverage. These constraints demarcate when such world models are truly beneficial.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning increasingly relies on experience-driven scaling, yet real-world environments remain non-adaptive, limited in coverage, and difficult to scale. World models offer a potential way to improve learning efficiency through simulated experience, but it remains unclear whether large language models can reliably serve this role and under what conditions they meaningfully benefit agents. We study these questions in text-based environments, which provide a controlled setting to reinterpret language modeling as next-state prediction under interaction. We introduce a three-level framework for evaluating LLM-based world models: (i) fidelity and consistency, (ii) scalability and robustness, and (iii) agent utility. Across five representative environments, we find that sufficiently trained world models maintain coherent latent state, scale predictably with data and model size, and improve agent performance via action verification, synthetic trajectory generation, and warm-starting reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, these gains depend critically on behavioral coverage and environment complexity, delineating clear boundry on when world modeling effectively supports agent learning.

### [106] [AraMix: Recycling, Refiltering, and Deduplicating to Deliver the Largest Arabic Pretraining Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18834)
*Sultan Alrashed,Francesco Orabona*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AraMix is a deduplicated pretraining corpus of Arabic text featuring 178 billion tokens, created by curating and refining existing datasets instead of new web scraping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large, high-quality Arabic datasets for language pretraining, and further web scraping often reproduces redundancy.

Method: AraMix combines seven public datasets, applies Arabic-specific quality filters, and employs MinHash and sentence-level deduplication.

Result: Nearly 60% of tokens in the datasets are duplicates, highlighting the importance of deduplication; AraMix is now the largest heavily filtered Arabic pretraining corpus.

Conclusion: Investing in curation pipelines for existing datasets can yield more valuable corpora for low-resource languages than new web scraping efforts.

Abstract: We present AraMix, a deduplicated Arabic pretraining corpus containing approximately 178 billion tokens across 179 million documents. Rather than scraping the web again, AraMix demonstrates that substantial value lies in systematically reusing and curating existing pretraining datasets: we combine seven publicly available Arabic web datasets, apply quality filtering designed specifically for Arabic text to re-filter some datasets, and perform cross-dataset deduplication, both MinHash and sentence-level. This approach reveals that nearly 60% of tokens across these independently collected corpora are duplicates, redundancy that any new scraping efforts will reproduce. Our work suggests that for lower resource languages, investment in curation pipelines for existing data yields greater returns than additional web crawls, an approach that allowed us to curate the largest heavily filtered publicly available Arabic pretraining corpus.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MDToC method to improve calculation verification and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, outperforming other techniques on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with calculation verification despite their advances in mathematical reasoning, highlighting the need for more effective methods.

Method: The authors propose MDToC, a three-phase approach involving a concept tree, accuracy-verified calculations, and majority voting to improve solution evaluation.

Result: MDToC enhances LLM performance, with notable results of 58.1% on CHAMP, 86.6% on MATH, and 85% on Game-of-24 benchmarks, surpassing other methods by 4%-7.6%.

Conclusion: MDToC establishes itself as a reliable approach for advancing mathematical reasoning and calculation verification in LLMs, showing marked improvements over existing techniques.

Abstract: Despite advances in mathematical reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with calculation verification when using established prompting techniques. We present MDToC (Metacognitive Dynamic Tree of Concepts), a three-phase approach that constructs a concept tree, develops accuracy-verified calculations for each concept, and employs majority voting to evaluate competing solutions. Evaluations across CHAMP, MATH, and Game-of-24 benchmarks demonstrate our MDToC's effectiveness, with GPT-4-Turbo achieving 58.1\% on CHAMP, 86.6\% on MATH, and 85\% on Game-of-24 - outperforming GoT by 5\%, 5.4\%, and 4\% on all these tasks, respectively, without hand-engineered hints. MDToC consistently surpasses existing prompting methods across all backbone models, yielding improvements of up to 7.6\% over ToT and 6.2\% over GoT, establishing metacognitive calculation verification as a promising direction for enhanced mathematical reasoning.

### [108] [Toward Human-Centered AI-Assisted Terminology Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18859)
*Antonio San Martin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the impact of generative AI on terminology work, proposing a human-centered framework to balance automation and human control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by unstructured AI adoption on terminology work, including risks to linguistic diversity, bias, and professional autonomy.

Method: The paper develops a human-centered framework for AI in terminology, focusing on augmented roles, ethical practices, and design tailored to terminologists.

Result: It presents a framework emphasizing high automation with human control, the role of terminologists in bias mitigation, and AI workflows designed for terminologists' well-being.

Conclusion: The adoption of AI will significantly influence the future of terminological accuracy, diversity, and specialized knowledge preservation.

Abstract: The rapid diffusion of generative artificial intelligence is transforming terminology work. While this technology promises gains in efficiency, its unstructured adoption risks weakening professional autonomy, amplifying bias, and eroding linguistic and conceptual diversity. This paper argues that a human-centered approach to artificial intelligence has become a necessity for terminology work. Building on research in artificial intelligence and translation studies, it proposes a human-centered framework that conceptualizes artificial intelligence as a means of amplifying the terminologist's capabilities, rather than replacing them. The framework is organized around three interrelated dimensions: the augmented terminologist, ethical AI, and human-centered design. Together, these dimensions emphasize the compatibility of high automation with strong human control, the central role of terminologists in bias mitigation, and the importance of designing AI tools and workflows around the needs, values, and well-being of the terminologist. The paper concludes by stressing that current choices in AI adoption will shape not only terminological practice, but also the preservation of accuracy, adequacy, and diversity in terminology and specialized knowledge.

### [109] [Can LLMs Estimate Student Struggles? Human-AI Difficulty Alignment with Proficiency Simulation for Item Difficulty Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18880)
*Ming Li,Han Chen,Yunze Xiao,Jian Chen,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) align with human perception of task difficulty and identifies systemic misalignments due to limitations in introspection and adoption of human-like proficiency levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether LLMs, which are proficient problem solvers, can perceive and predict the cognitive struggles of human learners during educational assessments.

Method: A large-scale analysis was conducted, testing over 20 LLMs across various domains, including medical knowledge and mathematical reasoning, to evaluate their difficulty alignment with human learners.

Result: Findings show a misalignment where larger models achieve consensus amongst themselves but fail to align with human ratings of difficulty. Moreover, high-performing models struggle to simulate human-like limits and fail introspection.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack the capability to estimate human cognitive struggles accurately, stressing the need for further research to enhance their alignment with human difficulty assessments.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of item (question or task) difficulty is critical for educational assessment but suffers from the cold start problem. While Large Language Models demonstrate superhuman problem-solving capabilities, it remains an open question whether they can perceive the cognitive struggles of human learners. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Human-AI Difficulty Alignment for over 20 models across diverse domains such as medical knowledge and mathematical reasoning. Our findings reveal a systematic misalignment where scaling up model size is not reliably helpful; instead of aligning with humans, models converge toward a shared machine consensus. We observe that high performance often impedes accurate difficulty estimation, as models struggle to simulate the capability limitations of students even when being explicitly prompted to adopt specific proficiency levels. Furthermore, we identify a critical lack of introspection, as models fail to predict their own limitations. These results suggest that general problem-solving capability does not imply an understanding of human cognitive struggles, highlighting the challenge of using current models for automated difficulty prediction.

### [110] [Remedy-R: Generative Reasoning for Machine Translation Evaluation without Error Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18906)
*Shaomu Tan,Ryosuke Mitani,Ritvik Choudhary,Qiyu Wu,Toshiyuki Sekiya,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Remedy-R, a reasoning-driven generative metric for evaluating machine translation (MT), which focuses on interpretability and robustness, and Remedy-R Agent for improving translations based on the evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although existing MT evaluation metrics show strong agreement with human ratings, they lack interpretability, fail with out-of-distribution data, and do not provide insights into their decision-making process.

Method: The authors use reinforcement learning from pairwise translation preferences to train Remedy-R. Remedy-R produces step-by-step analyses of accuracy, fluency, and completeness, offering reasons for its scoring. It does not rely on error span annotations or training from closed large language models. They also designed Remedy-R Agent, which refines translations through an evaluate-revise process.

Result: Remedy-R exhibits strong results with 60K training pairs, achieving competitive performance compared to top metrics, including GPT-4-based evaluations. It generalizes to other languages and shows robustness to out-of-distribution stress tests. Remedy-R Agent further enhances translation quality across different systems.

Conclusion: Remedy-R and its Agent provide interpretable and reliable MT evaluation and improvement capabilities, showing practical utility and setting the stage for robust MT evaluation in diverse settings.

Abstract: Over the years, automatic MT metrics have hillclimbed benchmarks and presented strong and sometimes human-level agreement with human ratings. Yet they remain black-box, offering little insight into their decision-making and often failing under real-world out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We introduce Remedy-R, a reasoning-driven generative MT metric trained with reinforcement learning from pairwise translation preferences, without requiring error-span annotations or distillation from closed LLMs. Remedy-R produces step-by-step analyses of accuracy, fluency, and completeness, followed by a final score, enabling more interpretable assessments. With only 60K training pairs across two language pairs, Remedy-R remains competitive with top scalar metrics and GPT-4-based judges on WMT22-24 meta-evaluation, generalizes to other languages, and exhibits strong robustness on OOD stress tests. Moreover, Remedy-R models generate self-reflective feedback that can be reused for translation improvement. Building on this finding, we introduce Remedy-R Agent, a simple evaluate-revise pipeline that leverages Remedy-R's evaluation analysis to refine translations. This agent consistently improves translation quality across diverse models, including Qwen2.5, ALMA-R, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.0-Flash, suggesting that Remedy-R's reasoning captures translation-relevant information and is practically useful.

*Jinyan Liu,Zikang Chen,Qinchuan Wang,Tan Xie,Heming Zheng,Xudong Lv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates two chatbot systems for medical follow-ups: an LLM-based end-to-end system and a modular pipeline. The modular approach shows improvement in dialog stability and extraction accuracy, reducing dialogue turns and token consumption substantially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex medical follow-up tasks due to the challenges of dialog flow and accurate information extraction.

Method: Two chatbot systems were developed and compared: a control group using an end-to-end LLM-based approach, and an experimental group using a modular pipeline with task decomposition, semantic clustering, and flow management.

Result: The modular pipeline significantly reduced dialog instability, improved accuracy, cut dialogue turns by 46.73%, and reduced token consumption by 80% to 87.5%.

Conclusion: External control mechanisms, such as modular pipelines, are essential for deploying LLMs effectively in high-stakes scenarios like medical follow-ups.

Abstract: When applied directly in an end-to-end manner to medical follow-up tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from uncontrolled dialog flow and inaccurate information extraction due to the complexity of follow-up forms. To address this limitation, we designed and compared two follow-up chatbot systems: an end-to-end LLM-based system (control group) and a modular pipeline with structured process control (experimental group). Experimental results show that while the end-to-end approach frequently fails on lengthy and complex forms, our modular method-built on task decomposition, semantic clustering, and flow management-substantially improves dialog stability and extraction accuracy. Moreover, it reduces the number of dialogue turns by 46.73% and lowers token consumption by 80% to 87.5%. These findings highlight the necessity of integrating external control mechanisms when deploying LLMs in high-stakes medical follow-up scenarios.

### [112] [Context-Aware Initialization for Reducing Generative Path Length in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19004)
*Tongyuan Miao,Gary Huang,Kai Jun Han,Annie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) by introducing context-aware initialization to reduce the required denoising iterations during inference, resulting in a faster generative trajectory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in DLLM token decoding caused by their dependence on numerous denoising iterations, making inference impractical without improvements.

Method: The paper proposes a training-free method that injects prompt-conditioned priors from an auxiliary model via discrete token injection and embedding interpolation. Additionally, a confidence-based remasking mechanism is introduced.

Result: Preliminary experiments on GSM8K show that context-aware initialization reduces denoising iterations by ~35%, though naive warm-starting may affect final accuracy negatively.

Conclusion: While promising in reducing computation, the approach reveals challenges in maintaining accuracy, suggesting future work in calibrating and aligning representation mechanisms for dependable decoding.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) enable fully parallel token decoding but often remain impractical at inference time due to the many denoising iterations required to refine an information-free, fully masked initialization into coherent text. Most existing acceleration methods focus on traversing this generative trajectory more efficiently via improved solvers or sampling strategies. We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization.
  We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines. We use these findings to motivate a research agenda around calibration, revision mechanisms, and representation alignment for reliable warm-started diffusion decoding.

### [113] [DramaBench: A Six-Dimensional Evaluation Framework for Drama Script Continuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19012)
*Shijian Ma,Yunqi Huang,Yan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DramaBench introduces a large-scale benchmark for evaluating drama script continuation across six key quality dimensions, relying on both automated and human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating drama script continuation fail to comprehensively test vital aspects like plot coherence, character consistency, and dramatic structure; thus, a more robust standard is needed.

Method: DramaBench evaluates scripts using six dimensions—Format Standards, Narrative Efficiency, Character Consistency, Emotional Depth, Logic Consistency, and Conflict Handling—through LLM-based labeling, rule-based analysis, and statistical metrics.

Result: The study evaluates eight state-of-the-art models on 1,103 scripts, conducting 8,824 evaluations while showing significant results in 65.9% of pairwise comparisons and ensuring high human validation agreement on 3/5 dimensions.

Conclusion: DramaBench is a rigorous framework for evaluating and improving creative writing models, offering actionable feedback with independently validated dimensions to set a new standard in drama script assessment.

Abstract: Drama script continuation requires models to maintain character consistency, advance plot coherently, and preserve dramatic structurecapabilities that existing benchmarks fail to evaluate comprehensively. We present DramaBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating drama script continuation across six independent dimensions: Format Standards, Narrative Efficiency, Character Consistency, Emotional Depth, Logic Consistency, and Conflict Handling. Our framework combines rulebased analysis with LLM-based labeling and statistical metrics, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art language models on 1,103 scripts (8,824 evaluations total), with rigorous statistical significance testing (252 pairwise comparisons, 65.9% significant) and human validation (188 scripts, substantial agreement on 3/5 dimensions). Our ablation studies confirm all six dimensions capture independent quality aspects (mean | r | = 0.020). DramaBench provides actionable, dimensionspecific feedback for model improvement and establishes a rigorous standard for creative writing evaluation.

### [114] [A Large Language Model Based Method for Complex Logical Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19092)
*Ziyan Zhang,Chao Wang,Zhuo Chen,Lei Chen,Chiyi Li,Kai Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROG, a framework utilizing large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) to address issues of incompleteness and complex logical queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning over KGs, addressing the challenges of inherent incompleteness and the complexity of first-order logic query structures that current methods struggle to handle effectively.

Method: The method involves an ensemble-style framework (ROG) that retrieves relevant subgraphs based on queries and uses a large language model with chain-of-thought reasoning to infer answers step-by-step, eliminating the need for embedding optimizations.

Result: ROG demonstrates consistent outperformance of embedding-based approaches, particularly on complex queries, as evaluated on standard KG reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ROG's integration of KG retrieval and LLM logical inference proves to be more robust and effective for complex reasoning over KGs compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) with first-order logic (FOL) queries is challenging due to the inherent incompleteness of real-world KGs and the compositional complexity of logical query structures. Most existing methods rely on embedding entities and relations into continuous geometric spaces and answer queries via differentiable set operations. While effective for simple query patterns, these approaches often struggle to generalize to complex queries involving multiple operators, deeper reasoning chains, or heterogeneous KG schemas. We propose ROG (Reasoning Over knowledge Graphs with large language models), an ensemble-style framework that combines query-aware KG neighborhood retrieval with large language model (LLM)-based chain-of-thought reasoning. ROG decomposes complex FOL queries into sequences of simpler sub-queries, retrieves compact, query-relevant subgraphs as contextual evidence, and performs step-by-step logical inference using an LLM, avoiding the need for task-specific embedding optimization. Experiments on standard KG reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ROG consistently outperforms strong embedding-based baselines in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with particularly notable gains on high-complexity query types. These results suggest that integrating structured KG retrieval with LLM-driven logical reasoning offers a robust and effective alternative for complex KG reasoning tasks.

*Amar Lakel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces new concepts to replace Large Language Models (LLM) with Large Discourse Models (LDM) and Artificial Discursive Agents (ADA), focusing on their societal roles and regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to shift the focus from the fear/fascination responses toward generative AI to a governance framework that addresses their societal impacts, uses, and limits.

Method: The authors propose an ontological framework distinguishing regulative human-machine interactions through phenomenal regularities, cognition structuring, and socio-linguistic sedimentation, reflected by these AI models.

Result: By conceptualizing LDMs as modeling human experiences through documents, the paper frames AI systems in terms broader than linguistic capabilities, emphasizing their socio-historical positioning.

Conclusion: The paper moves AI discourse toward regulatory and co-governance frameworks involving various societal sectors, aiming for proper integration and societal decoding of artificial agents.

Abstract: This paper proposes an epistemological shift in the analysis of large generative models, replacing the category ''Large Language Models'' (LLM) with that of ''Large Discourse Models'' (LDM), and then with that of Artificial Discursive Agent (ADA). The theoretical framework is based on an ontological triad distinguishing three regulatory instances: the apprehension of the phenomenal regularities of the referential world, the structuring of embodied cognition, and the structural-linguistic sedimentation of the utterance within a socio-historical context. LDMs, operating on the product of these three instances (the document), model the discursive projection of a portion of human experience reified by the learning corpus. The proposed program aims to replace the ''fascination/fear'' dichotomy with public trials and procedures that make the place, uses, and limits of artificial discursive agents in contemporary social space decipherable, situating this approach within a perspective of governance and co-regulation involving the State, industry, civil society, and academia.

*Tzu-Yun Lee,Ding-Yong Hong,Jan-Jan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Syntactic Attention Pruning (SAP), a method that incorporates syntactic structure and attention patterns into head pruning in Transformer models, enhancing both performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional pruning methods that ignore syntactic structure, aiming to improve model compression while maintaining performance and interpretability.

Method: SAP integrates linguistic features such as sentence syntax and attention patterns, alongside a Candidate Filtering (CF) mechanism to evaluate head importance before pruning.

Result: SAP achieves superior performance in preserving critical attention heads and outperforms existing pruning strategies in retrain-free scenarios.

Conclusion: SAP demonstrates the potential for combining linguistic insights with attention pruning, offering an innovative path for compressing Transformer models with enhanced flexibility and robustness.

Abstract: This paper introduces Syntactic Attention Pruning (SAP), a novel method for effectively pruning attention heads in Transformer models. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on mathematical analysis of model weights and activations, SAP incorporates both the syntactic structure and attention patterns of sentences to guide the pruning process. By leveraging these linguistic features, SAP not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods but also enhances the interpretability of model behavior. To further improve robustness, we propose Candidate Filtering (CF), a mechanism that prioritizes heads based on their contribution to model performance, mitigating degradation during pruning. Experimental results indicate that SAP effectively preserves critical heads of a high density of strong attention values, outperforming existing head pruning strategies in retrain-free settings. These findings position SAP as a promising foundation for a new direction in model compression research, offering high flexibility for pruning across all transformer-based language models.

*Zihan Lin,Xiaohan Wang,Hexiong Yang,Jiajun Chai,Jie Cao,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Advantage-Weighted Policy Optimization (AWPO) framework to integrate reasoning rewards in reinforcement learning for LLM training, confirming its effectiveness through extensive benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for LLMs focus on outcome-based rewards but neglect explicit reasoning rewards, which can drastically improve tool-use capability.

Method: The AWPO framework utilizes variance-aware gating, difficulty-aware weighting, and a tailored clipping mechanism for stable optimization, integrating reasoning and outcome rewards effectively.

Result: AWPO achieves state-of-the-art tool-use performance, outperforms strong baselines, and showcases superior parameter efficiency in multi-turn scenarios.

Conclusion: The AWPO method provides a robust way to combine reasoning and outcome rewards, enhancing performance and generalization in RL-trained LLMs.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise in training tool-use large language models (LLMs) using verifiable outcome rewards, existing methods largely overlook the potential of explicit reasoning rewards to bolster reasoning and tool utilization. Furthermore, natively combining reasoning and outcome rewards may yield suboptimal performance or conflict with the primary optimization objective. To address this, we propose advantage-weighted policy optimization (AWPO) -- a principled RL framework that effectively integrates explicit reasoning rewards to enhance tool-use capability. AWPO incorporates variance-aware gating and difficulty-aware weighting to adaptively modulate advantages from reasoning signals based on group-relative statistics, alongside a tailored clipping mechanism for stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard tool-use benchmarks, significantly outperforming strong baselines and leading closed-source models in challenging multi-turn scenarios. Notably, with exceptional parameter efficiency, our 4B model surpasses Grok-4 by 16.0 percent in multi-turn accuracy while preserving generalization capability on the out-of-distribution MMLU-Pro benchmark.

*Dehai Min,Kailin Zhang,Tongtong Wu,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuCo-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation technique that leverages external corpus statistics to improve uncertainty quantification and reduce hallucinations in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely on unreliable model-internal signals, which often lead to erroneous high-confidence outputs in large language models.

Method: QuCo-RAG incorporates a two-stage approach: pre-generation identification of long-tail knowledge gaps using low-frequency entities and in-generation entity verification through high-speed queries on pre-training data to detect hallucination risks.

Result: The system significantly improves Exact Match (EM) performance by 5–14 points on multi-hop QA benchmarks across various models and proves effective in domain generalization for biomedical QA.

Conclusion: QuCo-RAG establishes corpus-grounded verification as a robust, model-agnostic paradigm for dynamic retrieval-augmented generation, providing consistent performance gains and reducing hallucination risks.

Abstract: Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation adaptively determines when to retrieve during generation to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods rely on model-internal signals (e.g., logits, entropy), which are fundamentally unreliable because LLMs are typically ill-calibrated and often exhibit high confidence in erroneous outputs. We propose QuCo-RAG, which shifts from subjective confidence to objective statistics computed from pre-training data. Our method quantifies uncertainty through two stages: (1) before generation, we identify low-frequency entities indicating long-tail knowledge gaps; (2) during generation, we verify entity co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus, where zero co-occurrence often signals hallucination risk. Both stages leverage Infini-gram for millisecond-latency queries over 4 trillion tokens, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show QuCo-RAG achieves EM gains of 5--12 points over state-of-the-art baselines with OLMo-2 models, and transfers effectively to models with undisclosed pre-training data (Llama, Qwen, GPT), improving EM by up to 14 points. Domain generalization on biomedical QA further validates the robustness of our paradigm. These results establish corpus-grounded verification as a principled, practically model-agnostic paradigm for dynamic RAG. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhishanQ/QuCo-RAG.

### [119] [From Speech to Subtitles: Evaluating ASR Models in Subtitling Italian Television Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19161)
*Alessandro Lucca,Francesco Pierri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on Italian content and presents a cloud-based subtitling system that uses a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in assessing ASR performance on non-English, long-form content, specifically for professional subtitling of Italian videos, and to design a system meeting the media industry's standards.

Method: Four advanced ASR models were evaluated on a 50-hour dataset of Italian television programs to benchmark their performance against professional human subtitlers. A HITL workflow and cloud-based infrastructure were developed based on these findings.

Result: The ASR models showed potential for enhancing human productivity but were found insufficient for fully autonomous subtitling in a professional context. The proposed HITL system bridges this gap.

Conclusion: While ASR cannot yet replace professional subtitlers for Italian videos, integrating ASR as a tool within a HITL framework significantly boosts productivity and lays the groundwork for practical applications in media environments.

Abstract: Subtitles are essential for video accessibility and audience engagement. Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, built upon Encoder-Decoder neural network architectures and trained on massive amounts of data, have progressively reduced transcription errors on standard benchmark datasets. However, their performance in real-world production environments, particularly for non-English content like long-form Italian videos, remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a case study on developing a professional subtitling system for an Italian media company. To inform our system design, we evaluated four state-of-the-art ASR models (Whisper Large v2, AssemblyAI Universal, Parakeet TDT v3 0.6b, and WhisperX) on a 50-hour dataset of Italian television programs. The study highlights their strengths and limitations, benchmarking their performance against the work of professional human subtitlers. The findings indicate that, while current models cannot meet the media industry's accuracy needs for full autonomy, they can serve as highly effective tools for enhancing human productivity. We conclude that a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach is crucial and present the production-grade, cloud-based infrastructure we designed to support this workflow.

### [120] [JEPA-Reasoner: Decoupling Latent Reasoning from Token Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19171)
*Bingyang Kelvin Liu,Ziyu Patrick Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes JEPA-Reasoner, a JEPA-based model with generative and latent space reasoning abilities, integrated with a Talker model for human-readable output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JEPA lacks generative abilities, and transformer-based models accumulate errors during token generation, necessitating improvements in latent space reasoning and autoregressive generation.

Method: The novel JEPA-Reasoner model combines latent reasoning capabilities with a separate Talker model for interpretable action generation, decoupling reasoning from token generation.

Result: The model lays the foundation for mixed latent vector reasoning (multi-threaded reasoning) and achieves more robust autoregressive generation by reducing compounding errors.

Conclusion: Decoupling reasoning and token generation in JEPA-Reasoner improves latent reasoning and autoregressive generative tasks, showing potential for advanced machine reasoning.

Abstract: While Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has emerged as a powerful architecture for learning rich latent representations, it fundamentally lacks generative abilities. Meanwhile, latent space reasoning attempts for Transformer models like COCONUT do improve performance, but they ultimately rely on token-by-token generation, which still accumulates compounding error and relies on context information to gain reasoning insights. To address these limitations, we propose JEPA-Reasoner, a novel JEPA model enhanced with generative ability that reasons in latent space. We augment it with a separate action-taker model, Talker, to produce human-readable sentences. Our approach demonstrates that decoupling latent space reasoning and token generation enables JEPA-Reasoner to produce mixed latent vectors that might lay the foundation for multi-threaded reasoning, while performing autoregressive generation with superior robustness to compounding error.

### [121] [CycleChart: A Unified Consistency-Based Learning Framework for Bidirectional Chart Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19173)
*Dazhen Deng,Sen Yang,Yuchen He,Yuan Tian,Yingcai Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CycleChart is a framework for bidirectional chart understanding and generation, integrating tasks like question answering and parsing using a consistency-based learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the isolation of chart-specific tasks by creating a unified framework that integrates chart generation and interpretation.

Method: CycleChart uses a schema-centric formulation and a multi-task dataset with aligned annotations. It introduces a generate-parse consistency objective to achieve semantic alignment between chart generation and parsing.

Result: CycleChart achieves strong performance across chart generation, chart parsing, and chart question answering tasks, and improves cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential for unified chart understanding, moving toward models with better shared semantics across chart-related tasks.

Abstract: Current chart-specific tasks, such as chart question answering, chart parsing, and chart generation, are typically studied in isolation, preventing models from learning the shared semantics that link chart generation and interpretation. We introduce CycleChart, a consistency-based learning framework for bidirectional chart understanding and generation. CycleChart adopts a schema-centric formulation as a common interface across tasks. We construct a consistent multi-task dataset, where each chart sample includes aligned annotations for schema prediction, data parsing, and question answering. To learn cross-directional chart semantics, CycleChart introduces a generate-parse consistency objective: the model generates a chart schema from a table and a textual query, then learns to recover the schema and data from the generated chart, enforcing semantic alignment across directions. CycleChart achieves strong results on chart generation, chart parsing, and chart question answering, demonstrating improved cross-task generalization and marking a step toward more general chart understanding models.

### [122] [Identifying Features Associated with Bias Against 93 Stigmatized Groups in Language Models and Guardrail Model Safety Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19238)
*Anna-Maria Gueorguieva,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates bias in large language models (LLMs) against 93 stigmatized groups and examines the role of stigma features identified in psychology literature, discovering significant bias linked to perilous stigmas. Guardrail models reduce bias slightly, but challenges remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address bias in LLMs, especially biases towards non-protected but stigmatized groups, and explore which stigma-related social features amplify bias.

Method: The study uses SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark with 37 scenarios involving stigmatized identities, to measure bias in three LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) based on stigma characteristics (aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, peril) and evaluates guardrail models for bias mitigation.

Result: Stigmas rated high in peril had the most biased outputs (60%) while sociodemographic stigmas showed the least bias (11%). Guardrail models reduced bias by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8% for the respective LLMs, but were unable to mitigate stigma-related bias effectively.

Conclusion: Bias in LLMs is influenced by the nature of stigmatized traits, especially peril. While guardrail models help, they fail to address the deeper social feature impacts, calling for more effective bias mitigation strategies in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit social bias, however, bias towards non-protected stigmatized identities remain understudied. Furthermore, what social features of stigmas are associated with bias in LLM outputs is unknown. From psychology literature, it has been shown that stigmas contain six shared social features: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, and peril. In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%). We test if the amount of biased outputs could be decreased by using guardrail models, models meant to identify harmful input, using each LLM's respective guardrail model (Granite Guardian 3.0, Llama Guard 3.0, Mistral Moderation API). We find that bias decreases significantly by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. However, we show that features with significant effect on bias remain unchanged post-mitigation and that guardrail models often fail to recognize the intent of bias in prompts. This work has implications for using LLMs in scenarios involving stigmatized groups and we suggest future work towards improving guardrail models for bias mitigation.

### [123] [ChemATP: A Training-Free Chemical Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19240)
*Mingxu Zhang,Dazhong Shen,Qi Zhang,Ying Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChemATP, a framework that enhances LLMs' chemical reasoning by using a dynamic atom-level textual knowledge base without altering the model's parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack explicit chemical priors, limiting their capabilities in molecular science. Current methods are either constrained by static knowledge injection or lack fine-grained chemical understanding.

Method: They propose ChemATP, which decouples chemical knowledge from LLMs by using a novel atom-level textual knowledge base to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning without retraining the model.

Result: ChemATP outperforms other training-free methods and performs comparably to training-based models, showing its efficacy in precise chemical reasoning.

Conclusion: Chemical reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through explicit prior injection via external knowledge bases, avoiding the need for parameter updates while preserving the model's general intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong general reasoning but struggle in molecular science due to the lack of explicit chemical priors in standard string representations. Current solutions face a fundamental dilemma. Training-based methods inject priors into parameters, but this static coupling hinders rapid knowledge updates and often compromises the model's general reasoning capabilities. Conversely, existing training-free methods avoid these issues but rely on surface-level prompting, failing to provide the fine-grained atom-level priors essential for precise chemical reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce ChemATP, a framework that decouples chemical knowledge from the reasoning engine. By constructing the first atom-level textual knowledge base, ChemATP enables frozen LLMs to explicitly retrieve and reason over this information dynamically. This architecture ensures interpretability and adaptability while preserving the LLM's intrinsic general intelligence. Experiments show that ChemATP significantly outperforms training-free baselines and rivals state-of-the-art training-based models, demonstrating that explicit prior injection is a competitive alternative to implicit parameter updates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured prompt optimization pipeline for frame detection in logistics texts using retrieval-augmented generation, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought reasoning strategies, achieving improved inference accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance reasoning and labeling performance in domain-specific NLP tasks using LLMs without extensive fine-tuning, focusing on logistics applications.

Method: A novel prompt optimization framework is used, incorporating RAG, CoT reasoning, Auto-CoT synthesis, and iterative refinement with an LLM-based optimizer agent.

Result: Optimized prompts improve inference accuracy by up to 15% over zero-shot/static methods, with consistent performance across LLMs like GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 (72B), and LLaMA 3.1 (70B).

Conclusion: Structured prompt optimization offers scalable and generalizable solutions, presenting an alternative to full model fine-tuning for domain-specific applications like logistics text annotation.

Abstract: Prompt engineering plays a critical role in adapting large language models (LLMs) to complex reasoning and labeling tasks without the need for extensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt optimization pipeline for frame detection in logistics texts, combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and automatic CoT synthesis (Auto-CoT) to generate highly effective task-specific prompts. Central to our approach is an LLM-based prompt optimizer agent that iteratively refines the prompts using retrieved examples, performance feedback, and internal self-evaluation. Our framework is evaluated on a real-world logistics text annotation task, where reasoning accuracy and labeling efficiency are critical. Experimental results show that the optimized prompts - particularly those enhanced via Auto-CoT and RAG - improve real-world inference accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline zero-shot or static prompts. The system demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple LLMs, including GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 (72B), and LLaMA 3.1 (70B), validating its generalizability and practical value. These findings suggest that structured prompt optimization is a viable alternative to full fine-tuning, offering scalable solutions for deploying LLMs in domain-specific NLP applications such as logistics.

*Javier Vela-Tambo,Jorge Gracia,Fernando Dominguez-Castro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CienaLLM is a framework for extracting structured information from news articles about climate hazards using zero-shot generative information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of extracting structured socio-economic impact data from heterogeneous large-scale news articles related to climate hazards.

Method: The authors introduce CienaLLM, a modular framework utilizing schema-guided prompts and open-weight Large Language Models. It uses a factorial study to assess model performance and employs techniques like response parsing to enhance accuracy while using multi-step pipelines.

Result: CienaLLM outperforms a supervised baseline in accuracy for extracting drought impacts from Spanish news articles. It demonstrates efficiency gains through quantization and adaptability to different tasks by editing prompts and schemas, without retraining.

Conclusion: The schema-driven and model-agnostic design allows CienaLLM to generalize to diverse information extraction tasks and supports reproducible use by providing code, configurations, and schemas.

Abstract: Understanding and monitoring the socio-economic impacts of climate hazards requires extracting structured information from heterogeneous news articles on a large scale. To that end, we have developed CienaLLM, a modular framework based on schema-guided Generative Information Extraction. CienaLLM uses open-weight Large Language Models for zero-shot information extraction from news articles, and supports configurable prompts and output schemas, multi-step pipelines, and cloud or on-premise inference. To systematically assess how the choice of LLM family, size, precision regime, and prompting strategy affect performance, we run a large factorial study in models, precisions, and prompt engineering techniques. An additional response parsing step nearly eliminates format errors while preserving accuracy; larger models deliver the strongest and most stable performance, while quantization offers substantial efficiency gains with modest accuracy trade-offs; and prompt strategies show heterogeneous, model-specific effects. CienaLLM matches or outperforms the supervised baseline in accuracy for extracting drought impacts from Spanish news, although at a higher inference cost. While evaluated in droughts, the schema-driven and model-agnostic design is suitable for adapting to related information extraction tasks (e.g., other hazards, sectors, or languages) by editing prompts and schemas rather than retraining. We release code, configurations, and schemas to support reproducible use.

This paper proposes NystagmusNet, an AI-driven system that predicts high-risk visual environments and recommends real-time visual adaptations. Using a dual-branch convolutional neural network trained on synthetic and augmented datasets, the system estimates a photosensitivity risk score based on environmental brightness and eye movement variance. The model achieves 75% validation accuracy on synthetic data. Explainability techniques including SHAP and GradCAM are integrated to highlight environmental risk zones, improving clinical trust and model interpretability. The system includes a rule-based recommendation engine for adaptive filter suggestions. Future directions include deployment via smart glasses and reinforcement learning for personalized recommendations.

*Kaijie Chen,Zhiyang Xu,Ying Shen,Zihao Lin,Yuguang Yao,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SuperFlow, an improved RL framework for flow-based generative models, addressing inefficiencies in current methods and enhancing text-image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for flow-based generative models face inefficiencies in sampling and biased credit assignment that hinder performance and training speed.

Method: SuperFlow modifies RL training by using variance-aware sampling for group sizes and computes step-level advantages aligning with continuous-time flow dynamics.

Result: SuperFlow improves performance and efficiency, reducing training steps and time by up to 56.3% and 16.7%, respectively, while outperforming benchmarks on text-to-image tasks.

Conclusion: SuperFlow effectively resolves key issues in RL for flow-based models, achieving better alignment, visual quality, and efficiency without architectural changes.

Abstract: Recent progress in flow-based generative models and reinforcement learning (RL) has improved text-image alignment and visual quality. However, current RL training for flow models still has two main problems: (i) GRPO-style fixed per-prompt group sizes ignore variation in sampling importance across prompts, which leads to inefficient sampling and slower training; and (ii) trajectory-level advantages are reused as per-step estimates, which biases credit assignment along the flow. We propose SuperFlow, an RL training framework for flow-based models that adjusts group sizes with variance-aware sampling and computes step-level advantages in a way that is consistent with continuous-time flow dynamics. Empirically, SuperFlow reaches promising performance while using only 5.4% to 56.3% of the original training steps and reduces training time by 5.2% to 16.7% without any architectural changes. On standard text-to-image (T2I) tasks, including text rendering, compositional image generation, and human preference alignment, SuperFlow improves over SD3.5-M by 4.6% to 47.2%, and over Flow-GRPO by 1.7% to 16.0%.

TL;DR: This paper explores background bias in human action recognition models and proposes methods to mitigate it for more accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of background bias in human action recognition models, which rely more on background cues than human movement for predictions.

Method: Analysis of various models for bias, proposing segmented human input for classification models, and utilizing prompt tuning for Video Large Language Models (VLLMs).

Result: Segmented human input reduces background bias by 3.78% in classification models, and prompt tuning shifts VLLM predictions to human-focused reasoning by 9.85%.

Conclusion: Mitigation strategies like segmented input and prompt design can effectively reduce background bias, leading to improved human action recognition model performance.

Abstract: Human action recognition models often rely on background cues rather than human movement and pose to make predictions, a behavior known as background bias. We present a systematic analysis of background bias across classification models, contrastive text-image pretrained models, and Video Large Language Models (VLLM) and find that all exhibit a strong tendency to default to background reasoning. Next, we propose mitigation strategies for classification models and show that incorporating segmented human input effectively decreases background bias by 3.78%. Finally, we explore manual and automated prompt tuning for VLLMs, demonstrating that prompt design can steer predictions towards human-focused reasoning by 9.85%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCS-SupCon, a supervised contrastive learning framework using a sigmoid-based pairwise loss and style-distance constraints, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods struggle with inter-class similarities and intra-class variations and suffer from negative-sample dilution and rigid decision boundaries, especially in fine-grained recognition tasks.

Method: The proposed SCS-SupCon framework incorporates a sigmoid-based pairwise loss with learnable parameters for adaptive decision-making and style-distance constraints to disentangle style and content representations.

Result: SCS-SupCon achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmark datasets, improving accuracy on standard and fine-grained datasets while being validated through extensive ablation and statistical analyses.

Conclusion: SCS-SupCon enhances supervised contrastive learning by addressing its limitations, offering robust, generalizable, and high-performing solutions for fine-grained image classification tasks.

Abstract: Image classification is hindered by subtle inter-class differences and substantial intra-class variations, which limit the effectiveness of existing contrastive learning methods. Supervised contrastive approaches based on the InfoNCE loss suffer from negative-sample dilution and lack adaptive decision boundaries, thereby reducing discriminative power in fine-grained recognition tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon). Our framework introduces a sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias parameters to enable adaptive decision boundaries. This formulation emphasizes hard negatives, mitigates negative-sample dilution, and more effectively exploits supervision. In addition, an explicit style-distance constraint further disentangles style and content representations, leading to more robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dogs, demonstrate that SCS-SupCon achieves state-of-the-art performance across both CNN and Transformer backbones. On CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50, SCS-SupCon improves top-1 accuracy over SupCon by approximately 3.9 percentage points and over CS-SupCon by approximately 1.7 points under five-fold cross-validation. On fine-grained datasets, it outperforms CS-SupCon by 0.4--3.0 points. Extensive ablation studies and statistical analyses further confirm the robustness and generalization of the proposed framework, with Friedman tests and Nemenyi post-hoc evaluations validating the stability of the observed improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular framework powered by diffusion techniques for higher-quality 3D indoor scene reconstruction from single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods struggle with complexities like occlusions and incomplete 2D data, limiting reconstruction quality. The authors aim to address these challenges by improving occlusion recovery and geometric accuracy.

Method: The method employs diffusion-based techniques for recovering occluded views and predicting 3D shapes, incorporating modules like amodal completion for occluded instances, a layout inpainting model, hybrid depth estimation, and 2D-3D alignment for accurate scene placement.

Result: Their framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction accuracy and visual quality, as shown through experiments on the 3D-Front dataset.

Conclusion: The modular framework effectively reconstructs 3D indoor scenes from single images and offers applications in interior design, real estate, and augmented reality.

Abstract: We propose a modular framework for single-view indoor scene 3D reconstruction, where several core modules are powered by diffusion techniques. Traditional approaches for this task often struggle with the complex instance shapes and occlusions inherent in indoor environments. They frequently overshoot by attempting to predict 3D shapes directly from incomplete 2D images, which results in limited reconstruction quality. We aim to overcome this limitation by splitting the process into two steps: first, we employ diffusion-based techniques to predict the complete views of the room background and occluded indoor instances, then transform them into 3D. Our modular framework makes contributions to this field through the following components: an amodal completion module for restoring the full view of occluded instances, an inpainting model specifically trained to predict room layouts, a hybrid depth estimation technique that balances overall geometric accuracy with fine detail expressiveness, and a view-space alignment method that exploits both 2D and 3D cues to ensure precise placement of instances within the scene. This approach effectively reconstructs both foreground instances and the room background from a single image. Extensive experiments on the 3D-Front dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of both visual quality and reconstruction accuracy. The framework holds promising potential for applications in interior design, real estate, and augmented reality.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on automating tea leaf disease identification to minimize economic losses and introduces a novel dataset and ensemble model with attention modules for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tea leaf diseases pose significant challenges for farmers, leading to potential economic losses if not identified promptly. Manual identification is time-consuming and inefficient.

Method: The study created a novel dataset containing 5278 images across seven classes. Three pretrained models—DenseNet, Inception, and EfficientNet—were used alongside attention modules to enhance model performance. EfficientNet was part of the ensemble method, which also incorporates Explainable AI for interpretability.

Result: The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.68% in tea leaf disease classification.

Conclusion: Automating the identification of tea leaf diseases improves efficiency and success rates, with the proposed model showing promising results in terms of accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Tea is among the most widely consumed drinks globally. Tea production is a key industry for many countries. One of the main challenges in tea harvesting is tea leaf diseases. If the spread of tea leaf diseases is not stopped in time, it can lead to massive economic losses for farmers. Therefore, it is crucial to identify tea leaf diseases as soon as possible. Manually identifying tea leaf disease is an ineffective and time-consuming method, without any guarantee of success. Automating this process will improve both the efficiency and the success rate of identifying tea leaf diseases. The purpose of this study is to create an automated system that can classify different kinds of tea leaf diseases, allowing farmers to take action to minimize the damage. A novel dataset was developed specifically for this study. The dataset contains 5278 images across seven classes. The dataset was pre-processed prior to training the model. We deployed three pretrained models: DenseNet, Inception, and EfficientNet. EfficientNet was used only in the ensemble model. We utilized two different attention modules to improve model performance. The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.68%. Explainable AI was introduced for better model interpretability.

*Soumava Paul,Prakhar Kaushik,Ankit Vaidya,Anand Bhattad,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALIGN-Parts, a method for semantic 3D part segmentation that names and aligns parts across objects using geometric, visual, and semantic cues. It creates a unified ontology and demonstrates zero-shot matching capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for consistent part annotations in 3D object segmentation across datasets motivated this work. Existing methods lack robustness in labeling and fail to provide a complete unified segmentation framework.

Method: The approach uses bipartite assignment matching to align partlets (implicit 3D representations) with text descriptions, leveraging geometric part fields, multi-view features, and language model-based semantic cues.

Result: The method demonstrates efficient one-shot segmentation and naming, zero-shot matching to arbitrary descriptions, and creates a unified ontology across datasets. It introduces new metrics and Tex-Parts dataset examples.

Conclusion: ALIGN-Parts offers a scalable, innovative framework for semantic 3D part segmentation and naming, enhancing downstream applications and ontology creation in 3D datasets.

Abstract: We address semantic 3D part segmentation: decomposing objects into parts with meaningful names. While datasets exist with part annotations, their definitions are inconsistent across datasets, limiting robust training. Previous methods produce unlabeled decompositions or retrieve single parts without complete shape annotations. We propose ALIGN-Parts, which formulates part naming as a direct set alignment task. Our method decomposes shapes into partlets - implicit 3D part representations - matched to part descriptions via bipartite assignment. We combine geometric cues from 3D part fields, appearance from multi-view vision features, and semantic knowledge from language-model-generated affordance descriptions. Text-alignment loss ensures partlets share embedding space with text, enabling a theoretically open-vocabulary matching setup, given sufficient data. Our efficient and novel, one-shot, 3D part segmentation and naming method finds applications in several downstream tasks, including serving as a scalable annotation engine. As our model supports zero-shot matching to arbitrary descriptions and confidence-calibrated predictions for known categories, with human verification, we create a unified ontology that aligns PartNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Find3D, consisting of 1,794 unique 3D parts. We also show examples from our newly created Tex-Parts dataset. We also introduce 2 novel metrics appropriate for the named 3D part segmentation task.

TL;DR: The paper studies the comparison of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models for solving handwriting text recognition and translation challenges, especially for low-resource languages like Marathi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for efficient and accurate systems to digitize and translate handwritten legal documents in low-resource languages, aiding legal accessibility in India's district and high courts.

Method: The authors compare a two-stage OCR-MT pipeline against an end-to-end Vision Large Language Model approach, applying these to a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents.

Result: The evaluation highlights insights into the performance and capabilities of both approaches, aiming for actionable improvements in building deployable legal document processing systems.

Conclusion: The work concludes by emphasizing the potential of Vision Large Language Models for improving readability and translation of handwritten documents, especially in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) and machine translation continue to pose significant challenges, particularly for low-resource languages like Marathi, which lack large digitized corpora and exhibit high variability in handwriting styles. The conventional approach to address this involves a two-stage pipeline: an OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, which is then translated into the target language using a machine translation model. In this work, we explore and compare the performance of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models that aim to unify these stages and directly translate handwritten text images in a single, end-to-end step. Our motivation is grounded in the urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records such as FIRs, charge sheets, and witness statements in India's district and high courts. We evaluate both approaches on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, with the goal of enabling efficient legal document processing, even in low-resource environments.

*Fakrul Islam Tushar,Ehsan Samei,Cynthia Rudin,Joseph Y. Lo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents NodMAISI, a CT synthesis/augmentation framework for lung cancer screening. It improves data fidelity, lesion detectability, and malignancy classification, especially with limited clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets lack sufficient curated data on small pulmonary nodules, which are critical for lung cancer screening. Addressing this limitation can enhance diagnostic tools and research advancements.

Method: The authors developed NodMAISI, integrating a unified annotation pipeline, an anatomy-consistent synthesis framework using ControlNet-conditioned generators, and lesion-aware augmentation by controlled nodule mask perturbations.

Result: NodMAISI demonstrated higher fidelity in synthetic data, improved lesion detectability, especially for sub-centimeter nodules, and enhanced malignancy classification performance, particularly under clinical data constraints.

Conclusion: NodMAISI effectively fills a critical gap in medical imaging for lung cancer screening, providing more accurate synthesis and augmentation to improve diagnostic and classification outcomes.

Abstract: Objective: Although medical imaging datasets are increasingly available, abnormal and annotation-intensive findings critical to lung cancer screening, particularly small pulmonary nodules, remain underrepresented and inconsistently curated. Methods: We introduce NodMAISI, an anatomically constrained, nodule-oriented CT synthesis and augmentation framework trained on a unified multi-source cohort (7,042 patients, 8,841 CTs, 14,444 nodules). The framework integrates: (i) a standardized curation and annotation pipeline linking each CT with organ masks and nodule-level annotations, (ii) a ControlNet-conditioned rectified-flow generator built on MAISI-v2's foundational blocks to enforce anatomy- and lesion-consistent synthesis, and (iii) lesion-aware augmentation that perturbs nodule masks (controlled shrinkage) while preserving surrounding anatomy to generate paired CT variants. Results: Across six public test datasets, NodMAISI improved distributional fidelity relative to MAISI-v2 (real-to-synthetic FID range 1.18 to 2.99 vs 1.69 to 5.21). In lesion detectability analysis using a MONAI nodule detector, NodMAISI substantially increased average sensitivity and more closely matched clinical scans (IMD-CT: 0.69 vs 0.39; DLCS24: 0.63 vs 0.20), with the largest gains for sub-centimeter nodules where MAISI-v2 frequently failed to reproduce the conditioned lesion. In downstream nodule-level malignancy classification trained on LUNA25 and externally evaluated on LUNA16, LNDbv4, and DLCS24, NodMAISI augmentation improved AUC by 0.07 to 0.11 at <=20% clinical data and by 0.12 to 0.21 at 10%, consistently narrowing the performance gap under data scarcity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced YolovN architecture (YolovN-CBi) incorporating CBAM and BiFPN for improved small object detection, specifically for drones. It outperformed newer Yolov versions and produced lightweight, efficient distilled models for real-time deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drones present significant detection challenges due to their small size, fast movements, and low contrast. This paper aims to advance accurate and real-time drone detection systems to address these challenges.

Method: It introduces the YolovN-CBi architecture, integrating CBAM and BiFPN enhancements, accompanied by a dataset of 28K training images and a local test dataset. Various benchmarks and knowledge distillation techniques are used to evaluate performance improvements.

Result: The proposed YolovN-CBi architecture and its distilled variant improve accuracy (mAP@P0.5:0.9 of 0.6573, 6.51% higher than the teacher model) and speed (82.9% faster than baseline). These models outperform newer Yolov versions in detecting small drones.

Conclusion: The enhanced architecture and efficient distilled models demonstrated effectiveness in real-time small UAV detection, making them promising for deployment in sensitive civilian and defense scenarios.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as, drones pose increasing risks in civilian and defense settings, demanding accurate and real-time drone detection systems. However, detecting drones is challenging because of their small size, rapid movement, and low visual contrast. A modified architecture of YolovN called the YolovN-CBi is proposed that incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) to improve sensitivity to small object detections. A curated training dataset consisting of 28K images is created with various flying objects and a local test dataset is collected with 2500 images consisting of very small drone objects. The proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark datasets, along with the local test dataset. The baseline Yolov5 and the proposed Yolov5-CBi architecture outperform newer Yolo versions, including Yolov8 and Yolov12, in the speed-accuracy trade-off for small object detection. Four other variants of the proposed CBi architecture are also proposed and evaluated, which vary in the placement and usage of CBAM and BiFPN. These variants are further distilled using knowledge distillation techniques for edge deployment, using a Yolov5m-CBi teacher and a Yolov5n-CBi student. The distilled model achieved a mA@P0.5:0.9 of 0.6573, representing a 6.51% improvement over the teacher's score of 0.6171, highlighting the effectiveness of the distillation process. The distilled model is 82.9% faster than the baseline model, making it more suitable for real-time drone detection. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed CBi architecture, together with the distilled lightweight models in advancing efficient and accurate real-time detection of small UAVs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOODER, a radar-based system for real-time facial authentication and expression recognition. It achieves high accuracy and operates efficiently while preserving user privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe and privacy-preserving neural network deployment, particularly for OOD detection in facial authentication and expression recognition using radar technology.

Method: The framework utilizes low-cost FMCW radar with range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. A multi-encoder-decoder architecture detects in-distribution individuals, and expression recognition follows using ResNet and MobileViT blocks.

Result: Experiments show an AUROC of 94.13% and FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with 94.70% accuracy in expression recognition. FOODER outperforms state-of-the-art methods while operating in real time.

Conclusion: FOODER demonstrates robust and efficient OOD-based authentication and expression recognition using radar data, ensuring privacy and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of neural networks, as it enables the identification of samples outside the training domain. We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%. FOODER outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and several transformer-based architectures while operating efficiently in real time.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism effectively enhances segmentation performance and reduces retrieval costs, representing significant progress toward robust and real-time solutions for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of outdoor street scenes plays a key role in applications such as autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and assistive technology for visually-impaired pedestrians. For these applications, accurately distinguishing between key surfaces and objects such as roads, sidewalks, vehicles, and pedestrians is essential for maintaining safety and minimizing risks. Semantic segmentation must be robust to different environments, lighting and weather conditions, and sensor noise, while being performed in real-time. We propose a region-level, uncertainty-gated retrieval mechanism that improves segmentation accuracy and calibration under domain shift. Our best method achieves an 11.3% increase in mean intersection-over-union while reducing retrieval cost by 87.5%, retrieving for only 12.5% of regions compared to 100% for always-on baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SERA-H is a deep learning model that combines high-density LiDAR supervision with satellite time-series data to produce 2.5 m resolution forest height maps, outperforming many existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-off between data accessibility and spatial resolution in predicting forest canopy height maps using satellite imagery, which is essential for forest management and biodiversity monitoring.

Method: The paper introduces SERA-H, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates a super-resolution module (EDSR) and temporal attention encoding (UTAE). It is trained using high-density LiDAR data and generates high-resolution height maps from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series data.

Result: SERA-H achieves a 2.5 m resolution with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82. It outperforms Sentinel-1/2 baselines and matches or surpasses methods using commercial, high-resolution imagery.

Conclusion: SERA-H makes accurate, high-resolution forest mapping feasible using freely available data, offering a cost-effective alternative to commercial imagery with frequent revisit capabilities.

Abstract: High-resolution mapping of canopy height is essential for forest management and biodiversity monitoring. Although recent studies have led to the advent of deep learning methods using satellite imagery to predict height maps, these approaches often face a trade-off between data accessibility and spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we present SERA-H, an end-to-end model combining a super-resolution module (EDSR) and temporal attention encoding (UTAE). Trained under the supervision of high-density LiDAR data (ALS), our model generates 2.5 m resolution height maps from freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) time series data. Evaluated on an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H, with a MAE of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82, not only outperforms standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines but also achieves performance comparable to or better than methods relying on commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar). These results demonstrate that combining high-resolution supervision with the spatiotemporal information embedded in time series enables the reconstruction of details beyond the input sensors' native resolution. SERA-H opens the possibility of freely mapping forests with high revisit frequency, achieving accuracy comparable to that of costly commercial imagery.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve monocular depth estimation for endoscopic videos, addressing the need for sharp anatomical boundaries, stable predictions, and real-time processing to support tasks like robotic surgery.

Method: The method includes a single-frame depth network with endoscopy-specific transformations, Mamba temporal modules for inter-frame information propagation, and a hierarchical multi-scale supervision design with complementary loss terms.

Abstract: This work presents EndoStreamDepth, a monocular depth estimation framework for endoscopic video streams. It provides accurate depth maps with sharp anatomical boundaries for each frame, temporally consistent predictions across frames, and real-time throughput. Unlike prior work that uses batched inputs, EndoStreamDepth processes individual frames with a temporal module to propagate inter-frame information. The framework contains three main components: (1) a single-frame depth network with endoscopy-specific transformation to produce accurate depth maps, (2) multi-level Mamba temporal modules that leverage inter-frame information to improve accuracy and stabilize predictions, and (3) a hierarchical design with comprehensive multi-scale supervision, where complementary loss terms jointly improve local boundary sharpness and global geometric consistency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two publicly available colonoscopy depth estimation datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods, EndoStreamDepth substantially improves performance, and it produces depth maps with sharp, anatomically aligned boundaries, which are essential to support downstream tasks such as automation for robotic surgery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 3D patch-based diffusion model to generate high-resolution 3D images efficiently and accurately, addressing challenges in 3D CT reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the computational challenges of directly training diffusion models on 3D data and to fully leverage the potential of diffusion models for high-dimensional 3D image reconstruction.

Method: The method involves learning the prior of 3D patches to ensure scalability, while integrating local and global information by coupling position-aware 3D local patches with downsampled global 3D volumes.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in high-resolution 3D CT reconstruction, with results showing $512 \times 512 \times 256$ resolution in approximately 20 minutes.

Conclusion: This approach enables unprecedented efficiency and performance in high-resolution 3D image generation and reconstruction, solving scalability issues in real-world applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models learn strong image priors that can be leveraged to solve inverse problems like medical image reconstruction. However, for real-world applications such as 3D Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, directly training diffusion models on 3D data presents significant challenges due to the high computational demands of extensive GPU resources and large-scale datasets. Existing works mostly reuse 2D diffusion priors to address 3D inverse problems, but fail to fully realize and leverage the generative capacity of diffusion models for high-dimensional data. In this study, we propose a novel 3D patch-based diffusion model that can learn a fully 3D diffusion prior from limited data, enabling scalable generation of high-resolution 3D images. Our core idea is to learn the prior of 3D patches to achieve scalable efficiency, while coupling local and global information to guarantee high-quality 3D image generation, by modeling the joint distribution of position-aware 3D local patches and downsampled 3D volume as global context. Our approach not only enables high-quality 3D generation, but also offers an unprecedentedly efficient and accurate solution to high-resolution 3D inverse problems. Experiments on 3D CT reconstruction across multiple datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency, notably achieving high-resolution 3D reconstruction of $512 \times 512 \times 256$ ($\sim$20 mins).

TL;DR: The study presents AtlasSegFM, a framework that customizes foundation models for clinical image segmentation using a single annotated image and atlas guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of interactive foundation models that rely on precise prompts and perform poorly on underrepresented clinical data in their training.

Method: AtlasSegFM uses atlas-based image registration to create context-aware prompts and incorporates a test-time adapter for combining predictions from the atlas and foundation models.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse datasets confirm that AtlasSegFM improves segmentation performance, especially for challenging small and delicate structures.

Conclusion: AtlasSegFM offers an effective and deployable solution for adapting foundation models to specific clinical needs with minimal customization efforts, enabling real-world integration.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While recent interactive foundation models (e.g., nnInteractive) enhance generalization through large-scale multimodal pretraining, they still depend on precise prompts and often perform below expectations in contexts that are underrepresented in their training data. We present AtlasSegFM, an atlas-guided framework that customizes available foundation models to clinical contexts with a single annotated example. The core innovations are: 1) a pipeline that provides context-aware prompts for foundation models via registration between a context atlas and query images, and 2) a test-time adapter to fuse predictions from both atlas registration and the foundation model. Extensive experiments across public and in-house datasets spanning multiple modalities and organs demonstrate that AtlasSegFM consistently improves segmentation, particularly for small, delicate structures. AtlasSegFM provides a lightweight, deployable solution one-shot customization of foundation models in real-world clinical workflows. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper presents MACE-Dance, a framework for music-driven dance video generation focusing on both realistic motions and high-quality appearances, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growth of online dance-video platforms and AI-generated content, there is a need to improve music-driven dance generation in terms of realistic motion and high-quality visuals.

Method: The framework, MACE-Dance, uses a cascaded Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design: the Motion Expert handles music-to-3D motion generation with a hybrid architecture and the Appearance Expert generates motion-conditioned videos while ensuring identity and temporal coherence.

Result: MACE-Dance achieves state-of-the-art performance in both music-to-3D motion generation and pose-driven image animation, as supported by a curated dataset and evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: MACE-Dance sets a benchmark for music-driven dance video generation, combining both kinematic plausibility and aesthetic quality, filling a gap in the field.

Abstract: With the rise of online dance-video platforms and rapid advances in AI-generated content (AIGC), music-driven dance generation has emerged as a compelling research direction. Despite substantial progress in related domains such as music-driven 3D dance generation, pose-driven image animation, and audio-driven talking-head synthesis, existing methods cannot be directly adapted to this task. Moreover, the limited studies in this area still struggle to jointly achieve high-quality visual appearance and realistic human motion. Accordingly, we present MACE-Dance, a music-driven dance video generation framework with cascaded Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). The Motion Expert performs music-to-3D motion generation while enforcing kinematic plausibility and artistic expressiveness, whereas the Appearance Expert carries out motion- and reference-conditioned video synthesis, preserving visual identity with spatiotemporal coherence. Specifically, the Motion Expert adopts a diffusion model with a BiMamba-Transformer hybrid architecture and a Guidance-Free Training (GFT) strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 3D dance generation. The Appearance Expert employs a decoupled kinematic-aesthetic fine-tuning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in pose-driven image animation. To better benchmark this task, we curate a large-scale and diverse dataset and design a motion-appearance evaluation protocol. Based on this protocol, MACE-Dance also achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://macedance.github.io/

TL;DR: The paper explores an optimized approach to flow matching in generative models, proposing improvements to training and sampling strategies for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional Gaussian distributions used in flow matching generative modeling.

Method: Proposes a 2D simulation for interpreting high-dimensional geometry, derives key observations, and introduces a framework combining norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling.

Result: The new method demonstrates improved generative quality and sampling efficiency in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into source distribution design and introduces a technique for enhancing flow matching models without retraining.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful generative modeling approach with flexible choices of source distribution. While Gaussian distributions are commonly used, the potential for better alternatives in high-dimensional data generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D simulation that captures high-dimensional geometric properties in an interpretable 2D setting, enabling us to analyze the learning dynamics of flow matching during training. Based on this analysis, we derive several key insights about flow matching behavior: (1) density approximation can paradoxically degrade performance due to mode discrepancy, (2) directional alignment suffers from path entanglement when overly concentrated, (3) Gaussian's omnidirectional coverage ensures robust learning, and (4) norm misalignment incurs substantial learning costs. Building on these insights, we propose a practical framework that combines norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling. This approach maintains the robust omnidirectional supervision essential for stable flow learning, while eliminating initializations in data-sparse regions during inference. Importantly, our pruning strategy can be applied to any flow matching model trained with a Gaussian source, providing immediate performance gains without the need for retraining. Empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements in both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Our findings provide practical insights and guidelines for source distribution design and introduce a readily applicable technique for improving existing flow matching models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve query initialization methods for query-based 3D object detection, addressing inefficiencies and accuracy reductions in handling occluded or crowded objects.

Method: Three components: Occlusion-aware Center Estimation, Adaptive Neighbor Sampling, and Dynamic Query Balancing, combining LiDAR geometry and image semantics for robust query initialization.

Result: ALIGN enhances performance on the nuScenes benchmark, showing up to +0.9 mAP and +1.2 NDS improvements in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: ALIGN provides a more efficient and accurate query-based 3D detection approach, especially beneficial for occlusion-robust scenarios, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent query-based 3D object detection methods using camera and LiDAR inputs have shown strong performance, but existing query initialization strategies,such as random sampling or BEV heatmap-based sampling, often result in inefficient query usage and reduced accuracy, particularly for occluded or crowded objects. To address this limitation, we propose ALIGN (Advanced query initialization with LiDAR and Image GuidaNce), a novel approach for occlusion-robust, object-aware query initialization. Our model consists of three key components: (i) Occlusion-aware Center Estimation (OCE), which integrates LiDAR geometry and image semantics to estimate object centers accurately (ii) Adaptive Neighbor Sampling (ANS), which generates object candidates from LiDAR clustering and supplements each object by sampling spatially and semantically aligned points around it and (iii) Dynamic Query Balancing (DQB), which adaptively balances queries between foreground and background regions. Our extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves performance across multiple state-of-the-art detectors, achieving gains of up to +0.9 mAP and +1.2 NDS, particularly in challenging scenes with occlusions or dense crowds. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for discovering object-centric representations in images, highlighting improvements in robustness and accuracy, and introduces benchmarks for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current object-centric representation methods, particularly their struggle in recognizing multi-part objects in occluded and out-of-distribution contexts.

Method: The authors developed a novel approach that utilizes explicit graph representations for object parts and a co-part object discovery algorithm. They also introduced benchmarks to assess method performance under varying conditions.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art techniques in discovering objects, solving occlusion and out-of-distribution recognition challenges, and predicting object properties more effectively in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the robustness and accuracy of object-centric representations and demonstrates potential for broader applications in vision-related tasks.

Abstract: Discovering object-centric representations from images can significantly enhance the robustness, sample efficiency and generalizability of vision models. Works on images with multi-part objects typically follow an implicit object representation approach, which fail to recognize these learned objects in occluded or out-of-distribution contexts. This is due to the assumption that object part-whole relations are implicitly encoded into the representations through indirect training objectives. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method that leverages on explicit graph representations for parts and present a co-part object discovery algorithm. We then introduce three benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of object-centric methods in recognizing multi-part objects within occluded and out-of-distribution settings. Experimental results on simulated, realistic, and real-world images show marked improvements in the quality of discovered objects compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as the accurate recognition of multi-part objects in occluded and out-of-distribution contexts. We also show that the discovered object-centric representations can more accurately predict key object properties in a downstream task, highlighting the potential of our method to advance the field of object-centric representations.

Motivation: To address the lack of an integrated approach to evaluating factors influencing spatial openness in residential housing, aiming to improve design and quality.

Method: Analyzed 2D openness via visibility graph analysis and 3D openness using the Mask2Former model on rental housing data in Tokyo.

Result: Found temporal and spatial variations in openness, with a 1990s peak and partial correlations linking openness to rent and urban trends.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a multidimensional data-driven method for assessing spatial openness, highlighting its influence on urban redevelopment and market dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding spatial openness is vital for improving residential quality and design; however, studies often treat its influencing factors separately. This study developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the spatial openness in housing from two- (2D) and three- (3D) dimensional perspectives. Using data from 4,004 rental units in Tokyo's 23 wards, we examined the temporal and spatial variations in openness and its relationship with rent and housing attributes. 2D openness was computed via planar visibility using visibility graph analysis (VGA) from floor plans, whereas 3D openness was derived from interior images analysed using Mask2Former, a semantic segmentation model that identifies walls, ceilings, floors, and windows. The results showed an increase in living room visibility and a 1990s peak in overall openness. Spatial analyses revealed partial correlations among openness, rent, and building characteristics, reflecting urban redevelopment trends. Although the 2D and 3D openness indicators were not directly correlated, higher openness tended to correspond to higher rent. The impression scores predicted by the existing models were only weakly related to openness, suggesting that the interior design and furniture more strongly shape perceived space. This study offers a new multidimensional data-driven framework for quantifying residential spatial openness and linking it with urban and market dynamics.

### [150] [Investigating Spatial Attention Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18231)
*Aryan Chaudhary,Sanchit Goyal,Pratik Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models exhibit a bias in describing left-positioned content first in horizontally concatenated images, observed in 97% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize spatial attention biases in Vision-Language Models, especially left-positioned bias in horizontally concatenated images.

Method: Conduct controlled experiments with open-source and closed-source VLMs, including Arabic-finetuned models, and analyze training dataset guidelines to investigate the root causes of the bias.

Result: The left-positioned bias is consistently observed across architectures and persists even in models trained under right-to-left language settings.

Conclusion: The study highlights architectural limitations in spatial processing of Vision-Language Models, unrelated to language reading direction or explicit training data annotations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding visual content, yet systematic biases in their spatial processing remain largely unexplored. This work identifies and characterizes a systematic spatial attention bias where VLMs consistently prioritize describing left-positioned content before right-positioned content in horizontally concatenated images. Through controlled experiments on image pairs using both open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that this bias persists across different architectures, with models describing left-positioned content first in approximately 97% of cases under neutral prompting conditions. Testing on an Arabic-finetuned model reveals that the bias persists despite right-to-left language training, ruling out language reading direction as the primary cause. Investigation of training dataset annotation guidelines from PixMo and Visual Genome reveals no explicit left-first ordering instructions, suggesting the bias is consistent with architectural factors rather than explicit training data instructions. These findings reveal fundamental limitations in how current VLMs process spatial information.

### [151] [Joint Learning of Depth, Pose, and Local Radiance Field for Large Scale Monocular 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18237)
*Shahram Najam Syed,Yitian Hu,Yuchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that addresses challenges in photorealistic 3-D reconstruction from monocular video in large-scale scenes, achieving accurate reconstruction and high-quality view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail in large-scale monocular 3-D reconstruction due to issues like depth ambiguity, pose drift, and limitations in global scene representation.

Method: The proposed system uses Vision-Transformer depth networks for metric-scale depth estimation, feature-based bundle-adjustment for pose refinement, and a modular hash-grid NeRF hierarchy for scalable scene representation.

Result: On the Tanks and Temples benchmark, the method achieved significant improvements in trajectory and pose error compared to prior approaches, enabling city-block-scale reconstructions on a single GPU.

Conclusion: Metric-scale, drift-free 3-D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis from uncalibrated RGB cameras are feasible using the joint learning framework introduced.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3-D reconstruction from monocular video collapses in large-scale scenes when depth, pose, and radiance are solved in isolation: scale-ambiguous depth yields ghost geometry, long-horizon pose drift corrupts alignment, and a single global NeRF cannot model hundreds of metres of content. We introduce a joint learning framework that couples all three factors and demonstrably overcomes each failure case. Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories. For scene representation, we deploy an incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy: new hash-grid NeRFs are allocated and frozen on-the-fly when view overlap falls below a threshold, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU. Evaluated on the Tanks and Temples benchmark, our method reduces Absolute Trajectory Error to 0.001-0.021 m across eight indoor-outdoor sequences--up to 18x lower than BARF and 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF--while maintaining sub-pixel Relative Pose Error. These results demonstrate that metric-scale, drift-free 3-D reconstruction and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis are achievable from a single uncalibrated RGB camera.

*Pan Ben Wong,Chengli Wu,Hanyue Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SG-RIFE introduces semantic guidance into the RIFE framework for video frame interpolation, improving perceptual quality without sacrificing real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based VFI methods struggle with complex scenarios like large motion and occlusion, while diffusion-based methods excel in perceptual quality but are too slow for real-time use.

Method: The paper integrates semantic priors from a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer into a pre-trained RIFE model using fine-tuning. It introduces Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM) and Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF) to align features effectively.

Result: SG-RIFE demonstrates improved perceptual fidelity, surpasses diffusion-based models in FID/LPIPS metrics, matches state-of-the-art quality in benchmarks, and operates significantly faster.

Conclusion: Semantic consistency significantly enhances flow-based VFI methods to achieve high perceptual quality while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Real-time Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) has long been dominated by flow-based methods like RIFE, which offer high throughput but often fail in complicated scenarios involving large motion and occlusion. Conversely, recent diffusion-based approaches (e.g., Consec. BB) achieve state-of-the-art perceptual quality but suffer from prohibitive latency, rendering them impractical for real-time applications. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-Guided RIFE (SG-RIFE). Instead of training from scratch, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that augments a pre-trained RIFE backbone with semantic priors from a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer. We propose a Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM) to compress and refine high-dimensional features, and a Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF) module to align these semantic priors with pixel-level motion fields. Experiments on SNU-FILM demonstrate that semantic injection provides a decisive boost in perceptual fidelity. SG-RIFE outperforms diffusion-based LDMVFI in FID/LPIPS and achieves quality comparable to Consec. BB on complex benchmarks while running significantly faster, proving that semantic consistency enables flow-based methods to achieve diffusion-competitive perceptual quality in near real-time.

*Xiao He,Chang Tang,Xinwang Liu,Wei Zhang,Zhimin Gao,Chuankun Li,Shaohua Qiu,Jiangfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method, SDCM, to address challenges in object detection within hyperspectral images, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images reveal subtle differences between substances but face challenges such as inconsistency among hyperspectral bands and sensor interferences.

Method: Proposes the SDCM framework, including SCL for inter-band consistency, SGG for removing redundant spectral data, and SDA for enriched semantic representation.

Result: Experimentation on two hyperspectral datasets shows that SDCM outperforms other methods.

Conclusion: The method improves hyperspectral image object detection by addressing inter-band redundancies and inconsistencies through advanced semantic and spectral processing techniques.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images with high spectral resolution provide new insights into recognizing subtle differences in similar substances. However, object detection in hyperspectral images faces significant challenges in intra- and inter-class similarity due to the spatial differences in hyperspectral inter-bands and unavoidable interferences, e.g., sensor noises and illumination. To alleviate the hyperspectral inter-bands inconsistencies and redundancy, we propose a novel network termed \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{D}iscrepancy and \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal semantic consistency learning (SDCM), which facilitates the extraction of consistent information across a wide range of hyperspectral bands while utilizing the spectral dimension to pinpoint regions of interest. Specifically, we leverage a semantic consistency learning (SCL) module that utilizes inter-band contextual cues to diminish the heterogeneity of information among bands, yielding highly coherent spectral dimension representations. On the other hand, we incorporate a spectral gated generator (SGG) into the framework that filters out the redundant data inherent in hyperspectral information based on the importance of the bands. Then, we design the spectral discrepancy aware (SDA) module to enrich the semantic representation of high-level information by extracting pixel-level spectral features. Extensive experiments on two hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared with other ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset and a novel framework named APSNet for classifying ancient plant seeds, achieving 90.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the research gap in archaeobotanical data and methods, specifically in the classification of ancient plant seeds, which is essential to understand human-environment interactions and overcome inefficiencies of traditional expert-based studies.

Method: The authors constructed the APS dataset with 8,340 images of seeds from 17 categories and proposed APSNet, incorporating a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module to leverage size information and an Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) mechanism for efficient feature learning.

Result: Their APSNet framework achieved a classification accuracy of 90.5%, surpassing state-of-the-art image classification techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and APSNet framework present an effective tool for systematic archaeological research, offering innovations in archaeobotany and advancing intelligent analysis methods in this field.

Abstract: Understanding the dietary preferences of ancient societies and their evolution across periods and regions is crucial for revealing human-environment interactions. Seeds, as important archaeological artifacts, represent a fundamental subject of archaeobotanical research. However, traditional studies rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key "evidence" for sufficient classification. Specifically, we design a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module in the encoder part to explicitly extract size information for the purpose of complementing fine-grained information. We propose an Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) architecture based on traditional progressive learning to decode features from both channel and spatial perspectives, enabling efficient learning of discriminative features. In both quantitative and qualitative analyses, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art image classification methods, achieving an accuracy of 90.5%. This demonstrates that our work provides an effective tool for large-scale, systematic archaeological research.

### [155] [Loom: Diffusion-Transformer for Interleaved Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18254)
*Mingcheng Ye,Jiaming Liu,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Loom, a framework for generating interleaved text and images for tasks like style transfer and tutorials, achieving significantly better output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work focuses on creating a unified approach for interleaved text-image generation to improve coherence, temporal alignment, and compositionality in such outputs.

Method: Loom combines diffusion and transformer architectures with interleaved textual and visual embeddings and utilizes stepwise prompts for long-horizon generation.

Result: Loom outperformed the Anole baseline by an average of 2.6 points across metrics and showed strong results on a newly curated 50K tutorial dataset.

Conclusion: Loom offers a promising solution for interleaved text-image tasks, outperforming prior models in semantic and temporal quality.

Abstract: Interleaved text-image generation aims to jointly produce coherent visual frames and aligned textual descriptions within a single sequence, enabling tasks such as style transfer, compositional synthesis, and procedural tutorials. We present Loom, a unified diffusion-transformer framework for interleaved text-image generation. Loom extends the Bagel unified model via full-parameter fine-tuning and an interleaved architecture that alternates textual and visual embeddings for multi-condition reasoning and sequential planning. A language planning strategy first decomposes a user instruction into stepwise prompts and frame embeddings, which guide temporally consistent synthesis. For each frame, Loom conditions on a small set of sampled prior frames together with the global textual context, rather than concatenating all history, yielding controllable and efficient long-horizon generation. Across style transfer, compositional generation, and tutorial-like procedures, Loom delivers superior compositionality, temporal coherence, and text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that Loom substantially outperforms the open-source baseline Anole, achieving an average gain of 2.6 points (on a 5-point scale) across temporal and semantic metrics in text-to-interleaved tasks. We also curate a 50K interleaved tutorial dataset and demonstrate strong improvements over unified and diffusion editing baselines.

*Yucheng Fan,Jiawei Chen,Yu Tian,Zhaoxia Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy concerns caused by attribute inference attacks via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by presenting a novel protection method and an accompanying evaluation dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising privacy concerns due to VLM-based attribute inference attacks on social media images necessitate a balanced approach that both protects privacy and retains user experience.

Method: The authors developed a method optimizing privacy suppression and utility preservation while maintaining visual consistency. Additionally, they introduced VPI-COCO, a public dataset for fine-grained evaluation.

Result: Experiments using the VPI-COCO dataset showed significant reductions in privacy inference rates (PAR below 25%), maintained high levels of user experience (NPAR above 88%), and visual consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves an effective trade-off between privacy preservation and user experience, making it applicable for practical deployments of VLMs in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) become widely adopted, VLM-based attribute inference attacks have emerged as a serious privacy concern, enabling adversaries to infer private attributes from images shared on social media. This escalating threat calls for dedicated protection methods to safeguard user privacy. However, existing methods often degrade the visual quality of images or interfere with vision-based functions on social media, thereby failing to achieve a desirable balance between privacy protection and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a novel protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation under a visual consistency constraint. While our method is conceptually effective, fair comparisons between methods remain challenging due to the lack of publicly available evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce VPI-COCO, a publicly available benchmark comprising 522 images with hierarchically structured privacy questions and corresponding non-private counterparts, enabling fine-grained and joint evaluation of protection methods in terms of privacy preservation and user experience. Building upon this benchmark, experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces PAR below 25%, keeps NPAR above 88%, maintains high visual consistency, and generalizes well to unseen and paraphrased privacy questions, demonstrating its strong practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for detecting visual dark patterns in user interfaces, achieving high accuracy and real-time performance using YOLOv12x object detection with transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing prevalence of undermining user choices through interface designs (dark patterns) and provide proactive detection methods beyond regulatory reactive approaches.

Method: The framework uses YOLOv12x for object detection, enhanced by transfer learning, and relies on a proprietary dataset of 4,066 annotated screenshots with dark patterns.

Result: The proposed model achieves 92.8% detection accuracy (mAP@50) and operates at 40.5 FPS, validating real-time practical applicability.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates an effective approach for real-time visual dark pattern detection, releasing its dataset to encourage further research and development.

Abstract: With the accelerating pace of digital transformation and the widespread adoption of online platforms, both social and technical concerns regarding dark patterns-user interface designs that undermine users' ability to make informed and rational choices-have become increasingly prominent. As corporate online platforms grow more sophisticated in their design strategies, there is a pressing need for proactive and real-time detection technologies that go beyond the predominantly reactive approaches employed by regulatory authorities. In this paper, we propose a visual dark pattern detection framework that improves both detection accuracy and real-time performance. To this end, we constructed a proprietary visual object detection dataset by manually collecting 4,066 UI/UX screenshots containing dark patterns from 194 websites across six major industrial sectors in South Korea and abroad. The collected images were annotated with five representative UI components commonly associated with dark patterns: Button, Checkbox, Input Field, Pop-up, and QR Code. This dataset has been publicly released to support further research and development in the field. To enable real-time detection, this study adopted the YOLOv12x object detection model and applied transfer learning to optimize its performance for visual dark pattern recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high detection accuracy of 92.8% in terms of mAP@50, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 40.5 frames per second (FPS), confirming its effectiveness for practical deployment in online environments. Furthermore, to facilitate future research and contribute to technological advancements, the dataset constructed in this study has been made publicly available at https://github.com/B4E2/B4E2-DarkPattern-YOLO-DataSet.

TL;DR: UniMPR proposes a unified framework for multimodal place recognition, addressing challenges like arbitrary modality inputs, missing modalities, and diverse sensor setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multimodal place recognition, such as adapting to varying inputs, robustness against missing/degraded data, and generalization across sensor setups.

Method: A unified framework using polar BEV feature space and multi-branch networks to handle diverse sensor modalities. Extensive pre-training with a large dataset and adaptive label assignment bolster generalization.

Result: UniMPR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven datasets, demonstrating adaptability to different sensors, modality combinations, and environments.

Conclusion: UniMPR effectively tackles key challenges in multimodal place recognition, offering a robust and adaptable solution for autonomous systems in GPS-denied environments.

Abstract: Place recognition is a critical component of autonomous vehicles and robotics, enabling global localization in GPS-denied environments. Recent advances have spurred significant interest in multimodal place recognition (MPR), which leverages complementary strengths of multiple modalities. Despite its potential, most existing MPR methods still face three key challenges: (1) dynamically adapting to arbitrary modality inputs within a unified framework, (2) maintaining robustness with missing or degraded modalities, and (3) generalizing across diverse sensor configurations and setups. In this paper, we propose UniMPR, a unified framework for multimodal place recognition. Using only one trained model, it can seamlessly adapt to any combination of common perceptual modalities (e.g., camera, LiDAR, radar). To tackle the data heterogeneity, we unify all inputs within a polar BEV feature space. Subsequently, the polar BEVs are fed into a multi-branch network to exploit discriminative intra-model and inter-modal features from any modality combinations. To fully exploit the network's generalization capability and robustness, we construct a large-scale training set from multiple datasets and introduce an adaptive label assignment strategy for extensive pre-training. Experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that UniMPR achieves state-of-the-art performance under varying sensor configurations, modality combinations, and environmental conditions. Our code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/UniMPR.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACGNet, a novel architecture for enhanced object detection in aerial imagery by addressing feature fusion challenges. It achieves benchmark-setting performance on specific datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in object detection for aerial imagery, like cross-modal noise and disrupted hierarchical structures caused by simplistic feature fusion strategies.

Method: The paper proposes PACGNet, incorporating two key modules: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) to reduce noise and enhance complementary features, and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) to maintain fine-grained details in a hierarchical structure.

Result: PACGNet achieves new state-of-the-art results on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets, with mAP50 scores of 81.7% and 82.1%, respectively.

Conclusion: PACGNet advances the field of object detection in aerial imagery by offering a refined fusion strategy, enhancing feature representation and achieving superior detection performance.

Abstract: Object detection in aerial imagery is a critical task in applications such as UAV reconnaissance. Although existing methods have extensively explored feature interaction between different modalities, they commonly rely on simple fusion strategies for feature aggregation. This introduces two critical flaws: it is prone to cross-modal noise and disrupts the hierarchical structure of the feature pyramid, thereby impairing the fine-grained detection of small objects. To address this challenge, we propose the Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating Network (PACGNet), an architecture designed to perform deep fusion within the backbone. To this end, we design two core components: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module. The SCG module employs a bidirectional, symmetrical "horizontal" gating mechanism to selectively absorb complementary information, suppress noise, and preserve the semantic integrity of each modality. The PFMG module reconstructs the feature hierarchy via a progressive hierarchical gating mechanism. This leverages the detailed features from a preceding, higher-resolution level to guide the fusion at the current, lower-resolution level, effectively preserving fine-grained details as features propagate. Through evaluations conducted on the DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets, our PACGNet sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark, with mAP50 scores reaching 81.7% and 82.1% respectively.

TL;DR: MatE is a method to generate tileable physically-based rendering (PBR) materials from real-world, casual images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize the generation of high-fidelity PBR materials and remove dependency on specialized equipment and expertise.

Method: MatE uses a depth map for coarse rectification and employs a dual-branch diffusion model to correct residual distortions and generate material maps, including albedo, normal, roughness, and height.

Result: The approach is invariant to illumination and perspective, enabling accurate material property recovery. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: MatE allows users to easily create realistic materials from single casual images, overcoming traditional bottlenecks in PBR material generation.

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity, physically-based rendering (PBR) materials remains a bottleneck in many graphics pipelines, typically requiring specialized equipment and expert-driven post-processing. To democratize this process, we present MatE, a novel method for generating tileable PBR materials from a single image taken under unconstrained, real-world conditions. Given an image and a user-provided mask, MatE first performs coarse rectification using an estimated depth map as a geometric prior, and then employs a dual-branch diffusion model. Leveraging a learned consistency from rotation-aligned and scale-aligned training data, this model further rectify residual distortions from the coarse result and translate it into a complete set of material maps, including albedo, normal, roughness and height. Our framework achieves invariance to the unknown illumination and perspective of the input image, allowing for the recovery of intrinsic material properties from casual captures. Through comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach, enabling users to create realistic materials from real-world image.

*Philipp Langsteiner,Jan-Niklas Dihlmann,Hendrik P. A. Lensch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap between 2D material parameter predictions and their integration into 3D geometries by proposing a novel framework combining Gaussian Splatting and neural refinement for relightable, photorealistic reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual modeling of materials is time-intensive, and although 3D reconstruction advances exist, they lack precise material parameterization for relighting. The integration of predicted 2D material parameters into 3D geometries is a key challenge.

Method: The framework involves reconstructing scene geometry using Gaussian Splatting and generating 2D material maps (albedo, roughness, metallicity) via diffusion models. These maps are then integrated into 3D geometry using either image-based loss optimization or Gaussian ray tracing, followed by a Neural Merger for fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing methods in quantitative metrics and visual realism, improving material accuracy, consistency, and relightability in reconstructed scenes.

Conclusion: The method substantially enhances photorealistic rendering and relighting capabilities, boosting realism and efficiency for content creation workflows in gaming and film.

Abstract: Manual modeling of material parameters and 3D geometry is a time consuming yet essential task in the gaming and film industries. While recent advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate approximations of scene geometry and appearance, these methods often fall short in relighting scenarios due to the lack of precise, spatially varying material parameters. At the same time, diffusion models operating on 2D images have shown strong performance in predicting physically based rendering (PBR) properties such as albedo, roughness, and metallicity. However, transferring these 2D material maps onto reconstructed 3D geometry remains a significant challenge. We propose a framework for fusing 2D material data into 3D geometry using a combination of novel learning-based and projection-based approaches. We begin by reconstructing scene geometry via Gaussian Splatting. From the input images, a diffusion model generates 2D maps for albedo, roughness, and metallic parameters. Any existing diffusion model that can convert images or videos to PBR materials can be applied. The predictions are further integrated into the 3D representation either by optimizing an image-based loss or by directly projecting the material parameters onto the Gaussians using Gaussian ray tracing. To enhance fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency, we further introduce a light-weight neural refinement step (Neural Merger), which takes ray-traced material features as input and produces detailed adjustments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques in both quantitative metrics and perceived visual realism. This enables more accurate, relightable, and photorealistic renderings from reconstructed scenes, significantly improving the realism and efficiency of asset creation workflows in content production pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in balancing global and local feature extraction in current bone age assessment methods, aiming to create a more accurate and efficient automated system.

Method: The BoNet+ model employs two streams: a global feature extraction channel with a Transformer module and a local feature channel with an RFAConv module. Features are concatenated and processed through the Inception-V3 network.

Result: BoNet+ achieved mean absolute errors of 3.81 and 5.65 months on RSNA and RHPE datasets respectively, comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BoNet+ effectively reduces clinical workload and enables automated, accurate, and objective bone age assessment.

Abstract: Bone Age Assessment (BAA) is a widely used clinical technique that can accurately reflect an individual's growth and development level, as well as maturity. In recent years, although deep learning has advanced the field of bone age assessment, existing methods face challenges in efficiently balancing global features and local skeletal details. This study aims to develop an automated bone age assessment system based on a two-stream deep learning architecture to achieve higher accuracy in bone age assessment. We propose the BoNet+ model incorporating global and local feature extraction channels. A Transformer module is introduced into the global feature extraction channel to enhance the ability in extracting global features through multi-head self-attention mechanism. A RFAConv module is incorporated into the local feature extraction channel to generate adaptive attention maps within multiscale receptive fields, enhancing local feature extraction capabilities. Global and local features are concatenated along the channel dimension and optimized by an Inception-V3 network. The proposed method has been validated on the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and Radiological Hand Pose Estimation (RHPE) test datasets, achieving mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 3.81 and 5.65 months, respectively. These results are comparable to the state-of-the-art. The BoNet+ model reduces the clinical workload and achieves automatic, high-precision, and more objective bone age assessment.

Result: MCVI-SANet achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in estimating LAI (R2: 0.8123; RMSE: 0.4796) and SPAD (R2: 0.6846; RMSE: 2.4222), outperforming baselines with substantial percentage improvements.

Conclusion: The integration of semi-supervised learning and agronomic priors in MCVI-SANet sets a promising standard for remote sensing-based precision agriculture, with high accuracy and lightweight design.

Abstract: Vegetation index (VI) saturation during the dense canopy stage and limited ground-truth annotations of winter wheat constrain accurate estimation of LAI and SPAD. Existing VI-based and texture-driven machine learning methods exhibit limited feature expressiveness. In addition, deep learning baselines suffer from domain gaps and high data demands, which restrict their generalization. Therefore, this study proposes the Multi-Channel Vegetation Indices Saturation Aware Net (MCVI-SANet), a lightweight semi-supervised vision model. The model incorporates a newly designed Vegetation Index Saturation-Aware Block (VI-SABlock) for adaptive channel-spatial feature enhancement. It also integrates a VICReg-based semi-supervised strategy to further improve generalization. Datasets were partitioned using a vegetation height-informed strategy to maintain representativeness across growth stages. Experiments over 10 repeated runs demonstrate that MCVI-SANet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The model attains an average R2 of 0.8123 and RMSE of 0.4796 for LAI, and an average R2 of 0.6846 and RMSE of 2.4222 for SPAD. This performance surpasses the best-performing baselines, with improvements of 8.95% in average LAI R2 and 8.17% in average SPAD R2. Moreover, MCVI-SANet maintains high inference speed with only 0.10M parameters. Overall, the integration of semi-supervised learning with agronomic priors provides a promising approach for enhancing remote sensing-based precision agriculture.

*Dunxing Zhang,Jiachen Lu,Han Yang,Lei Bao,Bo Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESSC-RM is a refinement framework for SSC models, improving semantic prediction through multiscale supervision and refinement modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semantic scene completion (SSC) models by refining coarse predictions and improving mean IoU for complex datasets.

Method: ESSC-RM includes a two-phase process: a coarse voxel prediction by a baseline SSC network, refined by a Prediction Noise-Aware Module (PNAM) and a Voxel-level Local Geometry Module (VLGM) using multiscale supervision.

Result: Integrating ESSC-RM into CGFormer and MonoScene improves mean IoU from 16.87% to 17.27% and from 11.08% to 11.51%, respectively, verified on SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: ESSC-RM is an effective and versatile plug-and-play refinement framework for improving existing SSC models' semantic prediction performance.

Abstract: We propose ESSC-RM, a plug-and-play Enhancing framework for Semantic Scene Completion with a Refinement Module, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing SSC models. ESSC-RM operates in two phases: a baseline SSC network first produces a coarse voxel prediction, which is subsequently refined by a 3D U-Net-based Prediction Noise-Aware Module (PNAM) and Voxel-level Local Geometry Module (VLGM) under multiscale supervision. Experiments on SemanticKITTI show that ESSC-RM consistently improves semantic prediction performance. When integrated into CGFormer and MonoScene, the mean IoU increases from 16.87% to 17.27% and from 11.08% to 11.51%, respectively. These results demonstrate that ESSC-RM serves as a general refinement framework applicable to a wide range of SSC models.

*Badr Moufad,Navid Bagheri Shouraki,Alain Oliviero Durmus,Thomas Hirtz,Eric Moulines,Jimmy Olsson,Yazid Janati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient method to improve zero-shot diffusion-based image editing, eliminating backpropagation overhead for better quality and reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving zero-shot image editing methods that use diffusion models, specifically addressing the computational inefficiency caused by reliance on complex surrogate likelihood functions.

Method: Proposes a new likelihood surrogate to simplify Gaussian posterior transitions, avoiding backpropagation through the denoiser and reducing memory and runtime costs.

Result: The proposed method shows strong observation consistency, achieves high-quality image reconstructions, and significantly reduces inference costs compared to fine-tuned baselines.

Conclusion: The new approach enhances efficiency and quality in zero-shot diffusion-based image editing while being highly cost-effective, and it provides open-source code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for image editing tasks such as inpainting and local modification, where the objective is to generate realistic content that remains consistent with observed regions. In particular, zero-shot approaches that leverage a pretrained diffusion model, without any retraining, have been shown to achieve highly effective reconstructions. However, state-of-the-art zero-shot methods typically rely on a sequence of surrogate likelihood functions, whose scores are used as proxies for the ideal score. This procedure however requires vector-Jacobian products through the denoiser at every reverse step, introducing significant memory and runtime overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new likelihood surrogate that yields simple and efficient to sample Gaussian posterior transitions, sidestepping the backpropagation through the denoiser network. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves strong observation consistency compared with fine-tuned baselines and produces coherent, high-quality reconstructions, all while significantly reducing inference cost.

*Wenhao Hu,Haonan Zhou,Zesheng Li,Liu Liu,Jiacheng Dong,Zhizhong Su,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecurGS is introduced as a framework to incrementally and interactively adapt 3D Gaussian scene representations for efficient manipulation and reconstruction, addressing existing challenges in novel-state synthesis and long-term updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in adapting 3D representations to discrete scene changes and challenges in constructing interactive 3D environments, which current methods fail to handle effectively.

Method: RecurGS employs recurrent fusion, semantic correspondence with Lie-algebra refinement, and voxelized visibility-aware updates. It integrates discrete scene states while preserving historical structures using replay supervision.

Result: The framework delivers high-quality reconstructions, supports object manipulation and generates novel scene states efficiently without additional scans. It reduces the issue of catastrophic forgetting and ensures photorealistic fidelity.

Conclusion: RecurGS provides a scalable and efficient approach to interactive 3D scene modeling, making significant strides toward enabling continuously evolving Gaussian worlds in vision and robotics.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene representations have enabled high-fidelity novel view synthesis, yet adapting to discrete scene changes and constructing interactive 3D environments remain open challenges in vision and robotics. Existing approaches focus solely on updating a single scene without supporting novel-state synthesis. Others rely on diffusion-based object-background decoupling that works on one state at a time and cannot fuse information across multiple observations. To address these limitations, we introduce RecurGS, a recurrent fusion framework that incrementally integrates discrete Gaussian scene states into a single evolving representation capable of interaction. RecurGS detects object-level changes across consecutive states, aligns their geometric motion using semantic correspondence and Lie-algebra based SE(3) refinement, and performs recurrent updates that preserve historical structures through replay supervision. A voxelized, visibility-aware fusion module selectively incorporates newly observed regions while keeping stable areas fixed, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enabling efficient long-horizon updates. RecurGS supports object-level manipulation, synthesizes novel scene states without requiring additional scans, and maintains photorealistic fidelity across evolving environments. Extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework delivers high-quality reconstructions with substantially improved update efficiency, providing a scalable step toward continuously interactive Gaussian worlds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses digitizing mosaic artworks using a fine-tuned segmentation model, achieving improved accuracy over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving fragile and ancient mosaics digitally is essential due to their cultural importance and vulnerability to damage.

Method: The authors leverage the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), fine-tune it with a newly annotated mosaic dataset, and evaluate its performance on segmentation tasks.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves an Intersection over Union of 91.02%, Recall of 95.89%, a 3% higher F-measure, and drastically reduces tesserae prediction error compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates improved segmentation of mosaic tesserae, showcasing the potential for real-time applications and advancing digital preservation efforts.

Abstract: Art is widely recognized as a reflection of civilization and mosaics represent an important part of cultural heritage. Mosaics are an ancient art form created by arranging small pieces, called tesserae, on a surface using adhesive. Due to their age and fragility, they are prone to damage, highlighting the need for digital preservation. This paper addresses the problem of digitizing mosaics by segmenting the tesserae to separate them from the background within the broader field of Image Segmentation in Computer Vision. We propose a method leveraging Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) by Meta AI, a foundation model that outperforms most conventional segmentation models, to automatically segment mosaics. Due to the limited open datasets in the field, we also create an annotated dataset of mosaic images to fine-tune and evaluate the model. Quantitative evaluation on our testing dataset shows notable improvements compared to the baseline SAM 2 model, with Intersection over Union increasing from 89.00% to 91.02% and Recall from 92.12% to 95.89%. Additionally, on a benchmark proposed by a prior approach, our model achieves an F-measure 3% higher than previous methods and reduces the error in the absolute difference between predicted and actual tesserae from 0.20 to just 0.02. The notable performance of the fine-tuned SAM 2 model together with the newly annotated dataset can pave the way for real-time segmentation of mosaic images.

*Dimitrios Georgoulopoulos,Nikolaos Chaidos,Angeliki Dimitriou,Giorgos Stamou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISm introduces a framework for retrieving semantically similar images by focusing on important objects and their relationships, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image retrieval methods struggle to account for relational and contextual nuances, limiting their semantic accuracy.

Method: PRISm uses an Importance Prediction Module to retain key objects and relationships, and an Edge-Aware Graph Neural Network to encode semantic and visual information.

Result: Experiments show superior performance on benchmarks, and the method captures key semantic details in interpretable ways.

Conclusion: PRISm offers a more semantically informed image retrieval system by integrating relational reasoning and visual features, aligning with human perception.

Abstract: Accurately retrieving images that are semantically similar remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, as traditional methods often fail to capture the relational and contextual nuances of a scene. We introduce PRISm (Pruning-based Image Retrieval via Importance Prediction on Semantic Graphs), a multimodal framework that advances image-to-image retrieval through two novel components. First, the Importance Prediction Module identifies and retains the most critical objects and relational triplets within an image while pruning irrelevant elements. Second, the Edge-Aware Graph Neural Network explicitly encodes relational structure and integrates global visual features to produce semantically informed image embeddings. PRISm achieves image retrieval that closely aligns with human perception by explicitly modeling the semantic importance of objects and their interactions, capabilities largely absent in prior approaches. Its architecture effectively combines relational reasoning with visual representation, enabling semantically grounded retrieval. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate consistently superior top-ranked performance, while qualitative analyses show that PRISm accurately captures key objects and interactions, producing interpretable and semantically meaningful results.

*Fei Song,Yi Li,Jiangmeng Li,Rui Wang,Changwen Zheng,Fanjiang Xu,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AmPLe (Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning), addressing prompt biases across vision-language models to improve task performance under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face challenges adapting to downstream tasks due to model-prompt and sample-prompt matching biases.

Method: An ensemble learning approach aggregates diverse predictions and calculates adaptive weights using prompt-relevant semantics guided by information theory analysis.

Result: AmPLe demonstrates superior performance across tasks like novel class generalization, new dataset adaptation, and unseen domain shifts.

Conclusion: AmPLe effectively tackles prompt-matching biases, validated by experimental and causal theoretical analyses, marking advancements in multi-prompt learning.

Abstract: Multi-prompt learning methods have emerged as an effective approach for facilitating the rapid adaptation of vision-language models to downstream tasks with limited resources. Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three representative tasks, i.e., generalization to novel classes, new target datasets, and unseen domain shifts, show that AmPLe can widely outperform existing methods. Theoretical validation from a causal perspective further supports the effectiveness of AmPLe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras are efficient and high-performance but struggle with capturing static or slow-moving objects and lack color information essential for various applications. Addressing these gaps motivated the development of this integrated solution.

Method: The authors propose combining a monocular monochrome event-based camera with Active Structured Light (ASL) via a DLP projector to detect both color and depth. Dynamic projection adjustments are used to acquire selective color data while maintaining high spatial resolution.

Result: The system achieves a color detection speed of 1400 fps and pixel depth detection of 4 kHz, facilitating the generation of colorful point clouds and enhancing RGB-D sensing performance.

Conclusion: The integration of event-based cameras with a DLP projector provides a high-speed, frameless RGB-D sensing solution that could significant impact applications in robotics, 3D reconstruction, and other computer vision fields.

Abstract: Event-based cameras (ECs) have emerged as bio-inspired sensors that report pixel brightness changes asynchronously, offering unmatched speed and efficiency in vision sensing. Despite their high dynamic range, temporal resolution, low power consumption, and computational simplicity, traditional monochrome ECs face limitations in detecting static or slowly moving objects and lack color information essential for certain applications. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach that integrates a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector, forming Active Structured Light (ASL) for RGB-D sensing. By combining the benefits of ECs and projection-based techniques, our method enables the detection of color and the depth of each pixel separately. Dynamic projection adjustments optimize bandwidth, ensuring selective color data acquisition and yielding colorful point clouds without sacrificing spatial resolution. This integration, facilitated by a commercial TI LightCrafter 4500 projector and a monocular monochrome EC, not only enables frameless RGB-D sensing applications but also achieves remarkable performance milestones. With our approach, we achieved a color detection speed equivalent to 1400 fps and 4 kHz of pixel depth detection, significantly advancing the realm of computer vision across diverse fields from robotics to 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MeniMV, a unique multi-view dataset for precise, horn-specific meniscus tear grading using MRI, addressing gaps in localization and severity in automated analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited progress in precise grading of meniscal horn tears using automated MRI methods, especially the lack of fine-grained, localized, and multi-view diagnostic datasets, inspired this work.

Method: The study developed the MeniMV dataset containing 3,000 knee MRI exams (6,000 images total). It includes annotations for four-tier severity (grades 0-3) verified by orthopedic experts. Multiple state-of-the-art models were benchmarked to validate the dataset.

Result: MeniMV was validated as a benchmark dataset for meniscal tear severity grading, proving its value through experiments with CNN and Transformer-based models, which highlighted existing challenges.

Conclusion: MeniMV significantly expands the dataset base for multi-view meniscus injury analysis, providing essential tools for advancing automated musculoskeletal imaging research.

Abstract: Precise grading of meniscal horn tears is critical in knee injury diagnosis but remains underexplored in automated MRI analysis. Existing methods often rely on coarse study-level labels or binary classification, lacking localization and severity information. In this paper, we introduce MeniMV, a multi-view benchmark dataset specifically designed for horn-specific meniscus injury grading. MeniMV comprises 3,000 annotated knee MRI exams from 750 patients across three medical centers, providing 6,000 co-registered sagittal and coronal images. Each exam is meticulously annotated with four-tier (grade 0-3) severity labels for both anterior and posterior meniscal horns, verified by chief orthopedic physicians. Notably, MeniMV offers more than double the pathology-labeled data volume of prior datasets while uniquely capturing the dual-view diagnostic context essential in clinical practice. To demonstrate the utility of MeniMV, we benchmark multiple state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer-based models. Our extensive experiments establish strong baselines and highlight challenges in severity grading, providing a valuable foundation for future research in automated musculoskeletal imaging.

*Zongyao Li,Yongkang Wong,Satoshi Yamazaki,Jianquan Liu,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an object-centric framework for video moment retrieval to address current limitations in capturing detailed object-level semantics and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video moment retrieval often overlook fine-grained object semantics and appearance, limiting their effectiveness for object-oriented queries with specific entities and interactions.

Method: The proposed framework uses scene graph parsers to extract query-relevant objects. Scene graphs from video frames represent these objects and their relationships, and a relational tracklet transformer processes the object-level feature sequences to model spatio-temporal correlations.

Result: The framework was evaluated on three benchmarks (Charades-STA, QVHighlights, TACoS) and achieved state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating object-level semantics and temporal dynamics offers significant improvement to video moment retrieval, addressing critical limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: Most existing video moment retrieval methods rely on temporal sequences of frame- or clip-level features that primarily encode global visual and semantic information. However, such representations often fail to capture fine-grained object semantics and appearance, which are crucial for localizing moments described by object-oriented queries involving specific entities and their interactions. In particular, temporal dynamics at the object level have been largely overlooked, limiting the effectiveness of existing approaches in scenarios requiring detailed object-level reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric framework for moment retrieval. Our method first extracts query-relevant objects using a scene graph parser and then generates scene graphs from video frames to represent these objects and their relationships. Based on the scene graphs, we construct object-level feature sequences that encode rich visual and semantic information. These sequences are processed by a relational tracklet transformer, which models spatio-temporal correlations among objects over time. By explicitly capturing object-level state changes, our framework enables more accurate localization of moments aligned with object-oriented queries. We evaluated our method on three benchmarks: Charades-STA, QVHighlights, and TACoS. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain gaps in medical imaging hinder machine learning; this paper introduces 'Plasticine,' the first end-to-end image-to-image translation framework ensuring traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges caused by domain gaps in medical imaging systems, which can impact learning performance and interpretation in clinical scenarios. Ensuring pixel-level traceability has been overlooked in current methods.

Method: They propose the 'Plasticine' framework, employing a denoising diffusion method to enable both intensity translation and spatial transformations for traceable image-to-image conversions.

Result: Their approach generates synthetic medical images with interpretable intensity changes and spatially coherent shifts, maintaining pixel-level traceability during translation.

Conclusion: Plasticine fills an important gap in medical imaging by providing the first framework designed to ensure traceability, enhancing interpretability for clinical applications.

Abstract: Domain gaps arising from variations in imaging devices and population distributions pose significant challenges for machine learning in medical image analysis. Existing image-to-image translation methods primarily aim to learn mappings between domains, often generating diverse synthetic data with variations in anatomical scale and shape, but they usually overlook spatial correspondence during the translation process. For clinical applications, traceability, defined as the ability to provide pixel-level correspondences between original and translated images, is equally important. This property enhances clinical interpretability but has been largely overlooked in previous approaches. To address this gap, we propose Plasticine, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end image-to-image translation framework explicitly designed with traceability as a core objective. Our method combines intensity translation and spatial transformation within a denoising diffusion framework. This design enables the generation of synthetic images with interpretable intensity transitions and spatially coherent deformations, supporting pixel-wise traceability throughout the translation process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLMs suffer from high computational and memory costs due to the use of high-dimensional visual features. Current fixed-rate visual compression limits adaptability to different visual complexities, prompting the need for a dynamic solution.

Method: Adaptive-VoCo extends VoCo-LLaMA by incorporating a lightweight predictor to determine optimal compression rates using statistical cues like patch token entropy and attention map variance. A joint loss function is introduced to balance efficiency and representational capacity.

Result: The proposed Adaptive-VoCo framework outperformed fixed-rate compression methods consistently across various multimodal tasks, improving both efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: Adaptive visual compression, as implemented in Adaptive-VoCo, enhances vision-language models by dynamically balancing computational efficiency and representational accuracy, paving the way for more efficient and robust applications of VLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. However, handling high-dimensional visual features often incurs substantial computational and memory costs. VoCo-LLaMA alleviates this issue by compressing visual patch tokens into a few VoCo tokens, reducing computational overhead while preserving strong cross-modal alignment. Nevertheless, such approaches typically adopt a fixed compression rate, limiting their ability to adapt to varying levels of visual complexity. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive-VoCo, a framework that augments VoCo-LLaMA with a lightweight predictor for adaptive compression. This predictor dynamically selects an optimal compression rate by quantifying an image's visual complexity using statistical cues from the vision encoder, such as patch token entropy and attention map variance. Furthermore, we introduce a joint loss function that integrates rate regularization with complexity alignment. This enables the model to balance inference efficiency with representational capacity, particularly in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms fixed-rate baselines across multiple multimodal tasks, highlighting the potential of adaptive visual compression for creating more efficient and robust VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in ship type classification using SAR imagery, which is hindered by the high diversity of ship types and the need for large, high-quality annotated datasets.

Method: The authors developed the NASTaR dataset, containing 3415 ship patches extracted from NovaSAR S-band imagery, labeled with AIS data. It includes 23 ship types, inshore/offshore separation, and a wake dataset.

Result: Using benchmark deep learning models, the dataset achieves over 60% accuracy for four major ship types, above 70% for three-class scenarios, over 75% for cargo vs tanker differentiation, and more than 87% for fishing vessel identification.

Conclusion: The NASTaR dataset proves effective for ship type classification and offers a valuable resource for improving deep learning models in this domain.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers a unique capability for all-weather, space-based maritime activity monitoring by capturing and imaging strong reflections from ships at sea. A well-defined challenge in this domain is ship type classification. Due to the high diversity and complexity of ship types, accurate recognition is difficult and typically requires specialized deep learning models. These models, however, depend on large, high-quality ground-truth datasets to achieve robust performance and generalization. Furthermore, the growing variety of SAR satellites operating at different frequencies and spatial resolutions has amplified the need for more annotated datasets to enhance model accuracy. To address this, we present the NovaSAR Automated Ship Target Recognition (NASTaR) dataset. This dataset comprises of 3415 ship patches extracted from NovaSAR S-band imagery, with labels matched to AIS data. It includes distinctive features such as 23 unique classes, inshore/offshore separation, and an auxiliary wake dataset for patches where ship wakes are visible. We validated the dataset applicability across prominent ship-type classification scenarios using benchmark deep learning models. Results demonstrate over 60% accuracy for classifying four major ship types, over 70% for a three-class scenario, more than 75% for distinguishing cargo from tanker ships, and over 87% for identifying fishing vessels.

*Jensen Zhang,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models struggle with out-of-distribution concepts due to modal asymmetry, and Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) addresses this by creating pseudo-word embeddings for better cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the issue of vision-language models failing in open-world scenarios, specifically their inability to handle out-of-distribution concepts caused by modal asymmetry.

Method: The authors propose Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA), which constructs dynamic pseudo-word embeddings driven by adaptive gradient-based representation optimization and semantic regularization during inference.

Result: GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot out-of-distribution accuracy by up to 15-20% on benchmarks like ImageNet-R and VISTA-Beyond, while retaining in-distribution performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that pseudo-word optimization and dynamic representation techniques are critical for enhancing vision-language models, especially in handling out-of-distribution instances.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle in open-world applications, where out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts often trigger cross-modal alignment collapse and severely degrade zero-shot performance. We identify the root cause as modal asymmetry: while the visual encoder can extract discriminative features from unseen images, the text encoder is constrained by a fixed discrete vocabulary and cannot synthesize new semantic anchors. Existing approaches such as CoOp or LoRA provide only partial remedies, as they remain confined to the pre-trained semantic space.
  To overcome this bottleneck, we propose dynamic representation optimization, realized through the Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) framework. At inference time, GTMA constructs a continuous pseudo-word embedding that best aligns with an OOD image's visual anchor, effectively bypassing vocabulary limitations. The optimization is driven by an adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization algorithm, which incorporates semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with the model's prior knowledge.
  Experiments on ImageNet-R and the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot OOD accuracy by up to 15-20 percent over the base VLM while maintaining performance on in-distribution concepts. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of pseudo-word optimization.

### [178] [Detection of AI Generated Images Using Combined Uncertainty Measures and Particle Swarm Optimised Rejection Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18527)
*Rahul Yumlembam,Biju Issac,Nauman Aslam,Eaby Kollonoor Babu,Josh Collyer,Fraser Kennedy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining multiple uncertainty measures to detect AI-generated images and adaptively reject misclassifications, demonstrating robustness against distribution shifts and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distinguish increasingly photorealistic AI-generated images from natural images, aiming to address growing challenges in reliable detection.

Method: Utilize uncertainty measures like Fisher Information, entropy from Monte Carlo Dropout, and Deep Kernel Learning with Gaussian Processes, optimized via Particle Swarm Optimization to combine signals and set rejection thresholds.

Result: Framework achieves robust rejection rates under distribution shifts (~70% on new generators) and rejects adversarial attacks effectively (~61-80%).

Conclusion: Combining diverse uncertainty measures provides reliable detection of AI-generated images, even under challenging conditions like distribution shifts and adversarial attacks.

Abstract: As AI-generated images become increasingly photorealistic, distinguishing them from natural images poses a growing challenge. This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks using FGSM and PGD, the Combined Uncertainty method rejects around 61 percent of successful attacks, while GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80 percent. Overall, the results demonstrate that multi-source uncertainty fusion provides a resilient and adaptive solution for AI-generated image detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wound assessment is currently subjective, leading to inconsistencies in classification and delayed interventions, posing significant clinical and economic challenges.

Abstract: Chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers which affect up to one-third of people with diabetes, impose a substantial clinical and economic burden, with U.S. healthcare costs exceeding 25 billion dollars annually. Current wound assessment remains predominantly subjective, leading to inconsistent classification and delayed interventions. We present WoundNet-Ensemble, an Internet of Medical Things system leveraging a novel ensemble of three complementary deep learning architectures: ResNet-50, the self-supervised Vision Transformer DINOv2, and Swin Transformer, for automated classification of six clinically distinct wound types. Our system achieves 99.90 percent ensemble accuracy on a comprehensive dataset of 5,175 wound images spanning diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, thermal burns, pilonidal sinus wounds, and fungating malignant tumors. The weighted fusion strategy demonstrates a 3.7 percent improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we implement a longitudinal wound healing tracker that computes healing rates, severity scores, and generates clinical alerts. This work demonstrates a robust, accurate, and clinically deployable tool for modernizing wound care through artificial intelligence, addressing critical needs in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring.

*Kai Kohyama,Yoshimitsu Aoki,Guillermo Gallego,Shintaro Shiba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that improves event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting by separating geometry rendering and radiance rendering, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring pretrained models or initializations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution but require advanced methods to fully utilize sparse event data for motion and structure estimation in 3D reconstruction.

Method: The authors decouple rendering into event-by-event geometry rendering (depth) and snapshot-based radiance rendering (intensity) using ray-tracing and warped event images.

Result: Their approach achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets, competitive results on synthetic datasets, sharp edge reconstructions, flexibility in event selection, and fast training without prior models or COLMAP initialization.

Conclusion: The method improves understanding of sparse event data for 3D reconstruction and offers an efficient, flexible solution with the promise of code release.

Abstract: Event cameras offer a high temporal resolution over traditional frame-based cameras, which makes them suitable for motion and structure estimation. However, it has been unclear how event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches could leverage fine-grained temporal information of sparse events. This work proposes a framework to address the trade-off between accuracy and temporal resolution in event-based 3DGS. Our key idea is to decouple the rendering into two branches: event-by-event geometry (depth) rendering and snapshot-based radiance (intensity) rendering, by using ray-tracing and the image of warped events. The extensive evaluation shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world datasets and competitive performance on the synthetic dataset. Also, the proposed method works without prior information (e.g., pretrained image reconstruction models) or COLMAP-based initialization, is more flexible in the event selection number, and achieves sharp reconstruction on scene edges with fast training time. We hope that this work deepens our understanding of the sparse nature of events for 3D reconstruction. The code will be released.

### [181] [Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Multisource Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18553)
*Alexander M. Glandon,Khan M. Iftekharuddin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian framework for multisource domain adaptation, optimizing pretraining by leveraging source domain similarities and showing significant accuracy improvements in tasks like human action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing ad-hoc approaches to multisource domain adaptation, which rely on weight sharing or independently trained models, by considering the similarity between source domain distributions.

Method: A hierarchical Bayesian framework is proposed for multisource domain adaptation, leveraging the similarities among source domain distributions to optimize the pretraining process.

Result: The proposed framework achieves significant accuracy improvements, such as a 17.29% increase in human action recognition accuracy on a multi-domain benchmark dataset, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This Bayesian framework effectively enhances accuracy in multisource domain adaptation by utilizing similarities across source domains, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multisource domain adaptation (MDA) aims to use multiple source datasets with available labels to infer labels on a target dataset without available labels for target supervision. Prior works on MDA in the literature is ad-hoc as the pretraining of source models is either based on weight sharing or uses independently trained models. This work proposes a Bayesian framework for pretraining in MDA by considering that the distributions of different source domains are typically similar. The Hierarchical Bayesian Framework uses similarity between the different source data distributions to optimize the pretraining for MDA. Experiments using the proposed Bayesian framework for MDA show that our framework improves accuracy on recognition tasks for a large benchmark dataset. Performance comparison with state-of-the-art MDA methods on the challenging problem of human action recognition in multi-domain benchmark Daily-DA RGB video shows the proposed Bayesian Framework offers a 17.29% improvement in accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object identification and grounding in Vision-Language-Action models, especially in complex or out-of-distribution environments.

Method: Point-VLA enhances language instructions with explicit visual cues (like bounding boxes) and automates dataset expansion for more effective training.

Result: Point-VLA exhibits superior performance on real-world tasks, particularly in cluttered or challenging scenarios, and generalizes well to unseen objects.

Conclusion: By integrating visual cues and automated data annotation, Point-VLA achieves precise object grounding and improves embodied control performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models align vision and language with embodied control, but their object referring ability remains limited when relying solely on text prompt, especially in cluttered or out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes. In this study, we introduce the Point-VLA, a plug-and-play policy that augments language instructions with explicit visual cues (e.g., bounding boxes) to resolve referential ambiguity and enable precise object-level grounding. To efficiently scale visually grounded datasets, we further develop an automatic data annotation pipeline requiring minimal human effort. We evaluate Point-VLA on diverse real-world referring tasks and observe consistently stronger performance than text-only instruction VLAs, particularly in cluttered or unseen-object scenarios, with robust generalization. These results demonstrate that Point-VLA effectively resolves object referring ambiguity through pixel-level visual grounding, achieving more generalizable embodied control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEDALIGN enhances Med-LVLMs by addressing misaligned visual understanding using alignment distillation from a domain-specific CLIP model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-LVLMs often generate hallucinated outputs due to insufficient visual representation learning and poor visual attention alignment.

Method: MEDALIGN uses alignment distillation with two losses: spatial-aware visual alignment loss and attention-aware distillation loss to improve visual grounding.

Result: Experiments on medical report generation and VQA benchmarks show significant improvement in performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: MEDALIGN effectively addresses visual misalignment in Med-LVLMs, producing clinically relevant and visually grounded outputs.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promising results in clinical applications, but often suffer from hallucinated outputs due to misaligned visual understanding. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations contributing to this issue: insufficient visual representation learning and poor visual attention alignment. To address these problems, we propose MEDALIGN, a simple, lightweight alignment distillation framework that transfers visual alignment knowledge from a domain-specific Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to Med-LVLMs. MEDALIGN introduces two distillation losses: a spatial-aware visual alignment loss based on visual token-level similarity structures, and an attention-aware distillation loss that guides attention toward diagnostically relevant regions. Extensive experiments on medical report generation and medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks show that MEDALIGN consistently improves both performance and interpretability, yielding more visually grounded outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with reasoning about out-of-view content within natural images, a critical step toward more comprehensive visual understanding.

Method: Three contributions are introduced: 1) the OpenView pipeline for VQA using panoramic imagery, 2) OpenView-Dataset, a synthetic dataset for fine-tuning, and 3) OpenView-Bench to evaluate both choice and rationale accuracy.

Result: Models empowered by OpenView improved their out-of-view VQA accuracy, increasing from 48.6% to 64.1% on average, though there is still a gap to human performance.

Conclusion: OpenView successfully boosts multimodal models' OOV reasoning capability and provides tools for ongoing evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show great potential in natural image understanding. Yet, they perform well, mainly on reasoning in-view contents within the image frame. This paper presents the first study on out-of-view (OOV) understanding, i.e., the ability to reason objects, activities, and scenes beyond the visible frame of a perspective view. Our technical contributions are threefold. First, we design OpenView, a four-stage pipeline to massively generate multi-choice VQA by leveraging panoramic imagery to enable context-rich and spatial-grounded VQA synthesis with free-view framing. Second, we curate OpenView-Dataset, a high-quality synthetic dataset from diverse real-world panoramas to empower MLLMs upon supervised fine-tuning. Third, we build OpenView-Bench, a benchmark that jointly measures choice and rationale accuracy for interpretable and diagnosable evaluation. Experimental results show that despite having a large gap from human performance in OOV VQA answer selection, upon empowered by OpenView, multiple MLLMs can consistently boost their performance, uplifted from 48.6% to 64.1% on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN benchmarks are limited by small-scale datasets, oversimplified simulations, fragmented tasks, and insufficient compatibility with modern language model pretraining. These gaps hinder advancements in sim-to-real generalization and embodied AI research.

Method: VLNVerse is designed as a scalable, extensible framework with realistic simulations using a physics engine, unifying fragmented tasks into one platform. It supports kinematic agents and provides tools for evaluating classic and multi-modal large language models (MLLM).

Result: Researchers utilized VLNVerse to evaluate classic and MLLM-based models, demonstrating its utility for unified task performance analysis and sim-to-real navigation. They also proposed a new multi-task model addressing tasks within the benchmark.

Conclusion: VLNVerse advances research in Vision-Language Navigation, bridging simulation and real-world application gaps, while fostering development of scalable, versatile embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN), existing benchmarks remain confined to fixed, small-scale datasets with naive physical simulation. These shortcomings limit the insight that the benchmarks provide into sim-to-real generalization, and create a significant research gap. Furthermore, task fragmentation prevents unified/shared progress in the area, while limited data scales fail to meet the demands of modern LLM-based pretraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VLNVerse: a new large-scale, extensible benchmark designed for Versatile, Embodied, Realistic Simulation, and Evaluation. VLNVerse redefines VLN as a scalable, full-stack embodied AI problem. Its Versatile nature unifies previously fragmented tasks into a single framework and provides an extensible toolkit for researchers. Its Embodied design moves beyond intangible and teleporting "ghost" agents that support full-kinematics in a Realistic Simulation powered by a robust physics engine. We leverage the scale and diversity of VLNVerse to conduct a comprehensive Evaluation of existing methods, from classic models to MLLM-based agents. We also propose a novel unified multi-task model capable of addressing all tasks within the benchmark. VLNVerse aims to narrow the gap between simulated navigation and real-world generalization, providing the community with a vital tool to boost research towards scalable, general-purpose embodied locomotion agents.

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective in addressing low-speed false activations in AEB systems, with reliable detection, reduced false braking, and real-time processing capability, improving safety performance.

Abstract: A vision-based trajectory analysis solution is proposed to address the "zero-speed braking" issue caused by inaccurate Controller Area Network (CAN) signals in commercial vehicle Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems during low-speed operation. The algorithm utilizes the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform to process sequential video frames from a blind spot camera, employing self-adaptive Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)-enhanced Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) matching. This allows for precise classification of the vehicle's motion state (static, vibration, moving). Key innovations include 1) multiframe trajectory displacement statistics (5-frame sliding window), 2) a dual-threshold state decision matrix, and 3) OBD-II driven dynamic Region of Interest (ROI) configuration. The system effectively suppresses environmental interference and false detection of dynamic objects, directly addressing the challenge of low-speed false activation in commercial vehicle safety systems. Evaluation in a real-world dataset (32,454 video segments from 1,852 vehicles) demonstrates an F1-score of 99.96% for static detection, 97.78% for moving state recognition, and a processing delay of 14.2 milliseconds (resolution 704x576). The deployment on-site shows an 89% reduction in false braking events, a 100% success rate in emergency braking, and a fault rate below 5%.

Motivation: Current LLM systems face inefficiencies due to recomputation overhead when switching between task-specific adapters during inference.

Method: The authors propose aLoRA, a system employing techniques like base-aligned block hashing and activation-aware masking to support cross-model prefix cache reuse, designed to integrate with existing serving frameworks.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates up to 58x reductions in latency and over 100x improvement in time-to-first-token performance compared to traditional baselines.

Conclusion: This work achieves efficient parameter adaptation with fast and effective inference processes, enabling innovative LLM serving strategies with cross-model KV-cache reuse.

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) systems increasingly rely on multi-turn pipelines that are composed of multiple task-specific adapters, yet existing serving frameworks remain inefficient, incurring substantial recomputation overhead when switching between adapters. We present the first LLM serving engine that supports cross-model prefix cache reuse between base and adapted models via Activated LoRA (aLoRA), enabling efficient and fine-grained adapter switching during inference. Our design extends the vLLM framework by introducing base-aligned block hashing and activation-aware masking within the model execution path, permitting cache reuse across models while preserving compatibility with existing serving engine optimizations. Integrated into a production-grade inference stack, this approach supports dynamic adapter activation without excessive key-value tensor recomputation. Evaluation across representative multi-turn, multi-adapter pipelines demonstrates up to 58x end-to-end latency reduction and over 100x time-to-first-token improvement relative to standard LoRA baselines, with benefits that scale with model size and sequence length and manifest across all stages of the request lifecycle. This work bridges parameter-efficient model adaptation with high-performance serving, providing the first complete realization of cross-model KV-cache reuse in modern LLM inference engines.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers new ways to explore the theory of computation via the laws of quantum mechanics. Due to the rising demand for quantum computing resources, there is growing interest in developing cloud-based quantum resource sharing platforms that enable researchers to test and execute their algorithms on real quantum hardware. These cloud-based systems face a fundamental challenge in efficiently allocating quantum hardware resources to fulfill the growing computational demand of modern Internet of Things (IoT) applications. So far, attempts have been made in order to make efficient resource allocation, ranging from heuristic-based solutions to machine learning.

Method: The authors developed a general framework for digital twin learning optimized for reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs) to improve speed, energy efficiency, and resource usage. They compared its performance to mobile GPUs and cloud GPUs in various scenarios.

Result: The FPGA implementation showed an 8.8x higher performance-per-watt, 28.5x lower DRAM footprint, and 1.67x runtime speedup compared to cloud GPUs. Mobile GPUs had some performance and energy advantages but were less efficient in runtime and memory footprint.

Conclusion: FPGA-based digital twin learning is a significant advancement for precision healthcare, offering better efficiency for edge devices and enabling advanced applications like synthetic data generation and disease detection.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) can enable precision healthcare by continually learning a mathematical representation of patient-specific dynamics. However, mission critical healthcare applications require fast, resource-efficient DT learning, which is often infeasible with existing model recovery (MR) techniques due to their reliance on iterative solvers and high compute/memory demands. In this paper, we present a general DT learning framework that is amenable to acceleration on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs, enabling substantial speedup and energy efficiency. We compare our FPGA-based implementation with a multi-processing implementation in mobile GPU, which is a popular choice for AI in edge devices. Further, we compare both edge AI implementations with cloud GPU baseline. Specifically, our FPGA implementation achieves an 8.8x improvement in \text{performance-per-watt} for the MR task, a 28.5x reduction in DRAM footprint, and a 1.67x runtime speedup compared to cloud GPU baselines. On the other hand, mobile GPU achieves 2x better performance per watts but has 2x increase in runtime and 10x more DRAM footprint than FPGA. We show the usage of this technique in DT guided synthetic data generation for Type 1 Diabetes and proactive coronary artery disease detection.

In mission-critical applications, such as mid-air collision avoidance, these models must operate online with extremely low latency to ensure safety. However, executing complex Model Recovery (MR) pipelines on edge devices is limited by computational and memory bandwidth constraints. This paper introduces a fast, FPGA-accelerated digital twinning framework that offloads key neural components, including gated recurrent units (GRU) and dense layers, to reconfigurable hardware for efficient parallel execution. Our system achieves real-time responsiveness, operating five times faster than typical human reaction time, and demonstrates the practical viability of deploying digital twins on edge platforms for time-sensitive, safety-critical environments.

*Yi Yang,Ziyu Lin,Liesheng Wei*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ACE-Sync introduces an adaptive synchronization framework for distributed deep learning, reducing communication costs by 60% while maintaining high model accuracy with innovative techniques including gradient importance prediction and error compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed training of large-scale models faces communication inefficiencies, especially in constrained cloud-edge environments, with traditional methods often failing to balance cost, stability, and accuracy.

Method: ACE-Sync employs an attention-based gradient importance predictor, differentiated compression strategies, hierarchical synchronization, a knapsack optimization, residual-based error compensation, and device clustering for efficient cloud-edge training.

Result: ACE-Sync reduces communication from 112.5 GB to 44.7 GB (60% reduction), decreases convergence epochs from 41 to 39, and achieves 82.1% Top-1 accuracy, only 0.3% below full synchronization.

Conclusion: ACE-Sync is an effective and scalable solution for cloud-edge distributed training, significantly reducing communication overhead while ensuring competitive model accuracy and efficient convergence.

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models impose substantial communication overh ead in distributed training, particularly in bandwidth-constrained or heterogeneous clo ud-edge environments. Conventional synchronous or fixed-compression techniques o ften struggle to balance communication cost, convergence stability, and model accura cy. To address these challenges, we propose ACE-Sync, an Adaptive Cloud-Edge Sy nchronization Framework that integrates (1) an attention-based gradient importance p redictor, (2) a differentiated parameter compression strategy, and (3) a hierarchical cl oud-edge coordination mechanism. ACE-Sync dynamically selects which parameter groups to synchronize and determines appropriate compression levels under per-devic e bandwidth budgets. A knapsack-based optimization strategy is adopted to maximize important gradient preservation while reducing redundant communication. Furthermo re, residual-based error compensation and device clustering ensure long-term converg ence and cross-device personalization. Experiments show that ACE-Sync substantiall y reduces communication overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy. Compar ed with FullSync, ACE-Sync lowers communication cost from 112.5 GB to 44.7 GB (a 60% reduction) and shortens convergence from 41 to 39 epochs. Despite aggressiv e communication reduction, ACE-Sync preserves high model quality, achieving 82. 1% Top-1 accuracy-only 0.3% below the full-synchronization baseline-demonstrating its efficiency and scalability for large-scale distributed training. These results indicate that ACE-Sync provides a scalable, communication-efficient, and accuracy-preservin g solution for large-scale cloud-edge distributed model training.

*Dongha Yoon,Younghoon Min,Hoshik Kim,Sam H. Noh,Jongryool Kim*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TraCT is a rack-scale LLM serving system that replaces RDMA-based KV transfer with CXL shared memory, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fundamental bottleneck of KV tensor transfer in disaggregated LLM serving systems as model sizes and context lengths grow.

Method: Developing TraCT, which utilizes CXL shared memory for KV transfer and a rack-wide prefix-aware KV cache, along with software solutions like a two-tier inter-node synchronization mechanism.

Result: TraCT shows up to 9.8x average TTFT reduction, 6.2x P99 latency reduction, and 1.6x peak throughput improvement compared to RDMA and DRAM-based caching baselines.

Conclusion: TraCT successfully addresses synchronization, consistency, and data management challenges in non-coherent CXL memory to boost performance in LLM serving systems.

Abstract: Disaggregated LLM serving improves resource efficiency by separating the compute-intensive prefill phase from the latency-critical decode phase. However, this architecture introduces a fundamental bottleneck: key/value (KV) tensors generated during prefill must be transferred to decode workers, and existing systems rely on RDMA-based network paths for this exchange. As model sizes and context lengths increase, KV transfer dominates both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and peak throughput, and remains highly sensitive to network contention even when prefix reuse is high. This paper presents TraCT, a rack-scale LLM serving system that uses CXL shared memory as both a KV-transfer substrate and a rack-wide prefix-aware KV cache. TraCT enables GPUs to write and read KV blocks directly through CXL load/store and DMA operations, eliminating the NIC hop that constrains existing disaggregated pipelines. However, to realize this design, multiple new challenges such as synchronization, consistency, and data management on non-coherent CXL memory need to be addressed. TraCT proposes various software solutions such as the two-tier inter-node synchronization mechanism to address these challenges. We implement TraCT on the Dynamo LLM inference framework and show that, across static and synthetic workloads, TraCT reduces average TTFT by up to 9.8x, lowers P99 latency by up to 6.2x, and improves peak throughput by up to 1.6x compared to RDMA and DRAM-based caching baselines.

### [195] [Faster Vertex Cover Algorithms on GPUs with Component-Aware Parallel Branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18334)
*Hussein Amro,Basel Fakhri,Amer E. Mouawad,Izzat El Hajj*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel GPU solution for vertex cover problems that performs better than previous solutions in terms of scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GPU algorithms for vertex cover suffer from scalability issues due to component redundancy and high memory usage, especially for large and complex graphs.

Method: The authors design a GPU algorithm that detects graph splits into components, branches independently on these components, delegates non-tail-recursive branches for post-processing, and reduces memory usage through graph reduction.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving results in seconds compared to over 6 hours for prior GPU solutions.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates scalable and efficient GPU parallelization of non-tail-recursive branching for vertex cover problems, significantly advancing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Algorithms for finding minimum or bounded vertex covers in graphs use a branch-and-reduce strategy, which involves exploring a highly imbalanced search tree. Prior GPU solutions assign different thread blocks to different sub-trees, while using a shared worklist to balance the load. However, these prior solutions do not scale to large and complex graphs because their unawareness of when the graph splits into components causes them to solve these components redundantly. Moreover, their high memory footprint limits the number of workers that can execute concurrently. We propose a novel GPU solution for vertex cover problems that detects when a graph splits into components and branches on the components independently. Although the need to aggregate the solutions of different components introduces non-tail-recursive branches which interfere with load balancing, we overcome this challenge by delegating the post-processing to the last descendant of each branch. We also reduce the memory footprint by reducing the graph and inducing a subgraph before exploring the search tree. Our solution substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU solution, finishing in seconds when the state-of-the-art solution exceeds 6 hours. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to parallelize non-tail-recursive branching patterns on GPUs in a load balanced manner.

*Wentao Liu,Yuhao Hu,Ruiting Zhou,Baochun Li,Ne Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Remoe, a system for optimizing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model inference in serverless computing using targeted module assignments and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the high inference costs of MoE models and address challenges in serverless computing related to memory overhead and input-dependent expert activation.

Method: Remoe assigns modules to specialized processors (GPUs/CPUs) and serverless functions while implementing three optimization techniques: SPS, MMP algorithm, and a joint optimization framework using Lagrangian duality and LPT.

Result: Remoe decreased inference costs by 57% and reduced cold start latency by 47% in experimental benchmarks.

Conclusion: Remoe effectively tackles MoE inference challenges by leveraging serverless computing architecture and optimization techniques to enhance cost and performance efficiency.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture in large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to scale model capacity via sparse expert activation. Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Yihe Zhang,Yash Kurkure,Yiheng Tao,Michael E. Papka,Zhiling Lan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SchedTwin is a real-time digital twin for adaptive HPC scheduling, outperforming static policies by leveraging predictive simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPC workloads are becoming more diverse, requiring adaptive scheduling solutions as traditional heuristic-based static scheduling is insufficient for modern needs.

Method: SchedTwin uses runtime events from the scheduler and performs predictive simulations via discrete-event simulations to guide scheduling decisions dynamically, with a focus on administrator-defined goals.

Result: SchedTwin outperforms static scheduling policies in tests and incurs minimal overhead (a few seconds per scheduling cycle).

Conclusion: Real-time digital twins like SchedTwin provide a viable and effective approach to adaptive scheduling in HPC environments.

Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) workloads are becoming increasingly diverse, exhibiting wide variability in job characteristics, yet cluster scheduling has long relied on static, heuristic-based policies. In this work we present SchedTwin, a real-time digital twin designed to adaptively guide scheduling decisions using predictive simulation. SchedTwin periodically ingests runtime events from the physical scheduler, performs rapid what-if evaluations of multiple policies using a high-fidelity discrete-event simulator, and dynamically selects the one satisfying the administrator configured optimization goal. We implement SchedTwin as an open-source software and integrate it with the production PBS scheduler. Preliminary results show that SchedTwin consistently outperforms widely used static scheduling policies, while maintaining low overhead (a few seconds per scheduling cycle). These results demonstrate that real-time digital twins offer a practical and effective path toward adaptive HPC scheduling.

*Murtaza Rangwala,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Murmura, a decentralized federated learning framework that uses evidential deep learning to address personalization challenges in heterogeneous environments, ensuring trust-aware collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the statistical heterogeneity and personalization challenges in decentralized federated learning environments, overcoming limitations of global models and heuristic peer selection.

Method: Murmura employs evidential deep learning to derive epistemic uncertainty, which helps identify compatible peers. It uses a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that evaluates models against local validation samples, adjusting thresholds adaptively.

Result: Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions (0.9% vs. 19.3%), accelerates convergence by 7.4x, and maintains stable accuracy across various parameters, as validated on wearable IoT datasets.

Conclusion: Evidential uncertainty provides a robust method for identifying peer compatibility and ensuring effective model personalization, making Murmura a significant step forward for decentralized federated learning.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training across edge devices without centralized coordination, offering resilience against single points of failure. However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices. These results establish evidential uncertainty as a principled foundation for compatibility-aware personalization in decentralized heterogeneous environments.

*Yitao Yuan,Chenqi Zhao,Bohan Zhao,Zane Cao,Yongchao He,Wenfei Wu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents L4, a runtime system to optimize GPU utilization for large language model (LLM) services by addressing inefficiencies caused by batch request-length heterogeneity, improving latency and throughput significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art language models with extended context windows result in significant inefficiencies due to underutilized GPUs and increased latency from request-length heterogeneity within batches.

Method: L4 dynamically reschedules requests across multiple LLM instances using length-specialized groups, a dynamic programming algorithm for optimal stage partitioning, runtime range refinement, and decentralized load balancing.

Result: L4 demonstrated up to 67% reduction in end-to-end latency, 69% reduction in tail latency, and a 2.89x improvement in system throughput compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: L4 effectively mitigates inefficiencies in GPU utilization for LLM services, optimizing performance and throughput through dynamic and innovative scheduling mechanisms.

Abstract: Efficiently harnessing GPU compute is critical to improving user experience and reducing operational costs in large language model (LLM) services. However, current inference engine schedulers overlook the attention backend's sensitivity to request-length heterogeneity within a batch. As state-of-the-art models now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, this once-tolerable inefficiency has escalated into a primary system bottleneck, causing severe performance degradation through GPU underutilization and increased latency. We present L4, a runtime system that dynamically reschedules requests across multiple instances serving the same LLM to mitigate per-instance length heterogeneity. L4 partitions these instances into length-specialized groups, each handling requests within a designated length range, naturally forming a pipeline as requests flow through them. L4 devises a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently find the stage partition with the best QoE, employs runtime range refinement together with decentralized load (re)balance both across and within groups, achieving a balanced and efficient multi-instance service. Our evaluation shows that, under the same configuration, L4 reduces end-to-end latency by up to 67% and tail latency by up to 69%, while improving overall system throughput by up to 2.89 times compared to the state-of-the-art multi-instance scheduling systems.

*Philipp Schneider,Julian Werthmann*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the relationship between two computational models, strongly sublinear MPC and the Node-Capacitated Clique (NCC), with a focus on efficient round-preserving simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how and when round-preserving simulations can be achieved between strongly sublinear MPC and NCC models, especially in scenarios where memory and bandwidth are matched.

Method: The authors analyze the structural capabilities of both models, propose positive simulation techniques to enable constant-overhead transformations, and provide proof for situations where simulations are impossible.

Result: They establish simulation techniques that ensure constant overhead under specific conditions and present impossibility results to highlight the inherent limitations of simulations.

Conclusion: The study reveals both capabilities and limitations of simulations, providing insights into the compatibility of computational models for graph-centric problems in sublinear settings.

Abstract: We study how the strongly sublinear MPC model relates to the classic, graph-centric distributed models, focusing on the Node-Capacitated Clique (NCC), a bandwidth-parametrized generalization of the Congested Clique. In MPC, $M$ machines with per-machine memory $S$ hold a partition of the input graph, in NCC, each node knows its full neighborhood but can send/receive only a bounded number of $C$ words per round. We are particularly interested in the strongly sublinear regime where $S=C=n^δ$ for some constant $0 < δ<1$.
  Our goal is determine when round-preserving simulations between these models are possible and when they are not, when total memory and total bandwidth $SM=nC$ in both models are matched, for different problem families and graph classes. On the positive side, we provide techniques that allow us to replicate the specific behavior regarding input representation, number of machines and local memory from one model to the other to obtain simulations with only constant overhead. On the negative side, we prove simulation impossibility results, which show that the limitations of our simulations are necessary.

*Kiril Dichev,Filip Pawlowski,Albert-Jan Yzelman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation for deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) to address latency and throughput issues in unbalanced inference runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in distributed lookup operations during DLRM inference, particularly delays caused by irregular embedding table accesses and multi-node communication bottlenecks.

Method: The authors propose a bounded lag synchronous (BLS) strategy for alltoallv operations, implemented as a PyTorch Distributed backend, allowing slower processes to lag without blocking faster ones within set parameters.

Result: The BLS technique maintains accuracy for inference-only DLRMs and shows improved performance, particularly in unbalanced scenarios with delays or irregular embedding table access, by increasing latency and throughput.

Conclusion: BLS offers notable improvements in specific unbalanced scenarios, demonstrating its potential to optimize DLRM inference while maintaining accuracy, despite no significant benefits in well-balanced runs.

Abstract: Recommender systems are enablers of personalized content delivery, and therefore revenue, for many large companies. In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an ablation study exploring the cross-modal performance of memory mechanisms in spiking neural networks (SNNs) across both visual and auditory datasets, revealing significant modality-specific performance differences and proposing energy-efficient designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unexplored generalization of memory-augmented spiking neural networks across different sensory modalities in neuromorphic computing.

Method: Evaluated memory mechanisms (Hopfield networks, HGRNs, SCL) using visual (N-MNIST) and auditory (SHD) datasets, performing a cross-modal evaluation with both single and joint multi-modal architectures.

Result: Hopfield networks showed severe performance gaps across modalities, while SCL provided better cross-modal performance. Multi-modal HGRN achieved comparable accuracy and high energy efficiency, substantiated by engram analysis with weak modality alignment.

Conclusion: Memory mechanisms in SNNs exhibit task-specific benefits rather than universal applicability, emphasizing the need for modality-specific optimization to achieve balanced performance and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Memory-augmented spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, yet their generalization across sensory modalities remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive cross-modal ablation study of memory mechanisms in SNNs, evaluating Hopfield networks, Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Networks (HGRNs), and supervised contrastive learning (SCL) across visual (N-MNIST) and auditory (SHD) neuromorphic datasets. Our systematic evaluation of five architectures reveals striking modality-dependent performance patterns: Hopfield networks achieve 97.68% accuracy on visual tasks but only 76.15% on auditory tasks (21.53 point gap), revealing severe modality-specific specialization, while SCL demonstrates more balanced cross-modal performance (96.72% visual, 82.16% audio, 14.56 point gap). These findings establish that memory mechanisms exhibit task-specific benefits rather than universal applicability. Joint multi-modal training with HGRN achieves 94.41% visual and 79.37% audio accuracy (88.78% average), matching parallel HGRN performance through unified deployment. Quantitative engram analysis confirms weak cross-modal alignment (0.038 similarity), validating our parallel architecture design. Our work provides the first empirical evidence for modality-specific memory optimization in neuromorphic systems, achieving 603x energy efficiency over traditional neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study employs machine learning models to better predict lung cancer mortality rates, with random forest yielding the highest performance and offering insights into impactful variables and geographic disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the prediction of lung cancer mortality rates, which is critical for creating targeted interventions and addressing health inequities that exacerbate health disparities in the United States.

Method: Machine learning models—random forest, gradient boosting regression, and linear regression—were applied to predict county-level lung cancer mortality rates. Their performance was assessed using R-squared and RMSE. SHAP analysis was performed for variable importance, and geographic disparities were examined using Getis-Ord hotspot analysis.

Result: The random forest model demonstrated the best predictive performance (R2: 41.9%; RMSE: 12.8). Smoking rates, median home value, and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population were key predictors. Geographic analysis identified elevated lung cancer mortality clusters in mid-eastern counties of the U.S.

Conclusion: Random forest models offer precise mortality predictions and highlight factors guiding targeted interventions, such as smoking prevalence and geographic clusters, to mitigate lung cancer mortality disparities effectively.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population. Spatial analysis revealed significant clusters of elevated LC mortality in the mid-eastern counties of the United States. The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance for LC mortality rates, emphasizing the critical roles of smoking prevalence, housing values, and the percentage of Hispanic ethnic population. These findings offer valuable actionable insights for designing targeted interventions, promoting screening, and addressing health disparities in regions most affected by LC in the United States.

*Petr Koklev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks monotone-constrained versus unconstrained gradient boosting models for credit default prediction and quantifies the performance impact, termed Price of Monotonicity (PoM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing predictive accuracy and interpretability in machine learning models used in credit risk is challenging. The study aims to evaluate the trade-off imposed by monotonicity constraints.

Method: Five public datasets and three libraries are used to compare monotone-constrained models with unconstrained ones using paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty, defining the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) as the performance impact of constraints.

Result: PoM varies, with AUC losses ranging from essentially zero to 2.9 percent. Constraints are minimally costly in large datasets (less than 0.2 percent, often negligible) but more pronounced in smaller datasets (around 2-3 percent).

Conclusion: Monotonicity constraints can substantially increase interpretability with manageable accuracy losses, especially effective on large datasets in credit portfolios.

Abstract: Financial institutions face a trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability when deploying machine learning models for credit risk. Monotonicity constraints align model behavior with domain knowledge, but their performance cost - the price of monotonicity - is not well quantified. This paper benchmarks monotone-constrained versus unconstrained gradient boosting models for credit probability of default across five public datasets and three libraries. We define the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) as the relative change in standard performance metrics when moving from unconstrained to constrained models, estimated via paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty. In our experiments, PoM in AUC ranges from essentially zero to about 2.9 percent: constraints are almost costless on large datasets (typically less than 0.2 percent, often indistinguishable from zero) and most costly on smaller datasets with extensive constraint coverage (around 2-3 percent). Thus, appropriately specified monotonicity constraints can often deliver interpretability with small accuracy losses, particularly in large-scale credit portfolios.

Conclusion: Small language models, with scalable and verified correctness, can effectively optimize compilers and handle complex parallelization tasks in heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: Traditional auto-parallelizing compilers, reliant on rigid heuristics, struggle with the complexity of modern heterogeneous systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of small (approximately 1B parameter) language-model-driven compiler auto-parallelization. We evaluate three models: gemma3, llama3.2, and qwen2.5, using six reasoning strategies across 11 real-world kernels drawn from scientific computing, graph algorithms, and machine learning. Our system is benchmarked against strong compiler baselines, including LLVM Polly, TVM, and Triton. Across 376 total evaluations, the proposed approach achieves an average speedup of 6.81x and a peak performance of 43.25x on convolution operations. We analyze scalability, verify correctness using multiple sanitizers, and confirm robustness across diverse compilers and hardware platforms. Our results demonstrate that small, efficient language models can serve as powerful reasoning engines for complex compiler optimization tasks.

*Peng Fan,Guofei Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends the convolutional neural operator (CNO) model to few-shot learning, demonstrating enhanced surrogate accuracy for solving PDEs using neuron linear transformation over other strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable few-shot learning capabilities for convolutional neural operators, which were previously not validated for scenarios involving very small target datasets.

Method: They pre-train CNO using a source dataset and adjust its parameters for small target datasets through strategies such as fine-tuning, low-rank adaptation, and neuron linear transformation.

Result: Neuron linear transformation was found to yield the highest surrogate accuracy for solving PDEs like Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Brusselator system, and Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that extending convolutional neural operators with neuron linear transformation improves their applicability to few-shot learning for solving complex PDEs.

Abstract: Convolutional neural operator is a CNN-based architecture recently proposed to enforce structure-preserving continuous-discrete equivalence and enable the genuine, alias-free learning of solution operators of PDEs. This neural operator was demonstrated to outperform for certain cases some baseline models such as DeepONet, Fourier neural operator, and Galerkin transformer in terms of surrogate accuracy. The convolutional neural operator, however, seems not to be validated for few-shot learning. We extend the model to few-shot learning scenarios by first pre-training a convolutional neural operator using a source dataset and then adjusting the parameters of the trained neural operator using only a small target dataset. We investigate three strategies for adjusting the parameters of a trained neural operator, including fine-tuning, low-rank adaption, and neuron linear transformation, and find that the neuron linear transformation strategy enjoys the highest surrogate accuracy in solving PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Brusselator diffusion-reaction system, and Navier-Stokes equations.

*Gunho Park,Jeongin Bae,Byeongwook Kim,Baeseong park,Jiwon Ryu,Hoseung Kim,Se Jung Kwon,Dongsoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeGEMM, a kernel designed to speed up weight-only quantization for LLM inference by precomputing partial sums and eliminating dequantization overheads, resulting in substantial performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address latency and cache pressure caused by dequantization in current methods for weight-only quantization in large language model (LLM) inference, especially in extremely low-bit scenarios like 2-bit configurations.

Method: Proposes CodeGEMM, a new GEMM kernel that uses precomputed inner products (Psumbook) to replace the traditional dequantization process, streamlining inference by directly using code indices to gather partial sums.

Result: CodeGEMM achieved significant speedups of 1.83x and 8.93x in 8B and 70B Llama-3 models respectively for 2-bit configurations, while maintaining accuracy and improving computing efficiency and memory utilization.

Conclusion: CodeGEMM efficiently balances latency, memory usage, and accuracy, outperforming existing codebook-based quantization techniques in speed and resource utilization during LLM inference.

Abstract: Weight-only quantization is widely used to mitigate the memory-bound nature of LLM inference. Codebook-based methods extend this trend by achieving strong accuracy in the extremely low-bit regime (e.g., 2-bit). However, current kernels rely on dequantization, which repeatedly fetches centroids and reconstructs weights, incurring substantial latency and cache pressure. We present CodeGEMM, a codebook-centric GEMM kernel that replaces dequantization with precomputed inner products between centroids and activations stored in a lightweight Psumbook. At inference, code indices directly gather these partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing the on-chip footprint. The kernel supports the systematic exploration of latency-memory-accuracy trade-offs under a unified implementation. On Llama-3 models, CodeGEMM delivers 1.83x (8B) and 8.93x (70B) speedups in the 2-bit configuration compared to state-of-the-art codebook-based quantization at comparable accuracy and further improves computing efficiency and memory subsystem utilization.

*Irina Seregina,Philippe Lalanda,German Vega*

TL;DR: The study explores parameter-efficient techniques, LoRA and QLoRA, for adapting HAR models efficiently, yielding comparable performance to full fine-tuning but with reduced resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting large pretrained models for HAR tasks in resource-constrained domains by exploring scalable fine-tuning techniques.

Method: Implemented an adaptation framework using a Masked Autoencoder and compared LoRA and QLoRA against full fine-tuning under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out protocol.

Result: LoRA and QLoRA performed comparably to full fine-tuning in recognition tasks while significantly reducing trainable parameters, training time, and memory usage.

Conclusion: LoRA provides a controllable balance between accuracy and efficiency, and QLoRA further reduces memory requirements with minimal effect on classification quality, offering practical scalability.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition is a foundational task in pervasive computing. While recent advances in self-supervised learning and transformer-based architectures have significantly improved HAR performance, adapting large pretrained models to new domains remains a practical challenge due to limited computational resources on target devices. This papers investigates parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA, as scalable alternatives to full model fine-tuning for HAR. We propose an adaptation framework built upon a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluate its performance under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time. Further analyses reveal that LoRA maintains robust performance even under limited supervision and that the adapter rank provides a controllable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. QLoRA extends these benefits by reducing the memory footprint of frozen weights through quantization, with minimal impact on classification quality.

*Mohammadmahdi Rahimiasl,Ynte Vanderhoydonc,Siegfried Mercelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents HINT, a machine learning method to improve traffic flow estimation at unsensed locations using inductive and transductive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic flow prediction is challenging due to sparse precise data from loop detectors, weak correlation of speed data with flow, and heterogeneity among nearby traffic links.

Method: Proposes HINT, combining an inductive spatial transformer for long-range interactions, a diffusion GCN using contextual data, and a calibration layer to fix biases. It uses innovative training strategies including masked reconstruction and hard-node mining.

Result: HINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in improving flow estimation across three datasets, reducing errors significantly (e.g., up to 50% in some cases). Simulation data improves performance markedly in certain cases.

Conclusion: HINT demonstrates that integrating inductive flow learning with transductive speed signals, simulation, and static geospatial attributes enhances accuracy in traffic flow predictions.

Abstract: Accurately imputing traffic flow at unsensed locations is difficult: loop detectors provide precise but sparse measurements, speed from probe vehicles is widely available yet only weakly correlated with flow, and nearby links often exhibit strong heterophily in the scale of traffic flow (e.g., ramps vs. mainline), which breaks standard GNN assumptions. We propose HINT, a Hybrid INductive-Transductive Network, and an INDU-TRANSDUCTIVE training strategy that treats speed as a transductive, network-wide signal while learning flow inductively to generalize to unseen locations. HINT couples (i) an inductive spatial transformer that learns similarity-driven, long-range interactions from node features with (ii) a diffusion GCN conditioned by FiLM on rich static context (OSM-derived attributes and traffic simulation), and (iii) a node-wise calibration layer that corrects scale biases per segment. Training uses masked reconstruction with epoch-wise node sampling, hard-node mining to emphasize difficult sensors, and noise injection on visible flows to prevent identity mapping, while graph structure is built from driving distances.
  Across three real-world datasets, MOW (Antwerp, Belgium), UTD19-Torino, and UTD19-Essen, HINT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inductive baselines. Relative to KITS, HINT reduces MAE on MOW by $\approx42$% with basic simulation and $\approx50$% with calibrated simulation; on Torino by $\approx22$%, and on Essen by $\approx12$%. Even without simulation, HINT remains superior on MOW and Torino, while simulation is crucial on Essen. These results show that combining inductive flow imputation with transductive speed, traffic simulations and external geospatial improves accuracy for the task described above.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoE-TransMov, a Transformer-based model combined with a Mixture-of-Experts architecture designed to predict the next POI with high accuracy by distinguishing between familiar and unfamiliar mobility contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of personalized POI prediction, particularly in differentiating user mobility patterns between familiar and unfamiliar regions, which existing models fail to handle effectively.

Method: The proposed MoE-TransMov employs a Transformer model integrated with a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, utilizing self-attention mechanisms and adaptive gating networks to dynamically select expert models based on mobility contexts.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets (Foursquare NYC and Kyoto datasets) demonstrate that MoE-TransMov significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).

Conclusion: By efficiently capturing distinct mobility patterns in various contexts, MoE-TransMov enhances next POI prediction, improves personalization in recommendation systems, and supports urban applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the next point of interest (POI) within human mobility trajectories is essential for location-based services, as it enables more timely and personalized recommendations. In particular, with the rise of these approaches, studies have shown that users exhibit different POI choices in their familiar and unfamiliar areas, highlighting the importance of incorporating user familiarity into predictive models. However, existing methods often fail to distinguish between the movements of users in familiar and unfamiliar regions. To address this, we propose MoE-TransMov, a Transformer-based model with a Transformer model with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to use one framework to capture distinct mobility patterns across different moving contexts without requiring separate training for certain data. Using user-check-in data, we classify movements into familiar and unfamiliar categories and develop a specialized expert network to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach integrates self-attention mechanisms and adaptive gating networks to dynamically select the most relevant expert models for different mobility contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets, including the widely used but small open-source Foursquare NYC dataset and the large-scale Kyoto dataset collected with LY Corporation (Yahoo Japan Corporation), show that MoE-TransMov outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with notable improvements in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Given the results, we find that by using this approach, we can efficiently improve mobility predictions under different moving contexts, thereby enhancing the personalization of recommendation systems and advancing various urban applications.

*Maxmillan Ries,Sohan Seth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TraCeR, a transformer-based model for survival analysis, effectively incorporating longitudinal covariates and addressing calibration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in incorporating longitudinal covariates in survival analysis and evaluate model calibration, which have been understudied in prior models.

Method: The authors developed TraCeR, utilizing a factorized self-attention transformer-based architecture to model hazards using longitudinal covariates without rigid assumptions.

Result: TraCeR outperformed state-of-the-art methods in multiple datasets and improved on addressing both discrimination and calibration for survival analysis.

Conclusion: TraCeR advances survival analysis by enabling effective modeling of longitudinal covariates and contributing to better evaluation paradigms, including calibration.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a critical tool for modeling time-to-event data. Recent deep learning-based models have reduced various modeling assumptions including proportional hazard and linearity. However, a persistent challenge remains in incorporating longitudinal covariates, with prior work largely focusing on cross-sectional features, and in assessing calibration of these models, with research primarily focusing on discrimination during evaluation. We introduce TraCeR, a transformer-based survival analysis framework for incorporating longitudinal covariates. Based on a factorized self-attention architecture, TraCeR estimates the hazard function from a sequence of measurements, naturally capturing temporal covariate interactions without assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. The framework is inherently designed to handle censored data and competing events. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that TraCeR achieves substantial and statistically significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our evaluation extends beyond discrimination metrics and assesses model calibration, addressing a key oversight in literature.

### [212] [The Geometry of Abstraction: Continual Learning via Recursive Quotienting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18471)
*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a geometric approach to overcome the flat manifold problem in continual learning through Recursive Metric Contraction, enabling better representation and reducing interference within fixed-dimensional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge of the flat manifold problem in continual learning systems, where strict dimensional constraints lead to catastrophic interference due to trajectory overlap.

Method: It proposes Recursive Metric Contraction as a solution, leveraging topological deformation to collapse local manifold diameters and embedding long trajectories into limited-volume spaces. Four theorems are used to substantiate the approach.

Result: The approach enables long trajectories to fit within bounded volumes, improves separability of temporal sequences without infinite-dimensional kernels, resolves catastrophic forgetting, and represents neural tokens as physically realizable formations.

Conclusion: Recursive Metric Contraction offers a geometric foundation for continual learning, allowing systems to manage growing data within fixed dimensions while avoiding overlap and interference issues.

Abstract: Continual learning systems operating in fixed-dimensional spaces face a fundamental geometric barrier: the flat manifold problem. When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories. Our analysis reveals that tokens in neural architectures are physically realizable as singularities or wormholes, regions of extreme positive curvature that bridge distant points in the temporal manifold.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedOAED, a new federated learning algorithm leveraging autoencoder denoisers to address client-drift and variance in heterogeneous data under partial client participation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strict data-sharing regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, limit the implementation of data-driven ML/DL applications, necessitating solutions like Federated Learning to work with decentralized data while addressing inherent challenges such as heterogeneity and client-drift.

Method: FedOAED integrates an on-device autoencoder denoiser to reduce client-drift and variance caused by heterogeneous data under conditions of limited client participation.

Result: Experiments conducted on multiple vision datasets in Non-IID settings demonstrate that FedOAED consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: FedOAED shows significant promise in improving federated learning performance by effectively addressing issues of heterogeneity, client-drift, and variance, enabling better alignment with privacy-preserving regulations.

Abstract: Over the last few decades, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) solutions have demonstrated their potential across many applications by leveraging large amounts of high-quality data. However, strict data-sharing regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) have prevented many data-driven applications from being realised. Federated Learning (FL), in which raw data never leaves local devices, has shown promise in overcoming these limitations. Although FL has grown rapidly in recent years, it still struggles with heterogeneity, which produces gradient noise, client-drift, and increased variance from partial client participation. In this paper, we propose FedOAED, a novel federated learning algorithm designed to mitigate client-drift arising from multiple local training updates and the variance induced by partial client participation. FedOAED incorporates an on-device autoencoder denoiser on the client side to mitigate client-drift and variance resulting from heterogeneous data under limited client availability. Experiments on multiple vision datasets under Non-IID settings demonstrate that FedOAED consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: DFORM tackles issues in dynamical system model evaluation, enabling trajectory alignment across nonlinear systems and identifying low-dimensional motifs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in analyzing dynamics of high-dimensional nonlinear systems like RNNs due to differing coordinate systems and difficulty in motif identification.

Method: Proposed DFORM, which learns nonlinear coordinate transformations to align trajectories and topologies, enabling motif detection on low-dimensional manifolds.

Result: Validated approach on canonical systems, RNNs, nonlinear systems; demonstrated motif detection such as invariant manifolds and limit sets; applied to fMRI-trained RNNs to find limit cycles.

Conclusion: DFORM successfully aligns dynamical systems for comparison, identifies mechanisms, and provides insights into high-dimensional models' critical dynamics.

Abstract: Dynamical systems models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly popular in theoretical neuroscience for hypothesis-generation and data analysis. Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis.

Motivation: Atrial fibrillation is a prevalent condition in ICU patients with harmful health outcomes, and developing robust AI-driven detection systems is necessary.

Method: The study compared feature-based, deep learning, and ECG foundation models using ICU and external datasets with various training setups, including transfer learning.

Result: ECG foundation models achieved the highest F1 score (0.89) for AF detection in ICU datasets, outperforming other approaches.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the effectiveness of ECG foundation models and provides resources for advancing AF detection research in ICU environments.

Abstract: Objective: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia experienced by intensive care unit (ICU) patients and can cause adverse health effects. In this study, we publish a labelled ICU dataset and benchmarks for AF detection. Methods: We compared machine learning models across three data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches: feature-based classifiers, deep learning (DL), and ECG foundation models (FMs). This comparison addresses a critical gap in the literature and aims to pinpoint which AI approach is best for accurate AF detection. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) from a Canadian ICU and the 2021 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge were used to conduct the experiments. Multiple training configurations were tested, ranging from zero-shot inference to transfer learning. Results: On average and across both datasets, ECG FMs performed best, followed by DL, then feature-based classifiers. The model that achieved the top F1 score on our ICU test set was ECG-FM through a transfer learning strategy (F1=0.89). Conclusion: This study demonstrates promising potential for using AI to build an automatic patient monitoring system. Significance: By publishing our labelled ICU dataset (LinkToBeAdded) and performance benchmarks, this work enables the research community to continue advancing the state-of-the-art in AF detection in the ICU.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes and advances optimization algorithms for neural network training, moving from traditional methods like SGD to sophisticated second-order techniques, identifying their significance and practical implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations and empirical nature of current neural network optimization practices, such as SGD, by linking improvements in training algorithms to enhanced learning efficiency, reduced training time, and improved interpretability.

Method: The author examines the evolution of optimization algorithms and highlights the limitations of SGD and adaptive methods on anisotropic data, motivating the use of curvature-based methods, adaptive learning rates, and practical implementation strategies.

Result: The findings outline the interplay of optimization techniques with tools like learning rate schedules and exponential moving averages, which are critical for achieving empirical success in neural network training.

Conclusion: Principled and carefully designed optimization strategies that utilize modern techniques and curvature information can significantly improve neural network training and bridge the gap between theoretical and practical success.

Abstract: Neural network optimization remains one of the most consequential yet poorly understood challenges in modern AI research, where improvements in training algorithms can lead to enhanced feature learning in foundation models, order-of-magnitude reductions in training time, and improved interpretability into how networks learn. While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants have become the de facto standard for training deep networks, their success in these over-parameterized regimes often appears more empirical than principled. This thesis investigates this apparent paradox by tracing the evolution of optimization algorithms from classical first-order methods to modern higher-order techniques, revealing how principled algorithmic design can demystify the training process. Starting from first principles with SGD and adaptive gradient methods, the analysis progressively uncovers the limitations of these conventional approaches when confronted with anisotropy that is representative of real-world data. These breakdowns motivate the exploration of sophisticated alternatives rooted in curvature information: second-order approximation techniques, layer-wise preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and more. Next, the interplay between these optimization algorithms and the broader neural network training toolkit, which includes prior and recent developments such as maximal update parametrization, learning rate schedules, and exponential moving averages, emerges as equally essential to empirical success. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical deployment, this paper offers practical prescriptions and implementation strategies for integrating these methods into modern deep learning workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting, a transformative AI technique aimed at data privacy and deletion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing artificial intelligence requires balancing between learning systems and ensuring privacy, particularly in sensitive domains and for compliance with regulations.

Method: A systematic benchmarking framework evaluates privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting using a variety of unlearning methods, attacks, data sets, and model architectures.

Result: The study identifies critical factors influencing privacy leakage and benchmarks the performance of unlearning-induced privacy attacks.

Conclusion: This work provides a standardized benchmark that practitioners can use to assess privacy vulnerabilities accurately and deploy unlearning applications effectively.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have primarily focused on the process of learning from data to acquire knowledgeable learning systems. As these systems are increasingly deployed in critical areas, ensuring their privacy and alignment with human values is paramount. Recently, selective forgetting (also known as machine unlearning) has shown promise for privacy and data removal tasks, and has emerged as a transformative paradigm shift in the field of AI. It refers to the ability of a model to selectively erase the influence of previously seen data, which is especially important for compliance with modern data protection regulations and for aligning models with human values. Despite its promise, selective forgetting raises significant privacy concerns, especially when the data involved come from sensitive domains. While new unlearning-induced privacy attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental settings, which can lead to overly optimistic and potentially unfair assessments that may disproportionately favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting. We extensively investigate privacy vulnerabilities of machine unlearning techniques and benchmark privacy leakage across a wide range of victim data, state-of-the-art unlearning privacy attacks, unlearning methods, and model architectures. We systematically evaluate and identify critical factors related to unlearning-induced privacy leakage. With our novel insights, we aim to provide a standardized tool for practitioners seeking to deploy customized unlearning applications with faithful privacy assessments.

TL;DR: This paper discusses when and whether to replace an incumbent model with a new one using an economic and statistical approach. It proposes algorithms for optimal decision-making and validates them using a credit-scoring dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face the challenge of deciding the right time to replace an existing model with a newer one that has access to better or additional features, especially considering cost, model performance, and data availability. This paper aims to create a systematic approach to address this problem.

Method: The authors developed a framework linking economic and statistical factors like learning curves, retraining costs, and data-acquisition costs. They characterized the optimal switching time in theoretical settings and proposed three algorithms: a one-shot baseline, a greedy sequential method, and a look-ahead sequential method. Real-world credit-scoring data was used for validation.

Result: Their framework demonstrated that switching times depend on costs and learning-curve dynamics. The look-ahead sequential method performed best, closely approximating an oracle with full foresight. Finite-sample guarantees and sublinear regret conditions were also established.

Conclusion: This study provides a rigorous framework and practical guidance for deciding economically optimal transitions between models when new data sources become available.

Abstract: We study the problem of deciding whether, and when an organization should replace a trained incumbent model with a challenger relying on newly available features. We develop a unified economic and statistical framework that links learning-curve dynamics, data-acquisition and retraining costs, and discounting of future gains. First, we characterize the optimal switching time in stylized settings and derive closed-form expressions that quantify how horizon length, learning-curve curvature, and cost differentials shape the optimal decision. Second, we propose three practical algorithms: a one-shot baseline, a greedy sequential method, and a look-ahead sequential method. Using a real-world credit-scoring dataset with gradually arriving alternative data, we show that (i) optimal switching times vary systematically with cost parameters and learning-curve behavior, and (ii) the look-ahead sequential method outperforms other methods and is able to approach in value an oracle with full foresight. Finally, we establish finite-sample guarantees, including conditions under which the sequential look-ahead method achieve sublinear regret relative to that oracle. Our results provide an operational blueprint for economically sound model transitions as new data sources become available.

*Daniel David*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a probabilistic framework to model users' behaviors as latent states, providing interpretable insights and uncertainty-aware representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for user behavior models that provide uncertainty quantification and interpretable latent representations beyond deterministic embeddings or black-box models.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic digital twin framework using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to infer latent stochastic states of users from behavioral data. They include a statistical interpretation pipeline to link latent dimensions to observable patterns.

Result: The framework reveals interpretable latent dimensions, indicating traits such as opinion strength and decisiveness. The user structure appears largely continuous rather than discrete, with meaningful patterns along a few dominant latent dimensions.

Conclusion: Probabilistic digital twins offer a scalable and interpretable alternative to deterministic user embeddings, allowing for uncertainty-aware analysis in user behavior modeling.

Abstract: Understanding user identity and behavior is central to applications such as personalization, recommendation, and decision support. Most existing approaches rely on deterministic embeddings or black-box predictive models, offering limited uncertainty quantification and little insight into what latent representations encode. We propose a probabilistic digital twin framework in which each user is modeled as a latent stochastic state that generates observed behavioral data. The digital twin is learned via amortized variational inference, enabling scalable posterior estimation while retaining a fully probabilistic interpretation. We instantiate this framework using a variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to a user-response dataset designed to capture stable aspects of user identity. Beyond standard reconstruction-based evaluation, we introduce a statistically grounded interpretation pipeline that links latent dimensions to observable behavioral patterns. By analyzing users at the extremes of each latent dimension and validating differences using nonparametric hypothesis tests and effect sizes, we demonstrate that specific dimensions correspond to interpretable traits such as opinion strength and decisiveness. Empirically, we find that user structure is predominantly continuous rather than discretely clustered, with weak but meaningful structure emerging along a small number of dominant latent axes. These results suggest that probabilistic digital twins can provide interpretable, uncertainty-aware representations that go beyond deterministic user embeddings.

TL;DR: This paper identifies the common structure in proofs of logarithmic regret for stochastic bandit algorithms, proposing a unified analysis framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify and simplify the proof techniques used in various stochastic bandit algorithms, and extend them to modern variants.

Method: The authors isolate key analytical components: a high-probability concentration condition and two deterministic lemmas for radius collapse and optimism-forced deviations.

Result: Unified and near-minimal proofs are provided for classical algorithms like UCB, UCB-V, etc., and extended to modern bandit variants.

Conclusion: The framework simplifies and generalizes the analysis of optimism-based stochastic bandit algorithms, showing its broad applicability.

Abstract: Several optimism-based stochastic bandit algorithms -- including UCB, UCB-V, linear UCB, and finite-arm GP-UCB -- achieve logarithmic regret using proofs that, despite superficial differences, follow essentially the same structure. This note isolates the minimal ingredients behind these analyses: a single high-probability concentration condition on the estimators, after which logarithmic regret follows from two short deterministic lemmas describing radius collapse and optimism-forced deviations. The framework yields unified, near-minimal proofs for these classical algorithms and extends naturally to many contemporary bandit variants.

Conclusion: VDMN establishes a robust foundation for uncertainty-aware materials digital twins, enabling efficient forward and inverse predictions.

Abstract: Aleatoric uncertainties - irremovable variability in microstructure morphology, constituent behavior, and processing conditions - pose a major challenge to developing uncertainty-robust digital twins. We introduce the Variational Deep Material Network (VDMN), a physics-informed surrogate model that enables efficient and probabilistic forward and inverse predictions of material behavior. The VDMN captures microstructure-induced variability by embedding variational distributions within its hierarchical, mechanistic architecture. Using an analytic propagation scheme based on Taylor-series expansion and automatic differentiation, the VDMN efficiently propagates uncertainty through the network during training and prediction. We demonstrate its capabilities in two digital-twin-driven applications: (1) as an uncertainty-aware materials digital twin, it predicts and experimentally validates the nonlinear mechanical variability in additively manufactured polymer composites; and (2) as an inverse calibration engine, it disentangles and quantitatively identifies overlapping sources of uncertainty in constituent properties. Together, these results establish the VDMN as a foundation for uncertainty-robust materials digital twins.

*Enric Boix-Adsera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) layers in transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and hypothesizes that they approximate sparse computations, resembling sparsely-activating Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the dense and computationally opaque MLP layers within LLMs by exploring their relationship to sparse computation.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical connection between MoE models and Sparse Autoencoders and validate their hypothesis through experiments with pretrained LLMs, focusing on activation distributions.

Result: The study reveals that MLP layers can approximate sparsely-activating MoE layers, highlighting the importance of structured activation distributions in neural networks.

Conclusion: This understanding provides insight into MLP layer functionality, explains the effectiveness of MoE architecture in transformers, and suggests more efficient designs using low-rank routing strategies.

Abstract: Despite being one of the earliest neural network layers, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is arguably one of the least understood parts of the transformer architecture due to its dense computation and lack of easy visualization. This paper seeks to understand the MLP layers in dense LLM models by hypothesizing that these layers secretly approximately perform a sparse computation -- namely, that they can be well approximated by sparsely-activating Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers.
  Our hypothesis is based on a novel theoretical connection between MoE models and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) structure in activation space. We empirically validate the hypothesis on pretrained LLMs, and demonstrate that the activation distribution matters -- these results do not hold for Gaussian data, but rather rely crucially on structure in the distribution of neural network activations.
  Our results shine light on a general principle at play in MLP layers inside LLMs, and give an explanation for the effectiveness of modern MoE-based transformers. Additionally, our experimental explorations suggest new directions for more efficient MoE architecture design based on low-rank routers.

### [223] [Learning Generalizable Neural Operators for Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18120)
*Adam J. Thorpe,Stepan Tretiakov,Dibakar Roy Sarkar,Krishna Kumar,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inverse problems in neural operators are tackled by introducing B2B${}^{-1}$, which decouples function representation and inverse map by learning basis functions for input and output spaces, leading to robust probabilistic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems are challenging due to violations of assumptions like continuity and stability, making current neural operators insufficient for such tasks.

Method: The paper proposes B2B${}^{-1}$ framework, which separates function representation from inverse mapping by learning neural basis functions and modeling in coefficient spaces.

Result: By applying B2B${}^{-1}$ on inverse PDE benchmarks, probabilistic models capture uncertainty effectively, are robust to noise, and maintain consistent performance across varying levels of ill-posedness.

Conclusion: This framework provides scalable surrogate models for inverse problems that generalize effectively across diverse settings, making it versatile and robust.

Abstract: Inverse problems challenge existing neural operator architectures because ill-posed inverse maps violate continuity, uniqueness, and stability assumptions. We introduce B2B${}^{-1}$, an inverse basis-to-basis neural operator framework that addresses this limitation. Our key innovation is to decouple function representation from the inverse map. We learn neural basis functions for the input and output spaces, then train inverse models that operate on the resulting coefficient space. This structure allows us to learn deterministic, invertible, and probabilistic models within a single framework, and to choose models based on the degree of ill-posedness. We evaluate our approach on six inverse PDE benchmarks, including two novel datasets, and compare against existing invertible neural operator baselines. We learn probabilistic models that capture uncertainty and input variability, and remain robust to measurement noise due to implicit denoising in the coefficient calculation. Our results show consistent re-simulation performance across varying levels of ill-posedness. By separating representation from inversion, our framework enables scalable surrogate models for inverse problems that generalize across instances, domains, and degrees of ill-posedness.

### [224] [From Shortcut to Induction Head: How Data Diversity Shapes Algorithm Selection in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18634)
*Ryotaro Kawata,Yujin Song,Alberto Bietti,Naoki Nishikawa,Taiji Suzuki,Samuel Vaiter,Denny Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how pretraining data distributions influence shallow transformers to either generalize using algorithms or memorize via positional shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how different data distributions during pretraining guide transformers toward either generalizing or overfitting to shortcuts.

Method: The study examines a simplified prediction task and uses rigorous gradient-based training analysis of a single-layer transformer with both theoretical and experimental validations.

Result: The research finds that diverse input sequences foster induction heads and generalization, while less diverse sequences lead to positional shortcuts and poor OOD generalization. Optimal pretraining distributions are also derived.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into the algorithmic biases of transformers and suggests that controlling pretraining data diversity helps steer their learning behaviors and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Transformers can implement both generalizable algorithms (e.g., induction heads) and simple positional shortcuts (e.g., memorizing fixed output positions). In this work, we study how the choice of pretraining data distribution steers a shallow transformer toward one behavior or the other. Focusing on a minimal trigger-output prediction task -- copying the token immediately following a special trigger upon its second occurrence -- we present a rigorous analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer. In both the infinite and finite sample regimes, we prove a transition in the learned mechanism: if input sequences exhibit sufficient diversity, measured by a low ``max-sum'' ratio of trigger-to-trigger distances, the trained model implements an induction head and generalizes to unseen contexts; by contrast, when this ratio is large, the model resorts to a positional shortcut and fails to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD). We also reveal a trade-off between the pretraining context length and OOD generalization, and derive the optimal pretraining distribution that minimizes computational cost per sample. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating that broadening context distributions robustly induces induction heads and enables OOD generalization. Our results shed light on the algorithmic biases of pretrained transformers and offer conceptual guidelines for data-driven control of their learned behaviors.

### [225] [Grad: Guided Relation Diffusion Generation for Graph Augmentation in Graph Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18133)
*Jie Yang,Rui Zhang,Ziyang Cheng,Dawei Cheng,Guang Yang,Bo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses adaptive camouflage strategies in financial Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) by introducing a model, Grad, which improves detection efficiency through relation diffusion and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of online payment fraud in financial scenarios where fraudsters adaptively camouflage their behavior to mimic benign users, rendering current detection models less effective.

Method: The proposed Grad model employs supervised graph contrastive learning to enhance differentiation between fraudulent and benign users, and a guided relation diffusion generator to create auxiliary homophilic relations, amplifying weak fraudulent signals during data aggregation.

Result: The model achieved significant improvements in fraud detection compared to state-of-the-art approaches, showcasing up to 11.10% and 43.95% increases in AUC and AP respectively, verified through experiments on both WeChat Pay's datasets and public datasets.

Conclusion: Grad enhances the detection of fraudulent activities by addressing adaptive camouflage, providing a robust model for financial fraud prevention with proven effectiveness on large-scale real-world datasets.

Abstract: Nowadays, Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) in financial scenarios has become an urgent research topic to protect online payment security. However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets. The results show that our proposed model Grad outperforms SOTA methods in both various scenarios, achieving at most 11.10% and 43.95% increases in AUC and AP, respectively. Our code is released at https://github.com/AI4Risk/antifraud and https://github.com/Muyiiiii/WWW25-Grad.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses data portability and user autonomy in LLMs using chain-of-thought reasoning traces, arguing these traces qualify as personal data and proposing a method for communities to collaboratively build models better aligned with their goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address concerns about data privacy and user choice in the context of AI models like LLMs, and to provide pathways for communities to have greater autonomy in aligning models with their specific needs.

Method: The authors interpret privacy laws to classify intermediate chain-of-thought computations as personal data and build on the Conscious Data Contribution framework to enable communities to aggregate and distill knowledge into alternate models.

Result: They empirically validate the proposed approach, analyzing factors such as community diversity, reasoning granularity, and community size on the performance of the collaboratively built models.

Conclusion: Communities can achieve improved control and alignment of AI models by collectively contributing data and knowledge into new models, with potential impacts on privacy laws and AI personalization.

Abstract: The current era of AI development places a heavy emphasis on training large models on increasingly scaled-up datasets. This paradigm has catalyzed entirely new product categories, such as LLM chatbots, while also raising concerns about data privacy and consumer choice. In this paper, we consider questions of data portability and user autonomy in the context of LLMs that "reason" using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, computing intermediate text artifacts from user input before producing a final output. We first interpret recent data privacy and portability law to argue that these intermediate computations qualify as users' personal data. Then, building on the existing framework of Conscious Data Contribution, we show how communities who receive low utility from an available model can aggregate and distill their shared knowledge into an alternate model better aligned with their goals. We verify this approach empirically and investigate the effects of community diversity, reasoning granularity, and community size on distillation performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a convex loss function using Choquet integrals for supervised learning, optimizing trade-offs in uncertainty-aware set predictions and improving coverage and size efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve supervised learning by providing better uncertainty estimates using set predictions, addressing the trade-off between coverage and set size.

Method: The method involves formulating a convex loss function based on Choquet integrals, optimizing subset-valued functions for uncertainty-aware predictions, and designing efficient training algorithms.

Result: The approach achieves improved conditional probabilistic coverage and set size balance in experiments on synthetic datasets, surpassing marginal coverage-based methods.

Conclusion: This method advances uncertainty estimation in supervised learning, offering an efficient and effective way to optimize prediction sets for both coverage and size.

Abstract: We consider supervised learning problems in which set predictions provide explicit uncertainty estimates. Using Choquet integrals (a.k.a. Lov{á}sz extensions), we propose a convex loss function for nondecreasing subset-valued functions obtained as level sets of a real-valued function. This loss function allows optimal trade-offs between conditional probabilistic coverage and the ''size'' of the set, measured by a non-decreasing submodular function. We also propose several extensions that mimic loss functions and criteria for binary classification with asymmetric losses, and show how to naturally obtain sets with optimized conditional coverage. We derive efficient optimization algorithms, either based on stochastic gradient descent or reweighted least-squares formulations, and illustrate our findings with a series of experiments on synthetic datasets for classification and regression tasks, showing improvements over approaches that aim for marginal coverage.

*Rebecca Salganik,Yibin Wang,Guillaume Salha-Galvan,Jian Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairExpand, a framework to enhance individual fairness in graph representation learning when only partial node similarity information is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for individual fairness on graphs rely on predefined similarity data, which is often unavailable or unrealistic in practical scenarios.

Method: FairExpand alternates between refining node representations with a backbone model (e.g., graph neural networks) and propagating partial similarity data across the graph for fairness enhancement.

Result: FairExpand consistently improves individual fairness across the graph while maintaining model performance, as shown in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FairExpand is a practical tool for enforcing individual fairness in graph-based applications with limited similarity data, making it useful in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Individual fairness, which requires that similar individuals should be treated similarly by algorithmic systems, has become a central principle in fair machine learning. Individual fairness has garnered traction in graph representation learning due to its practical importance in high-stakes Web areas such as user modeling, recommender systems, and search. However, existing methods assume the existence of predefined similarity information over all node pairs, an often unrealistic requirement that prevents their operationalization in practice. In this paper, we assume the similarity information is only available for a limited subset of node pairs and introduce FairExpand, a flexible framework that promotes individual fairness in this more realistic partial information scenario. FairExpand follows a two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model (e.g., a graph neural network) and gradually propagating similarity information, which allows fairness enforcement to effectively expand to the entire graph. Extensive experiments show that FairExpand consistently enhances individual fairness while preserving performance, making it a practical solution for enabling graph-based individual fairness in real-world applications with partial similarity information.

*Alek Frohlich,Vladimir Kostic,Karim Lounici,Daniel Perazzo,Massimiliano Pontil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable and statistically grounded Conditional Independence (CI) testing method combining kernel-based theory with modern representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CI tests are limited by restrictive structural assumptions, slow convergence, poor scalability, and lack of adaptivity, making them less effective for real-world applications.

Method: The authors focus on singular value decomposition (SVD) derived representations of the partial covariance operator. They develop a simple test statistic inspired by HSIC, alongside a bi-level contrastive algorithm for representation learning.

Result: The proposed method establishes theoretical guarantees for validity and statistical power. Preliminary experiments indicate promising scalability and practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: Representation learning can improve CI testing methods by addressing scalability and adaptivity limitations, providing a robust integration of kernel-based theory with modern techniques.

Abstract: Conditional independence (CI) is central to causal inference, feature selection, and graphical modeling, yet it is untestable in many settings without additional assumptions. Existing CI tests often rely on restrictive structural conditions, limiting their validity on real-world data. Kernel methods using the partial covariance operator offer a more principled approach but suffer from limited adaptivity, slow convergence, and poor scalability. In this work, we explore whether representation learning can help address these limitations. Specifically, we focus on representations derived from the singular value decomposition of the partial covariance operator and use them to construct a simple test statistic, reminiscent of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We also introduce a practical bi-level contrastive algorithm to learn these representations. Our theory links representation learning error to test performance and establishes asymptotic validity and power guarantees. Preliminary experiments suggest that this approach offers a practical and statistically grounded path toward scalable CI testing, bridging kernel-based theory with modern representation learning.

### [230] [When Does Learning Renormalize? Sufficient Conditions for Power Law Spectral Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18209)
*Yizhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Generalized Resolution-Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework to model deep learning processes and identifies conditions enabling power-law scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the empirical power-law scaling observed in deep learning systems and its theoretical basis.

Method: Developing the GRSD framework and identifying structural conditions like bounded gradient propagation, log-shift invariance, and controlled Jacobian evolution.

Result: Sufficient conditions for renormalizable shell dynamics are identified, and power-law scaling is shown to result from combining specific invariance properties and gradient flow behavior.

Conclusion: Power-law scaling in deep learning arises from structural constraints and intrinsic properties of the learning dynamics modeled by the GRSD framework.

Abstract: Empirical power--law scaling has been widely observed across modern deep learning systems, yet its theoretical origins and scope of validity remain incompletely understood. The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.
  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MSSR, a novel method for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) that addresses stability and efficiency issues in multimodal large language models, achieving substantial improvements in training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods for multimodal reasoning, such as GRPO, face challenges in efficiency and stability, particularly under single-rollout settings, leading to training instability and collapse.

Method: Introduces MSSR, a new RLVR framework that achieves stable optimization and effective reasoning through an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism, which adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes.

Result: MSSR enhances training efficiency, achieving comparable accuracy to group-based methods with half the training steps, and surpasses them when trained for equal durations. It also demonstrates better generalization across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: MSSR is a stable, compute-efficient, and effective framework for RLVR, enabling robust multimodal reasoning and addressing the stability-efficiency trade-off in single-rollout training scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a key paradigm to improve the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevalent group-based algorithms such as GRPO require multi-rollout sampling for each prompt. While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies data saturation issues in policy training with behavioral cloning and proposes a novel data selection method, SDR, to improve training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address computational inefficiency and data saturation problems in offline policy learning using large-scale behavioral datasets.

Method: The proposed method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), prioritizes early-stage data (stepwise clip) and selects samples based on high action-value rank and low state-density rank.

Result: Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks show that SDR significantly improves policy training by selecting more informative and compact data subsets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of effective data selection in enhancing offline behavioral policy learning, offering a computationally efficient approach with SDR.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning is a widely adopted approach for offline policy learning from expert demonstrations. However, the large scale of offline behavioral datasets often results in computationally intensive training when used in downstream tasks. In this paper, we uncover the striking data saturation in offline behavioral data: policy performance rapidly saturates when trained on a small fraction of the dataset. We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets. SDR is build on two key principles: (1) stepwise clip, which prioritizes early-stage data; and (2) dual ranking, which selects samples with both high action-value rank and low state-density rank. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that SDR significantly enhances data selection for offline behavioral data.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the FAIR-k algorithm that optimizes the communication-efficiency and training convergence in federated learning systems with over-the-air computation, balancing parameter update freshness and importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical OAC systems and the high dimensionality of deep learning models used in federated learning.

Method: Proposes the FAIR-k algorithm, which selects impactful subsets of gradients for over-the-air updates, combining Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms with Markov analysis to balance timeliness and importance.

Result: The analysis shows FAIR-k accelerates convergence, enhances communication efficiency, and enables extended local training without compromising overall training efficiency.

Conclusion: FAIR-k improves efficiency and convergence in OAC-FL by promoting fresh, fair parameter updates, addressing limitations from data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness.

Abstract: Incorporating over-the-air computations (OAC) into the model training process of federated learning (FL) is an effective approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck in FL systems. Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency.

### [234] [On the Convergence Rate of LoRA Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18248)
*Siqiao Mu,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the LoRA algorithm, commonly leveraged for fine-tuning large models, demonstrating convergence at a rate of O(1/log T).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA has shown significant practical success in fine-tuning large models with lower computational costs. However, its theoretical convergence behavior is poorly understood, especially due to the lack of Lipschitz smoothness in the algorithm.

Method: The paper achieves its results by reformulating the problem using the outer product of stacked adapter matrices, introducing a modified descent lemma for a 'Lipschitz-like' reparametrized function, and controlling the step size in gradient descent.

Result: The analysis establishes that LoRA gradient descent converges to a stationary point with a convergence rate of O(1/log T), offering new theoretical insights.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for the original LoRA algorithm without relying on artificial Lipschitz smoothness assumptions, thus aligning theory more closely with practical usage.

Abstract: The low-rank adaptation (LoRA) algorithm for fine-tuning large models has grown popular in recent years due to its remarkable performance and low computational requirements. LoRA trains two ``adapter" matrices that form a low-rank representation of the model parameters, thereby massively reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated at every step. Although LoRA is simple, its convergence is poorly understood due to the lack of Lipschitz smoothness, a key condition for classic convergence analyses. As a result, current theoretical results only consider asymptotic behavior or assume strong boundedness conditions which artificially enforce Lipschitz smoothness. In this work, we provide for the first time a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the \textit{original LoRA gradient descent} algorithm, which reflects widespread practice, without such assumptions. Our work relies on three key steps: i) reformulating the problem in terms of the outer product of the stacked adapter matrices, ii) a modified descent lemma for the ``Lipschitz-like" reparametrized function, and iii) controlling the step size. With this approach, we prove that LoRA gradient descent converges to a stationary point at rate $O(\frac{1}{\log T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations.

TL;DR: LeJOT is an intelligent framework that uses machine learning for execution time prediction and optimization to reduce Databricks job costs by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operational costs for dynamic workloads in Databricks remain a challenge due to reliance on static or reactive job configurations.

Method: LeJOT leverages machine learning for execution time prediction and a solver-based model for real-time resource allocation to proactively adapt to workloads.

Result: Experimental tests confirm LeJOT reduces cloud computing costs by 20% and performs faster scheduling compared to traditional strategies.

Conclusion: LeJOT provides an adaptive, scalable method for efficient cost management in dynamic Data Lakehouse environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in big data technologies, the Databricks platform has become a cornerstone for enterprises and research institutions, offering high computational efficiency and a robust ecosystem. However, managing the escalating operational costs associated with job execution remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions rely on static configurations or reactive adjustments, which fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of workloads. To address this, we introduce LeJOT, an intelligent job cost orchestration framework that leverages machine learning for execution time prediction and a solver-based optimization model for real-time resource allocation. Unlike conventional scheduling techniques, LeJOT proactively predicts workload demands, dynamically allocates computing resources, and minimizes costs while ensuring performance requirements are met. Experimental results on real-world Databricks workloads demonstrate that LeJOT achieves an average 20% reduction in cloud computing costs within a minute-level scheduling timeframe, outperforming traditional static allocation strategies. Our approach provides a scalable and adaptive solution for cost-efficient job scheduling in Data Lakehouse environments.

Conclusion: AL GNN delivers competitive results in continual graph learning, resolving privacy and efficiency issues while achieving faster and effective training.

Abstract: Continual graph learning (CGL) aims to enable graph neural networks to incrementally learn from a stream of graph structured data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Existing methods particularly those based on experience replay typically store and revisit past graph data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these approaches pose significant limitations, including privacy concerns, inefficiency. In this work, we propose AL GNN, a novel framework for continual graph learning that eliminates the need for backpropagation and replay buffers. Instead, AL GNN leverages principles from analytic learning theory to formulate learning as a recursive least squares optimization process. It maintains and updates model knowledge analytically through closed form classifier updates and a regularized feature autocorrelation matrix. This design enables efficient one pass training for each task, and inherently preserves data privacy by avoiding historical sample storage. Extensive experiments on multiple dynamic graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that AL GNN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods. For instance, it improves average performance by 10% on CoraFull and reduces forgetting by over 30% on Reddit, while also reducing training time by nearly 50% due to its backpropagation free design.

### [238] [Embedded Safety-Aligned Intelligence via Differentiable Internal Alignment Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18309)
*Harsh Rathva,Ojas Srivastava,Pruthwik Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESAI is a theoretical framework embedding alignment constraints in multi-agent reinforcement learning using internal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of ensuring harm reduction and alignment in multi-agent systems without relying solely on external reward shaping or safety constraints.

Method: Utilizes internal alignment embeddings with mechanisms like counterfactual alignment penalties, attention-based modulation, Hebbian memory, and graph diffusion.

Result: Demonstrates stability conditions, complexity analysis, and theoretical properties of ESAI, aiming for safer and fairer multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Presents ESAI as a novel approach for safety and alignment in multi-agent reinforcement learning with open questions for future research on convergence and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce Embedded Safety-Aligned Intelligence (ESAI), a theoretical framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that embeds alignment constraints directly into agents internal representations using differentiable internal alignment embeddings. Unlike external reward shaping or post-hoc safety constraints, internal alignment embeddings are learned latent variables that predict externalized harm through counterfactual reasoning and modulate policy updates toward harm reduction through attention and graph-based propagation.
  The ESAI framework integrates four mechanisms: differentiable counterfactual alignment penalties computed from soft reference distributions, alignment-weighted perceptual attention, Hebbian associative memory supporting temporal credit assignment, and similarity-weighted graph diffusion with bias mitigation controls. We analyze stability conditions for bounded internal embeddings under Lipschitz continuity and spectral constraints, discuss computational complexity, and examine theoretical properties including contraction behavior and fairness-performance tradeoffs.
  This work positions ESAI as a conceptual contribution to differentiable alignment mechanisms in multi-agent systems. We identify open theoretical questions regarding convergence guarantees, embedding dimensionality, and extension to high-dimensional environments. Empirical evaluation is left to future work.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for industrial compressed air systems, emphasizing safety, energy efficiency, and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for trustworthy and energy-efficient control in industrial compressed air systems, especially under realistic operational conditions.

Method: The framework includes a reinforcement learning approach along with a multi-level explainability pipeline using input perturbation, gradient sensitivity analysis, and SHAP attribution.

Result: The approach demonstrated energy savings (~4%) compared to industrial controllers, while ensuring safe operation and respecting system boundaries.

Conclusion: The work combines efficiency, predictive behaviors, and explainable decisions, making reinforcement learning deployment trustworthy for industrial energy systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a trustworthy reinforcement learning approach for the control of industrial compressed air systems. We develop a framework that enables safe and energy-efficient operation under realistic boundary conditions and introduce a multi-level explainability pipeline combining input perturbation tests, gradient-based sensitivity analysis, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature attribution. An empirical evaluation across multiple compressor configurations shows that the learned policy is physically plausible, anticipates future demand, and consistently respects system boundaries. Compared to the installed industrial controller, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary overpressure and achieves energy savings of approximately 4\,\% without relying on explicit physics models. The results further indicate that system pressure and forecast information dominate policy decisions, while compressor-level inputs play a secondary role. Overall, the combination of efficiency gains, predictive behavior, and transparent validation supports the trustworthy deployment of reinforcement learning in industrial energy systems.

*Xican Yang,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved expert pruning approach for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, addressing deployment challenges and enhancing efficiency by treating MoE as a weighted computation graph and optimizing expert selection globally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the deployment complexity and inefficiencies in activation for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models, particularly focusing on overcoming limitations of existing expert pruning methods relying on local metrics.

Method: The proposed method models MoE as a weighted computation graph and frames expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem, integrating signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength to enable layer-wise non-uniform expert retention.

Result: The approach demonstrated superior pruning performance across nearly all tasks when compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Trajectory-level metrics and a global optimization perspective provide a more effective framework for expert pruning in MoE models, simplifying their deployment and enhancing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures used in large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks yet face practical challenges such as deployment complexity and low activation efficiency. Expert pruning has thus emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational overhead and simplify the deployment of MoE models. However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches.

### [242] [NOVA: Discovering Well-Conditioned Winograd Transforms through Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18453)
*Jayant Lohia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NOVA, a framework that addresses the numerical instability of large tile Winograd convolution, allowing efficient inference in low precision computing. This is achieved by optimizing point selection, significantly improving performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the numerical instability in large tile Winograd convolution when using low precision computing, which has rendered such computations unusable in FP16 or Int8 due to extremely high condition numbers.

Method: The authors introduce NOVA, a discovery framework that treats Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem using Evolution Strategy. The framework finds stable fractional configurations, verifies them symbolically, and ensures their effectiveness as drop-in replacements for traditional transforms.

Result: NOVA reduces the condition number of F(8,3) by 415x in 1D (and 172,484x in 2D convolution). Applied to FP16 ImageNet inference, NOVA improves accuracy from 4.7% to 75-78% on VGG16 without retraining or additional parameters.

Conclusion: NOVA resolves the stability issues of large Winograd convolution tiles, enabling higher efficiency in convolutional computations. It restores full accuracy in low precision scenarios, unlocking potential for future hardware implementations.

Abstract: Winograd convolution is the standard algorithm for efficient inference, reducing arithmetic complexity by 2.25x for 3x3 kernels. However, it faces a critical barrier in the modern era of low precision computing: numerical instability. As tiles scale to maximize efficiency (e.g., F(6,3), F(8,3)), the condition numbers of standard integer based transforms explode, reaching kappa = 2 x 10^5 for F(8,3), rendering them unusable in FP16 or Int8. We introduce NOVA (Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic), a discovery framework that breaks the decades old convention of integer interpolation. Treating Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, NOVA searches the manifold R^n-1 via Evolution Strategy, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification. This process uncovers a hidden landscape of stable, fractional configurations such as {+-5/6, +-7/6, +-3/5} that defy traditional vocabulary constraints. The impact is transformative: NOVA improves the conditioning of F(8,3) by 415x in 1D, which squares to a 172,484x improvement for 2D convolution. In real world FP16 ImageNet inference, where standard transforms collapse to random chance (e.g., 4.7 percent accuracy on VGG16), NOVA's points restore full accuracy (75 to 78 percent), recovering over 70 percentage points without retraining, calibration, or learned parameters. These discovered transforms act as drop in replacements, effectively unlocking the efficiency of large tile Winograd convolution for next generation hardware.

### [243] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in Molecular Complexes via Diffusion Models for Irregular Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18454)
*David Graber,Victor Armegioiu,Rebecca Buller,Siddhartha Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using diffusion models for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in 3D graph data, enhancing model reliability for complex geometric data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often fail on OOD inputs, especially in complex geometric contexts like 3D graphs. Detecting and addressing OOD inputs is critical for reliable deployment of these models.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic framework based on diffusion models, integrating continuous and categorical data into a unified density estimation. By combining continuous features with discrete embeddings via posterior-mean interpolation, they create a self-consistent probability-flow ODE for OOD detection.

Result: The model is validated on protein-ligand datasets, identifying OOD protein families and showing strong correlation with independent model errors. Trajectory statistics enhance OOD detection beyond standard log-likelihood baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based framework effectively detects OOD samples in geometric deep learning. By combining trajectory statistics with scalar likelihoods, it offers a robust, unsupervised solution for OOD quantification.

Abstract: Predictive machine learning models generally excel on in-distribution data, but their performance degrades on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning.

Result: SOM proves effective in visualizing complex data, identifying hidden ecological patterns, and finding correlations among water quality indicators, enhancing assessment methods.

Conclusion: SOM offers versatile approaches for ecological assessments and supports future strategies in sustainable lake and reservoir management.

Abstract: Sustainable water quality underpins ecological balance and water security. Assessing and managing lakes and reservoirs is difficult due to data sparsity, heterogeneity, and nonlinear relationships among parameters. This review examines how Self-Organizing Map (SOM), an unsupervised AI technique, is applied to water quality assessment. It synthesizes research on parameter selection, spatial and temporal sampling strategies, and clustering approaches. Emphasis is placed on how SOM handles multidimensional data and uncovers hidden patterns to support effective water management. The growing availability of environmental data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, IoT technologies, and historical records has significantly expanded analytical opportunities in environmental monitoring. SOM has proven effective in analysing complex datasets, particularly when labelled data are limited or unavailable. It enables high-dimensional data visualization, facilitates the detection of hidden ecological patterns, and identifies critical correlations among diverse water quality indicators. This review highlights SOMs versatility in ecological assessments, trophic state classification, algal bloom monitoring, and catchment area impact evaluations. The findings offer comprehensive insights into existing methodologies, supporting future research and practical applications aimed at improving the monitoring and sustainable management of lake and reservoir ecosystems.

Conclusion: The model enhances diabetes classification through patient-centric and interpretable methods, demonstrating promise for real-time practical applications in healthcare environments.

Abstract: We propose APC-GNN++, an adaptive patient-centric Graph Neural Network for diabetes classification. Our model integrates context-aware edge attention, confidence-guided blending of node features and graph representations, and neighborhood consistency regularization to better capture clinically meaningful relationships between patients. To handle unseen patients, we introduce a mini-graph approach that leverages the nearest neighbors of the new patient, enabling real-time explainable predictions without retraining the global model. We evaluate APC-GNN++ on a real-world diabetes dataset collected from a regional hospital in Algeria and show that it outperforms traditional machine learning models (MLP, Random Forest, XGBoost) and a vanilla GCN, achieving higher test accuracy and macro F1- score. The analysis of node-level confidence scores further reveals how the model balances self-information and graph-based evidence across different patient groups, providing interpretable patient-centric insights. The system is also embedded in a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive use by healthcare professionals .

TL;DR: The study uses machine learning to link drought indices with past impact records to create short-term forecasts. Results show accurate predictions for specific impact categories and support proactive drought management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address increasing drought severity and improve monitoring strategies by predicting impacts to aid proactive decision-making.

Method: Historical drought impact records and indices were analyzed through machine learning (XGBoost), focusing on a combined model of DSCI and ESI data.

Result: Accurate eight-week forecasts for most impact categories, success in predicting Fire and Relief impacts, variability in Plants and Society forecasts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effectiveness in forecasting drought impacts for proactive planning, supporting systems like EcoDri in New Mexico, with potential broader applications.

Abstract: Drought is a complex natural hazard that affects ecological and human systems, often resulting in substantial environmental and economic losses. Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions. The findings can aid stakeholders, land managers, and decision-makers in developing and implementing more effective drought mitigation and adaptation strategies.

TL;DR: The paper explores a hybrid approach by integrating GNNs and graph-theoretic features to classify synthetic graph families, achieving 98.5% accuracy with GraphSAGE and GTN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification of synthetic graph families by combining powerful GNNs with interpretable graph-theoretic features to gain a better understanding of complex synthetic and real-world graph structures.

Method: The authors generated a rich synthetic dataset from five generative graph families, extracted graph features, pruned them with Random Forests, and integrated them into six GNN architectures. Each architecture was optimized using Optuna and compared against a baseline SVM model.

Result: GraphSAGE and GTN outperformed other models with 98.5% classification accuracy. GCN and GIN also performed well, while GAT underperformed. Combining handcrafted features with GNNs improved class separation significantly.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of hybrid models (GNN + graph-theoretic features) for graph family classification, demonstrating high accuracy and validating the importance of message-passing frameworks.

Abstract: The ability to discriminate between generative graph models is critical to understanding complex structural patterns in both synthetic graphs and the real-world structures that they emulate. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have seen increasing use to great effect in graph classification tasks, few studies explore their integration with interpretable graph theoretic features. This paper investigates the classification of synthetic graph families using a hybrid approach that combines GNNs with engineered graph-theoretic features. We generate a large and structurally diverse synthetic dataset comprising graphs from five representative generative families, Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barab'asi-Albert, Holme-Kim, and Stochastic Block Model. These graphs range in size up to 1x10^4 nodes, containing up to 1.1x10^5 edges. A comprehensive range of node and graph level features is extracted for each graph and pruned using a Random Forest based feature selection pipeline. The features are integrated into six GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN, GraphSAGE and GTN. Each architecture is optimised for hyperparameter selection using Optuna. Finally, models were compared against a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained solely on the handcrafted features. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphSAGE and GTN achieve the highest classification performance, with 98.5% accuracy, and strong class separation evidenced by t-SNE and UMAP visualisations. GCN and GIN also performed well, while GAT-based models lagged due to limitations in their ability to capture global structures. The SVM baseline confirmed the importance of the message passing functionality for performance gains and meaningful class separation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SD2AIL, which improves Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) by using synthetic demonstrations generated via diffusion models, coupled with a prioritized replay strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of requiring numerous expert demonstrations for robust performance in imitation learning, which is often impractical or costly to collect.

Method: The authors propose utilizing diffusion models to generate synthetic demonstrations, augmenting expert data. They also integrate a prioritized expert demonstration replay strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning.

Result: Experimental results show that SD2AIL significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving notable improvements such as an average return of 3441 on the Hopper task, exceeding the state-of-the-art by 89.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates the potential of diffusion models in enhancing AIL, offering a more effective and robust learning framework with reduced dependency on extensive expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is a dominant framework in imitation learning that infers rewards from expert demonstrations to guide policy optimization. Although providing more expert demonstrations typically leads to improved performance and greater stability, collecting such demonstrations can be challenging in certain scenarios. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in data generation, we propose SD2AIL, which utilizes synthetic demonstrations via diffusion models. We first employ a diffusion model in the discriminator to generate synthetic demonstrations as pseudo-expert data that augment the expert demonstrations. To selectively replay the most valuable demonstrations from the large pool of (pseudo-) expert demonstrations, we further introduce a prioritized expert demonstration replay strategy (PEDR). The experimental results on simulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. In particular, in the Hopper task, our method achieves an average return of 3441, surpassing the state-of-the-art method by 89. Our code will be available at https://github.com/positron-lpc/SD2AIL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces REALM, a benchmarking framework for neural surrogates in multiphysics that exposes their limitations in realistic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous testing in neural surrogates for multiphysics, especially in realistic, challenging applications.

Method: Developed REALM, a benchmarking framework with 11 datasets, standardized training/evaluation protocols, and tested various neural models.

Result: Identified limitations in current neural surrogates, such as scaling barriers, importance of architectural biases, and discrepancies in performance metrics.

Conclusion: REALM proves existing models struggle with realistic multiphysics and provides a platform to develop improved physics-aware architectures.

Abstract: Predicting multiphysics dynamics is computationally expensive and challenging due to the severe coupling of multi-scale, heterogeneous physical processes. While neural surrogates promise a paradigm shift, the field currently suffers from an "illusion of mastery", as repeatedly emphasized in top-tier commentaries: existing evaluations overly rely on simplified, low-dimensional proxies, which fail to expose the models' inherent fragility in realistic regimes. To bridge this critical gap, we present REALM (REalistic AI Learning for Multiphysics), a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to test neural surrogates on challenging, application-driven reactive flows. REALM features 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning from canonical multiphysics problems to complex propulsion and fire safety scenarios, alongside a standardized end-to-end training and evaluation protocol that incorporates multiphysics-aware preprocessing and a robust rollout strategy. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark over a dozen representative surrogate model families, including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, pointwise operators, and graph/mesh networks, and identify three robust trends: (i) a scaling barrier governed jointly by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity, leading to rapidly growing rollout errors; (ii) performance primarily controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; and (iii) a persistent gap between nominal accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior, where models with high correlations still miss key transient structures and integral quantities. Taken together, REALM exposes the limits of current neural surrogates on realistic multiphysics flows and offers a rigorous testbed to drive the development of next-generation physics-aware architectures.

We target a multi-UAV smart agriculture system where UAVs cooperatively perform data collection, image acquisition, and communication tasks. In this context, we model a Markov decision process to solve the multi-UAV trajectory planning problem. Moreover, we propose a novel Elite Imitation Actor-Shared Ensemble Critic (EIA-SEC) framework, where agents adaptively learn from the elite agent to reduce trial-and-error costs, and a shared ensemble critic collaborates with each agent's local critic to ensure unbiased objective value estimates and prevent overestimation. Experimental results demonstrate that EIA-SEC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of reward performance, training stability, and convergence speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trajectory planning for UAVs in smart agriculture faces challenges like environmental uncertainty, limited observations, and battery constraints.

Method: The trajectory planning problem is formulated as an MDP and solved using multi-agent reinforcement learning with an imitation-based triple deep Q-network (ITDQN) algorithm, including an elite imitation mechanism and mediator Q-network.

Result: The ITDQN algorithm outperformed DDQN, achieving a 4.43% higher weed recognition rate and a 6.94% higher data collection rate in both simulated and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed ITDQN algorithm proves effective and superior, significantly enhancing UAV trajectory planning performance in smart agriculture applications.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising auxiliary platform for smart agriculture, capable of simultaneously performing weed detection, recognition, and data collection from wireless sensors. However, trajectory planning for UAV-based smart agriculture is challenging due to the high uncertainty of the environment, partial observations, and limited battery capacity of UAVs. To address these issues, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a novel imitation-based triple deep Q-network (ITDQN) algorithm, which employs an elite imitation mechanism to reduce exploration costs and utilizes a mediator Q-network over a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to accelerate and stabilize training and improve performance. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. Moreover, our proposed ITDQN outperforms DDQN by 4.43\% in weed recognition rate and 6.94\% in data collection rate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how deep neural networks (DNNs) represent interactions under varying contextual complexities, identifying a bottleneck in mid-order interactions and providing explanations and solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how DNNs encode and represent cooperative interaction structures, which remain insufficiently studied, particularly under varying contextual complexities.

Method: The paper uses multi-order interactions to stratify and analyze interaction structures in DNNs, combining empirical findings, theoretical proofs, and introducing tailored losses to focus models on specific interaction orders.

Result: The study finds a consistent bottleneck in DNNs' representation of mid-order interactions due to inherent contextual variability and gradient variance. Models with low-order emphasis show better generalization and robustness while high-order emphasis leads to improved structural modeling.

Conclusion: The paper establishes interaction order as a fundamental lens for interpreting DNN behavior and improving their representational capacities, addressing biases in how DNNs learn cooperative structures.

Abstract: Understanding what kinds of cooperative structures deep neural networks (DNNs) can represent remains a fundamental yet insufficiently understood problem. In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations.

*Rongyao Cai,Yuxi Wan,Kexin Zhang,Ming Jin,Hao Wang,Zhiqiang Ge,Daoyi Dong,Yong Liu,Qingsong Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the use of point-wise loss functions in time series modeling, identifying biases due to flawed independence assumptions, and offers theoretical analyses and solutions for debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unrecognized biases caused by point-wise loss functions in time series modeling, which conflicts with the causal temporal structure of the data.

Method: The paper theoretically formalizes and quantifies the optimization bias (EOB) caused by incorrect independence assumptions and introduces debiasing methods using sequence length reduction, structural orthogonalization (via DFT/DWT), and a novel harmonized $\ell_p$ norm framework.

Result: It presents the first closed-form quantification of EOB under non-deterministic systems, demonstrating that structured time series suffer more bias, and provides evidence of the generality and effectiveness of the proposed debiasing methods.

Conclusion: The study reveals intrinsic biases in traditional loss functions for time series and proposes practical debiasing solutions validated experimentally, pointing toward more causally-aware optimization frameworks.

Abstract: Optimizing time series models via point-wise loss functions (e.g., MSE) relying on a flawed point-wise independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption that disregards the causal temporal structure, an issue with growing awareness yet lacking formal theoretical grounding. Focusing on the core independence issue under covariance stationarity, this paper aims to provide a first-principles analysis of the Expectation of Optimization Bias (EOB), formalizing it information-theoretically as the discrepancy between the true joint distribution and its flawed i.i.d. counterpart. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigm paradox: the more deterministic and structured the time series, the more severe the bias by point-wise loss function. We derive the first closed-form quantification for the non-deterministic EOB across linear and non-linear systems, and prove EOB is an intrinsic data property, governed exclusively by sequence length and our proposed Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR). This theoretical diagnosis motivates our principled debiasing program that eliminates the bias through sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization. We present a concrete solution that simultaneously achieves both principles via DFT or DWT. Furthermore, a novel harmonized $\ell_p$ norm framework is proposed to rectify gradient pathologies of high-variance series. Extensive experiments validate EOB Theory's generality and the superior performance of debiasing program.

*Han-Seul Jeong,Youngjoon Park,Hyungseok Song,Woohyung Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARC is a learning framework for addressing Vehicle Routing Problems through compositional attribute representations, achieving high performance in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently generalizing across diverse real-world variants of Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs).

Method: ARC employs a compositional learning approach by disentangling attributes into Intrinsic Attribute Embeddings (IAE) and Contextual Interaction Embeddings (CIE), ensuring semantic transformation invariance in embedding space for generalization.

Result: ARC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across in-distribution, zero-shot, few-shot, and real-world benchmarks for VRPs.

Conclusion: ARC effectively generalizes across VRP variants and showcases versatility in handling previously unseen problem combinations using its compositional learning framework.

Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) with diverse real-world attributes have driven recent interest in cross-problem learning approaches that efficiently generalize across problem variants. We propose ARC (Attribute Representation via Compositional Learning), a cross-problem learning framework that learns disentangled attribute representations by decomposing them into two complementary components: an Intrinsic Attribute Embedding (IAE) for invariant attribute semantics and a Contextual Interaction Embedding (CIE) for attribute-combination effects. This disentanglement is achieved by enforcing analogical consistency in the embedding space to ensure the semantic transformation of adding an attribute (e.g., a length constraint) remains invariant across different problem contexts. This enables our model to reuse invariant semantics across trained variants and construct representations for unseen combinations. ARC achieves state-of-the-art performance across in-distribution, zero-shot generalization, few-shot adaptation, and real-world benchmarks.

*Xue Yang,Michael Schukat,Junlin Lu,Patrick Mannion,Karl Mason,Enda Howley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces demonstration-guided continual reinforcement learning (DGCRL) to address stability-plasticity issues in evolving environments, using external demonstrations to guide exploration and learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning struggles in dynamic environments due to evolving Markov decision processes. Balancing stability (retain prior knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge) is challenging in continual reinforcement learning.

Method: DGCRL stores prior knowledge in a self-evolving demonstration repository and dynamically selects relevant demonstrations for guided exploration and adaptation, gradually promoting self-exploration.

Result: DGCRL shows superior performance, better knowledge transfer, reduced forgetting, and improved training efficiency on 2D navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstration-guided continual reinforcement learning effectively mitigates forgetting and accelerates learning, providing a novel approach to address stability-plasticity issues in continual reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in various applications but struggles in dynamic environments where the underlying Markov decision process evolves. Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) enables RL agents to continually learn and adapt to new tasks, but balancing stability (preserving prior knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge) remains challenging. Existing methods primarily address the stability-plasticity dilemma through mechanisms where past knowledge influences optimization but rarely affects the agent's behavior directly, which may hinder effective knowledge reuse and efficient learning. In contrast, we propose demonstration-guided continual reinforcement learning (DGCRL), which stores prior knowledge in an external, self-evolving demonstration repository that directly guides RL exploration and adaptation. For each task, the agent dynamically selects the most relevant demonstration and follows a curriculum-based strategy to accelerate learning, gradually shifting from demonstration-guided exploration to fully self-exploration. Extensive experiments on 2D navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks demonstrate its superior average performance, enhanced knowledge transfer, mitigation of forgetting, and training efficiency. The additional sensitivity analysis and ablation study further validate its effectiveness.

*Ning Lyu,Junjie Jiang,Lu Chang,Chihui Shao,Feng Chen,Chong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new graph modeling method focused on improving anomaly identification in complex scheduling systems by leveraging structure-aware techniques and multi-scale graph semantic aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of accurately identifying anomalies in complex and dynamic scheduling behaviors, especially in scenarios involving multi-task concurrency, resource competition, and stage transitions.

Method: It introduces a structure-guided scheduling graph construction to encode scheduling tasks dynamically and integrates a multi-scale graph semantic aggregation module to improve detection of anomalies by aligning global and local semantic features.

Result: The proposed model outperforms other methods in experiments using real scheduling datasets, showing higher sensitivity to structural disturbances, semantic shifts, and other anomalies.

Conclusion: The method strengthens anomaly separability and enriches pattern representation in scheduling behavior graphs, proving effective in anomaly detection for complex scheduling scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a structure-aware driven scheduling graph modeling method to improve the accuracy and representation capability of anomaly identification in scheduling behaviors of complex systems. The method first designs a structure-guided scheduling graph construction mechanism that integrates task execution stages, resource node states, and scheduling path information to build dynamically evolving scheduling behavior graphs, enhancing the model's ability to capture global scheduling relationships. On this basis, a multi-scale graph semantic aggregation module is introduced to achieve semantic consistency modeling of scheduling features through local adjacency semantic integration and global topology alignment, thereby strengthening the model's capability to capture abnormal features in complex scenarios such as multi-task concurrency, resource competition, and stage transitions. Experiments are conducted on a real scheduling dataset with multiple scheduling disturbance paths set to simulate different types of anomalies, including structural shifts, resource changes, and task delays. The proposed model demonstrates significant performance advantages across multiple metrics, showing a sensitive response to structural disturbances and semantic shifts. Further visualization analysis reveals that, under the combined effect of structure guidance and semantic aggregation, the scheduling behavior graph exhibits stronger anomaly separability and pattern representation, validating the effectiveness and adaptability of the method in scheduling anomaly detection tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EEG-CSANet, a cutting-edge EEG signal decoding model with both main and auxiliary branches for improved spatiotemporal feature extraction, achieving SOTA performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the decoding of EEG signals, which are spatially and temporally heterogeneous, for better performance in brain-machine interfacing and intelligent interaction.

Method: The proposed method involves a multi-branch parallel architecture for different temporal scales, incorporating multiscale self-attention in the main branch, and sparse cross-attention in the auxiliary branch for effective multi-feature fusion.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on five public datasets, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: EEG-CSANet is positioned as a potential baseline in EEG decoding research, capable of enabling more accurate and interpretable brain signal decoding solutions.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signal decoding is a key technology that translates brain activity into executable commands, laying the foundation for direct brain-machine interfacing and intelligent interaction. To address the inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity of EEG signals, this paper proposes a multi-branch parallel architecture, where each temporal scale is equipped with an independent spatial feature extraction module. To further enhance multi-branch feature fusion, we propose a Fusion of Multiscale Features via Centralized Sparse-attention Network (EEG-CSANet), a centralized sparse-attention network. It employs a main-auxiliary branch architecture, where the main branch models core spatiotemporal patterns via multiscale self-attention, and the auxiliary branch facilitates efficient local interactions through sparse cross-attention. Experimental results show that EEG-CSANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five public datasets (BCIC-IV-2A, BCIC-IV-2B, HGD, SEED, and SEED-VIG), with accuracies of 88.54%, 91.09%, 99.43%, 96.03%, and 90.56%, respectively. Such performance demonstrates its strong adaptability and robustness across various EEG decoding tasks. Moreover, extensive ablation studies are conducted to enhance the interpretability of EEG-CSANet. In the future, we hope that EEG-CSANet could serve as a promising baseline model in the field of EEG signal decoding.

### [258] [Generating Risky Samples with Conformity Constraints via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18722)
*Han Yu,Hao Zou,Xingxuan Zhang,Zhengyi Wang,Yue He,Kehan Li,Peng Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RiskyDiff, a method that uses text and image embeddings and a conformity score to generate diverse and risky samples for evaluation, addressing limitations of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of diversity in risky sample generation, as previous methods are constrained by existing datasets or introduce label noise when using diffusion models.

Method: RiskyDiff employs implicit constraints using text and image embeddings, a conformity score to strengthen category conformity, embedding screening, and risky gradient guidance to enhance sample risk.

Result: RiskyDiff outperforms existing methods in risk, generation quality, and category conformity, while also improving model generalization through data augmentation.

Conclusion: RiskyDiff provides a superior approach for generating risky samples with high conformity and demonstrates potential in enhancing model robustness through data augmentation.

Abstract: Although neural networks achieve promising performance in many tasks, they may still fail when encountering some examples and bring about risks to applications. To discover risky samples, previous literature attempts to search for patterns of risky samples within existing datasets or inject perturbation into them. Yet in this way the diversity of risky samples is limited by the coverage of existing datasets. To overcome this limitation, recent works adopt diffusion models to produce new risky samples beyond the coverage of existing datasets. However, these methods struggle in the conformity between generated samples and expected categories, which could introduce label noise and severely limit their effectiveness in applications. To address this issue, we propose RiskyDiff that incorporates the embeddings of both texts and images as implicit constraints of category conformity. We also design a conformity score to further explicitly strengthen the category conformity, as well as introduce the mechanisms of embedding screening and risky gradient guidance to boost the risk of generated samples. Extensive experiments reveal that RiskyDiff greatly outperforms existing methods in terms of the degree of risk, generation quality, and conformity with conditioned categories. We also empirically show the generalization ability of the models can be enhanced by augmenting training data with generated samples of high conformity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of GPU inference scheduling systems in ML, proposing methods to better predict and manage interference for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of balancing GPU utilization with meeting latency-sensitive deadlines effectively in ML inference systems.

Method: The work evaluates current interference prediction methods, identifying their coarse-grained nature and lack of adaptability, and proposes dynamic approaches to improve scheduling.

Result: The paper outlines limitations of existing methods and presents ongoing work toward more accurate and efficient scheduling mechanisms.

Conclusion: A more precise and adaptable interference prediction system is crucial for enhancing ML inference scheduling on GPUs while maintaining SLO compliance.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) inference serving systems can schedule requests to improve GPU utilization and to meet service level objectives (SLOs) or deadlines. However, improving GPU utilization may compromise latency-sensitive scheduling, as concurrent tasks contend for GPU resources and thereby introduce interference. Given that interference effects introduce unpredictability in scheduling, neglecting them may compromise SLO or deadline satisfaction. Nevertheless, existing interference prediction approaches remain limited in several respects, which may restrict their usefulness for scheduling. First, they are often coarse-grained, which ignores runtime co-location dynamics and thus restricts their accuracy in interference prediction. Second, they tend to use a static prediction model, which may not effectively cope with different workload characteristics. To this end, we evaluate the potential limitations of existing interference prediction approaches and outline our ongoing work toward achieving efficient ML inference scheduling.

*Zhiquan Tan,Yinrong Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified variational analysis for large language models (LLMs) trained with KL-regularized reinforcement learning, addressing instruction following and reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal deeper theoretical insights into the performance of LLMs trained with KL-regularized reinforcement learning, especially their instruction-following, reasoning, and self-correcting capabilities.

Method: The authors exploit the closed-form energy-based model structure of optimal KL-regularized policies and analyze both instruction-tuned and reasoning models under specific theoretical assumptions.

Result: They establish that instruction-tuned models satisfy detailed balance, ensuring quality improvement and efficient convergence. They also show reasoning models minimize expected KL divergence to an optimal distribution, explaining observed entropy-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The paper offers a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the behavior of KL-regularized LLMs, demonstrating how these models achieve quality convergence and effective reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via KL-regularized reinforcement learning demonstrate strong instruction following, self-correction, and reasoning abilities. Yet their theoretical underpinnings remain limited. We exploit the closed-form energy-based model (EBM) structure of the optimal KL-regularized policy to provide a unified variational analysis of LLMs.
  For instruction-tuned models, under natural assumptions on reward potentials and pretraining symmetry, we prove that the transition kernel satisfies detailed balance with respect to a scalar potential encoding response quality. This yields monotonic KL convergence to a high-quality stationary distribution, bounded hitting times to superior states, and exponential mixing governed by the spectral gap.
  For reasoning models trained with verifiable rewards (RLVR), we show the objective is equivalent to expected KL minimization toward an optimal reasoning distribution, with the suboptimality gap reducing to the Bernoulli KL between target and current accuracies along the natural gradient flow. This helps explain empirical entropy-accuracy trade-offs.

### [261] [Is Your Conditional Diffusion Model Actually Denoising?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18736)
*Daniel Pfrommer,Zehao Dou,Christopher Scarvelis,Max Simchowitz,Ali Jadbabaie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates the inductive biases in conditioning-variable diffusion models and introduces a measure called Schedule Deviation to capture their divergence from ideal denoising processes, regardless of model capacity or data. It suggests that the issue arises due to smoothness biases in bridging distinct conditioning flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why conditional diffusion models deviate from their ideal denoising processes and how this impacts their performance in diverse areas like text-conditioned image generation and continuous control.

Method: The researchers observe deviations in model outputs from idealized denoising, define the Schedule Deviation measure to quantify these deviations, and provide both empirical and theoretical analysis.

Result: They find that deviations from the ideal denoising process occur universally, independent of model capacity or training data size, and are linked to challenges in bridging denoising flows across the conditioning space.

Conclusion: The study highlights a fundamental smoothness-induced inductive bias in conditional diffusion models that affects their generative capabilities, suggesting a need for future design improvements to address these limitations.

Abstract: We study the inductive biases of diffusion models with a conditioning-variable, which have seen widespread application as both text-conditioned generative image models and observation-conditioned continuous control policies. We observe that when these models are queried conditionally, their generations consistently deviate from the idealized "denoising" process upon which diffusion models are formulated, inducing disagreement between popular sampling algorithms (e.g. DDPM, DDIM). We introduce Schedule Deviation, a rigorous measure which captures the rate of deviation from a standard denoising process, and provide a methodology to compute it. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deviation from an idealized denoising process occurs irrespective of the model capacity or amount of training data. We posit that this phenomenon occurs due to the difficulty of bridging distinct denoising flows across different parts of the conditioning space and show theoretically how such a phenomenon can arise through an inductive bias towards smoothness.

### [262] [PIPCFR: Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18737)
*Zichuan Lin,Xiaokai Huang,Jiate Liu,Yuxuan Han,Jia Chen,Xiapeng Wu,Deheng Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method (PIPCFR) to estimate individual treatment effects more accurately by incorporating post-treatment variables into pseudo-outcome imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating individual treatment effects often overlook the role of post-treatment variables, leading to higher variance and less accurate predictions.

Method: PIPCFR utilizes post-treatment variables in its pseudo-outcome imputation process and incorporates theoretical analysis of their impact on ITE estimation accuracy.

Result: Empirical evaluations on real-world and simulated datasets confirm that PIPCFR reduces ITE errors significantly compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The incorporation of post-treatment variables via PIPCFR improves predictions of individual treatment effects and addresses limitations of existing approaches through better representation learning.

Abstract: The estimation of individual treatment effects (ITE) focuses on predicting the outcome changes that result from a change in treatment. A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment. Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gaussian mixture models (GMM-QFs) as direct surrogates for Q-function losses in RL, offering competitive performance with reduced computational costs compared to deep-learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning Q-function approximation often relies on computationally expensive methods; this paper seeks to introduce an alternative approach using GMMs for efficiency and representational capability.

Method: The authors use Gaussian mixture models (GMM-QFs) embedded in Bellman residuals and optimize parameters on a Riemannian manifold to approximate Q-function losses.

Result: GMM-QFs achieve competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods across RL tasks, despite not using experience data, and exhibit lower computational costs compared to deep-learning alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed GMM-QF approach presents a robust, efficient, and theoretically sound alternative for Q-function loss approximation in RL, reducing reliance on experience data and computational resources.

Abstract: Unlike their conventional use as estimators of probability density functions in reinforcement learning (RL), this paper introduces a novel function-approximation role for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as direct surrogates for Q-function losses. These parametric models, termed GMM-QFs, possess substantial representational capacity, as they are shown to be universal approximators over a broad class of functions. They are further embedded within Bellman residuals, where their learnable parameters -- a fixed number of mixing weights, together with Gaussian mean vectors and covariance matrices -- are inferred from data via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. This geometric perspective on the parameter space naturally incorporates Riemannian optimization into the policy-evaluation step of standard policy-iteration frameworks. Rigorous theoretical results are established, and supporting numerical tests show that, even without access to experience data, GMM-QFs deliver competitive performance and, in some cases, outperform state-of-the-art approaches across a range of benchmark RL tasks, all while maintaining a significantly smaller computational footprint than deep-learning methods that rely on experience data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GDOF, a label-informed outlier detection method for heterogeneous data using Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets, excelling in detecting outliers with minimal labeled samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the limitations of existing semi-supervised outlier detection methods, which fail to capture the heterogeneity and uncertainty of real-world data due to their focus on purely numerical and deterministic approaches.

Method: The method involves label-informed fuzzy granulation to represent data types, granule density for density estimation, and a mechanism to integrate densities for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with limited labeled outliers.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets show GDOF's effectiveness in detecting outliers within complex heterogeneous data with very few labeled samples.

Conclusion: GDOF provides a robust framework for semi-supervised outlier detection, leveraging Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing. The method is validated as particularly practical and effective for diverse, real-world applications, and resources are accessible for extended research.

Abstract: Outlier detection, crucial for identifying unusual patterns with significant implications across numerous applications, has drawn considerable research interest. Existing semi-supervised methods typically treat data as purely numerical and} in a deterministic manner, thereby neglecting the heterogeneity and uncertainty inherent in complex, real-world datasets. This paper introduces a label-informed outlier detection method for heterogeneous data based on Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets, namely Granule Density-based Outlier Factor (GDOF). Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers. The integration of Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing in GDOF offers a practical framework for outlier detection in complex and diverse data types. All relevant datasets and source codes are publicly available for further research. This is the author's accepted manuscript of a paper published in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems.

*Mateusz Oszczypała,David Ibehej,Jakub Kudela*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper addresses redundancy allocation in repairable systems by optimizing cost and availability through metaheuristics and highlights dominant redundancy strategies based on constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust solutions for redundancy allocation in repairable systems by balancing cost minimization and availability maximization while comparing metaheuristic approaches.

Method: The study uses continuous-time Markov chains for availability evaluation and benchmark comparisons of 65 multi-objective metaheuristics under different initialization settings across six complex case studies.

Result: Hot standby and mixed redundancy strategies dominate Pareto-optimal solutions under varying weight limits. SBI initialization improves hypervolume performance and alters method rankings based on budget settings.

Conclusion: Effective planning of evaluation budgets is crucial for succeeding in large system designs. SBI initialization significantly boosts optimization results and offers promising benchmarks for RAP studies.

Abstract: This article investigates a bi-objective redundancy allocation problem (RAP) for repairable systems, defined as cost minimization and availability maximization. Binary decisions jointly select the number of components and the standby strategy at the subsystem level. Four redundancy strategies are considered: cold standby, warm standby, hot standby, and a mixed strategy. System availability is evaluated using continuous-time Markov chains. The main novelty is a large, controlled benchmark that compares 65 multi-objective metaheuristics under two initialization settings, with and without Scaled Binomial Initialization (SBI), on six case studies of rising structural and dimensional complexity and four weight limits. Each run uses a fixed budget of 2x10^6 evaluations, and repeated runs support statistical comparisons based on hypervolume and budget-based performance. The Pareto-optimal sets are dominated by hot standby and mixed redundancy, while cold and warm standby are rare in the full populations and almost absent from the Pareto fronts. Hot standby is favored under tight weight limits, whereas mixed redundancy becomes dominant when more spares are allowed. Algorithm results show strong budget effects, so a single overall ranking can be misleading. SBI gives a clear hypervolume gain and can change method rankings; in several cases, the SBI initial population is already close to the best-found reference. NSGAIIARSBX-SBI performs well for medium and large budgets, while NNIA-SBI and CMOPSO-SBI are strongest when the budget is tight. Finally, larger systems require much more search effort to reach high-quality fronts, highlighting the need to plan the evaluation budget in practical RAP studies. The code and the results are available at a Zenodo repository https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17981720.

*Wei Liu,Tao Zhang,Chenhui Lin,Kaiwen Li,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper develops a new algorithm, L-MVNS, for urban underground cable routing that achieves significant cost reductions and improves routing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of urban underground cable construction and the constraints imposed by road layouts create a need for efficient and optimized planning solutions.

Method: The L-MVNS algorithm combines a hybrid genetic search with A* for connectivity and route-planning optimization, integrates variable neighborhood search with novel operators, and employs multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for prioritization. A scalable benchmark suite is also constructed.

Result: The L-MVNS algorithm significantly reduces total construction costs (30-50%) compared to existing methods, offering higher stability and effectiveness, especially in larger instances.

Conclusion: The proposed L-MVNS algorithm effectively addresses the challenges of urban cable routing, improving cost efficiency and scalability, and sets a new standard for evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Urban underground cable construction is essential for enhancing the reliability of city power grids, yet its high construction costs make planning a worthwhile optimization task. In urban environments, road layouts tightly constrain cable routing. This, on the one hand, renders relation-only models (i.e., those without explicit routes) used in prior work overly simplistic, and on the other hand, dramatically enlarges the combinatorial search space, thereby imposing much higher demands on algorithm design. In this study, we formulate urban cable routing as a connectivity-path co-optimization problem and propose a learning-assisted multi-operator variable neighborhood search (L-MVNS) algorithm. The framework first introduces an auxiliary task to generate high-quality feasible initial solutions. A hybrid genetic search (HGS) and A* serve as the connectivity optimizer and the route-planning optimizer, respectively. Building on these, a multi-operator variable neighborhood search (MVNS) iteratively co-optimizes inter-substation connectivity and detailed routes via three complementary destruction operators, a modified A* repair operator, and an adaptive neighborhood-sizing mechanism. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning module is further embedded to prioritize promising neighborhoods. We also construct a standardized and scalable benchmark suite for evaluation. Across these cases, comprehensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and stability: relative to representative approaches, MVNS and L-MVNS reduce total construction cost by approximately 30-50%, with L-MVNS delivering additional gains on larger instances and consistently higher stability.

It couples a DeepFlow-based frontend that generates hardware-aware, operator-level Chakra execution traces from an abstract LLM specification (model shape, batch/sequence settings, training vs. inference, and hybrid parallelism choices) with an extended Astra-Sim backend that executes those traces on explicit multi-dimensional network topologies with congestion-aware routing and support for degraded and faulty links. The frontend assigns per-operator latency using a tile-based model that accounts for SM under-utilization and multi-level memory traffic (SRAM/ L2/ HBM), and prunes memory-infeasible configurations using an activation-liveness traversal under recomputation, parallelism and ZeRO/FDSP sharding policies.
  Across A100-based validation cases, RAPID-LLM predicts Llama inference step latency and GPT-scale training time per batch within 10.4\% relative to published measurements, and matches ns-3 packet-level results within 8\% on representative communication workloads. Case studies demonstrate how RAPID-LLM enables fast, exhaustive sweeps over hybrid-parallel configurations, quantifies sensitivity to soft link faults under realistic routing and congestion, and evaluates hypothetical GPU design variants including HBM bandwidth throttling effects.

### [268] [Optimal Software Pipelining and Warp Specialization for Tensor Core GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18134)
*Rupanshu Soi,Rohan Yadav,Fredrik Kjolstad,Alex Aiken,Maryam Mehri Dehnavi,Michael Garland,Michael Bauer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Twill, an optimization system for generating efficient GPU schedules by addressing software pipelining and warp specialization as a joint optimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently scheduling GPU computations is complex due to the architecture's growing complexity, requiring tools to replace existing brittle heuristics and intuition-based approaches.

Method: The authors formulated software pipelining and warp specialization as a joint optimization problem solved with constraint solvers, creating a system called Twill.

Result: Twill can derive optimal schedules for a wide range of GPU programs and revalidate the correctness of expert-developed schedules for specific hardware architectures.

Conclusion: Twill simplifies optimization for GPUs, eliminates reliance on unreliable heuristics, and guarantees optimality, making it extensible across various GPU architectures.

Abstract: GPU architectures have continued to grow in complexity, with recent incarnations introducing increasingly powerful fixed-function units for matrix multiplication and data movement to accompany highly parallel general-purpose cores. To fully leverage these machines, software must use sophisticated schedules that maximally utilize all hardware resources. Since realizing such schedules is complex, both programmers and compilers routinely employ program transformations, such as software pipelining (SWP) and warp specialization (WS), to do so in practice. However, determining how best to use SWP and WS in combination is a challenging problem that is currently handled through a mix of brittle compilation heuristics and fallible human intuition, with little insight into the space of solutions. To remedy this situation, we introduce a novel formulation of SWP and WS as a joint optimization problem that can be solved holistically by off-the-shelf constraint solvers. We reify our approach in Twill, the first system that automatically derives optimal SWP and WS schedules for a large class of iterative programs. Twill is heuristic-free, easily extensible to new GPU architectures, and guaranteed to produce optimal schedules. We show that Twill can rediscover, and thereby prove optimal, the SWP and WS schedules manually developed by experts for Flash Attention on both the NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell GPU architectures.

*Aleksandr Fedchin,Antero Mejr,Hari Sundar,Jeffrey S. Foster*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: DafnyMPI is a novel library enabling formal verification of MPI software, ensuring deadlock freedom, termination, and functional correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Writing bug-free software for MPI is challenging due to its parallel and high-performance programming intricacies.

Method: DafnyMPI leverages Dafny, a verification-ready programming language, extending it for concurrent reasoning. It requires users to define communication topology and verify MPI primitives' preconditions.

Result: Deadlock freedom is guaranteed by preconditions formalized in a core calculus. Functional equivalence is established through rely-guarantee reasoning. Termination and absence of runtime errors are verified using Dafny techniques.

Conclusion: DafnyMPI shows formal verification can be extended to a broader class of parallel and concurrent programs, providing proof engineers additional tools for reliable software development.

Abstract: The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is widely used in parallel, high-performance programming, yet writing bug-free software that uses MPI remains difficult. We introduce DafnyMPI, a novel, scalable approach to formally verifying MPI software. DafnyMPI allows proving deadlock freedom, termination, and functional equivalence with simpler sequential implementations. In contrast to existing specialized frameworks, DafnyMPI avoids custom concurrency logics and instead relies on Dafny, a verification-ready programming language used for sequential programs, extending it with concurrent reasoning abilities. DafnyMPI is implemented as a library that enables safe MPI programming by requiring users to specify the communication topology upfront and to verify that calls to communication primitives such as MPI_ISEND and MPI_WAIT meet their preconditions. We formalize DafnyMPI using a core calculus and prove that the preconditions suffice to guarantee deadlock freedom. Functional equivalence is proved via rely-guarantee reasoning over message payloads and a system that guarantees safe use of read and write buffers. Termination and the absence of runtime errors are proved using standard Dafny techniques. To further demonstrate the applicability of DafnyMPI, we verify numerical solutions to three canonical partial differential equations. We believe DafnyMPI demonstrates how to make formal verification viable for a broader class of programs and provides proof engineers with additional tools for software verification of parallel and concurrent systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an untethered thin soft robot (UTS-Robot) powered by low-voltage thin dielectric elastomer actuators (TS-DEA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for low-profile untethered soft robots capable of accessing millimetre-scale confined spaces with reduced dependency on high voltage and wired connections.

Method: Development of TS-DEA with dual-actuation sandwiched structure and thin elastomer fabrication (spin coating and biaxial stretching). Integration of onboard electronics for untethered actuation.

Result: The robot achieved locomotion speeds of 12.36 mm/s in bare configuration and 0.5 mm/s in untethered operation, demonstrating its efficacy in navigating confined environments.

Conclusion: The UTS-Robot design showcases advancements in soft robotics with high power density, low-voltage actuation, and suitability for complex narrow-space applications.

Abstract: Thin dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) features a unique in-plane configuration, enabling low-profile designs capable of accessing millimetre-scale narrow spaces. However, most existing DEA-powered soft robots require high voltages and wired power connections, limiting their ability to operate in confined environments. This study presents an untethered thin soft robot (UTS-Robot) powered by thin dielectric elastomer actuators (TS-DEA). The robot measures 38 mm in length, 6 mm in height, and weighs just 2.34 grams, integrating flexible onboard electronics to achieve fully untethered actuation. The TS-DEA, operating at resonant frequencies of 86 Hz under a low driving voltage of 220 V, adopts a dual-actuation sandwiched structure, comprising four dielectric elastomer layers bonded to a compressible tensioning mechanism at its core. This design enables high power density actuation and locomotion via three directional friction pads. The low-voltage actuation is achieved by fabricating each elastomer layer via spin coating to an initial thickness of 50 um, followed by biaxial stretching to 8 um. A comprehensive design and modelling framework has been developed to optimise TS-DEA performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the bare TS-DEA achieves a locomotion speed of 12.36 mm/s at resonance, the untethered configuration achieves a locomotion speed of 0.5 mm/s, making it highly suitable for navigating confined and complex environments.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal framework for human-robot interaction intent detection that fuses pose and emotion analysis. It achieves high accuracy with resource-efficient hardware, addressing dataset imbalances via a novel generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance intent detection in service robots using lightweight and resource-constrained hardware for real-time and robust interactions in public spaces.

Method: The method fuses 2D skeletal poses and facial emotion features from monocular RGB video, balanced using a novel generation method (MINT-RVAE) for data synthesis.

Result: The model achieves AUROC of 0.95 offline and demonstrates 91% accuracy and 100% recall in real-world trials, validating its cross-sensor and cross-environment robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is robust, practical, and effective for real-time human-robot intent detection, showing potential for social robotics deployment.

Abstract: Service robots in public spaces require real-time understanding of human behavioral intentions for natural interaction. We present a practical multimodal framework for frame-accurate human-robot interaction intent detection that fuses camera-invariant 2D skeletal pose and facial emotion features extracted from monocular RGB video. Unlike prior methods requiring RGB-D sensors or GPU acceleration, our approach resource-constrained embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi 5, CPU-only). To address the severe class imbalance in natural human-robot interaction datasets, we introduce a novel approach to synthesize temporally coherent pose-emotion-label sequences for data re-balancing called MINT-RVAE (Multimodal Recurrent Variational Autoencoder for Intent Sequence Generation). Comprehensive offline evaluations under cross-subject and cross-scene protocols demonstrate strong generalization performance, achieving frame- and sequence-level AUROC of 0.95. Crucially, we validate real-world generalization through cross-camera evaluation on the MIRA robot head, which employs a different onboard RGB sensor and operates in uncontrolled environments not represented in the training data. Despite this domain shift, the deployed system achieves 91% accuracy and 100% recall across 32 live interaction trials. The close correspondence between offline and deployed performance confirms the cross-sensor and cross-environment robustness of the proposed multimodal approach, highlighting its suitability for ubiquitous multimedia-enabled social robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniPred is a bilevel learning framework combining top-down and bottom-up approaches to enhance robotic task-solving through symbolic world modeling. It iteratively refines predicate learning using large language models and low-level data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon robotic tasks are challenging due to large continuous state-action spaces and sparse feedback. Symbolic world models decompose tasks into manageable discrete predicates, but existing methods struggle to balance using foundation models without grounding or learning solely from data without priors.

Method: UniPred integrates LLMs to propose predicate effect distributions for supervising neural predicate learning and refines these proposals iteratively with feedback from learned models, leveraging advanced visual features.

Result: UniPred achieves 2-4 times higher success rates over existing top-down methods and 3-4 times faster learning compared to bottom-up methods. Its robust predicates perform well under challenging, cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: UniPred demonstrates scalable and flexible symbolic world modeling for robotics, effectively bridging the gap between foundational and data-driven methodologies.

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic tasks are hard due to continuous state-action spaces and sparse feedback. Symbolic world models help by decomposing tasks into discrete predicates that capture object properties and relations. Existing methods learn predicates either top-down, by prompting foundation models without data grounding, or bottom-up, from demonstrations without high-level priors. We introduce UniPred, a bilevel learning framework that unifies both. UniPred uses large language models (LLMs) to propose predicate effect distributions that supervise neural predicate learning from low-level data, while learned feedback iteratively refines the LLM hypotheses. Leveraging strong visual foundation model features, UniPred learns robust predicate classifiers in cluttered scenes. We further propose a predicate evaluation method that supports symbolic models beyond STRIPS assumptions. Across five simulated and one real-robot domains, UniPred achieves 2-4 times higher success rates than top-down methods and 3-4 times faster learning than bottom-up approaches, advancing scalable and flexible symbolic world modeling for robotics.

*Yu Fang,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Le Xue,Honglu Zhou,Juntao Tan,Ran Xu,Shelby Heinecke,Caiming Xiong,Silvio Savarese,Daniel Szafir,Mingyu Ding,Michael S. Ryoo,Juan Carlos Niebles*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel joint learning approach integrating motion reasoning into Vision-Language-Action models to significantly improve robotic manipulation outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models are limited in predictive motion reasoning, reducing their efficacy in deciding appropriate actions.

Method: The method adds a dual-head design to VLA models, incorporating an action prediction head and a motion prediction head (using a Diffusion Transformer) to jointly train motion-aware representations.

Result: Experiments show an improvement to 97.5% success rate on LIBERO and 58.0% on RoboTwin benchmarks, with a 23% enhancement in real-world performance.

Conclusion: Joint learning with motion image diffusion enhances motion reasoning in VLA models, resulting in more accurate and effective robotic manipulation outcomes.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by mapping multimodal observations and instructions directly to actions. However, they typically mimic expert trajectories without predictive motion reasoning, which limits their ability to reason about what actions to take. To address this limitation, we propose joint learning with motion image diffusion, a novel strategy that enhances VLA models with motion reasoning capabilities. Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs.

*Tin Stribor Sohn,Maximilian Dillitzer,Jason J. Corso,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Embodied4C, a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in embodied scenarios such as autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, and robotic manipulators. It assesses four reasoning dimensions: semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of benchmarks that sufficiently evaluate VLMs' performance under the constraints of embodiment, which includes physical platform and sensor configurations.

Method: The authors designed Embodied4C with 1.1K reasoning questions and 58 navigation tasks across heterogeneous embodiments, focusing on dynamic configurations and domain-far queries for robust evaluation.

Result: Ten VLMs and four embodied control baselines were evaluated, revealing that instruction tuning and cross-modal alignment are crucial for performance. Spatial and temporal reasoning remain key challenges.

Conclusion: Embodied4C shows that embodiment introduces unique challenges to VLMs, highlighting the importance of improving spatial and temporal reasoning and cross-modal capabilities for reliable embodied systems.

Abstract: Vision-language navigation requires agents to reason and act under constraints of embodiment. While vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong generalization, current benchmarks provide limited understanding of how embodiment -- i.e., the choice of physical platform, sensor configuration, and modality alignment -- influences perception, reasoning, and control. We introduce Embodied4C, a closed-loop benchmark designed as a Turing test for embodied reasoning. The benchmark evaluates the core embodied capabilities of VLMs across three heterogeneous embodiments -- autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, and robotic manipulators -- through approximately 1.1K one-shot reasoning questions and 58 goal-directed navigation tasks. These tasks jointly assess four foundational dimensions: semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical reasoning. Each embodiment presents dynamic sensor configurations and environment variations to probe generalization beyond platform-specific adaptation. To prevent embodiment overfitting, Embodied4C integrates domain-far queries targeting abstract and cross-context reasoning. Comprehensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art VLMs and four embodied control baselines shows that cross-modal alignment and instruction tuning matter more than scale, while spatial and temporal reasoning remains the primary bottleneck for reliable embodied competence.

*Jacqueline Borgstedt,Jake Bhattacharyya,Matteo Iovino,Frank E. Pollick,Stephen Brewster*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tactile prototype to enhance the PARO SAR by adding warmth, heartbeat, and purring sensations for more lifelike, emotionally engaging interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current socially assistive robots lack advanced haptic cues such as warmth, heartbeat, or purring, limiting emotionally engaging interactions for those unable to access animal companionship.

Method: The authors developed a multimodal tactile prototype with flexible heating and vibrotactile feedback to mimic biophysiological signals like warmth, heartbeats, and purring, designed iteratively with user and expert feedback.

Result: The prototype successfully enhances the PARO robot with thermal and vibrotactile cues that simulate lifelike and emotionally resonant interactions.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the potential of integrating advanced tactile cues into SARs and offers design guidelines to improve their emotional and physical interaction quality.

Abstract: Zoomorphic Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) offer an alternative source of social touch for individuals who cannot access animal companionship. However, current SARs provide only limited, passive touch-based interactions and lack the rich haptic cues, such as warmth, heartbeat or purring, that are characteristic of human-animal touch. This limits their ability to evoke emotionally engaging, life-like physical interactions.
  We present a multimodal tactile prototype, which was used to augment the established PARO robot, integrating thermal and vibrotactile feedback to simulate feeling biophysiological signals. A flexible heating interface delivers body-like warmth, while embedded actuators generate heartbeat-like rhythms and continuous purring sensations. These cues were iteratively designed and calibrated with input from users and haptics experts. We outline the design process and offer reproducible guidelines to support the development of emotionally resonant and biologically plausible touch interactions with SARs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores using laser micromachining for fabricating polyimide robotic cannulas for neurosurgery, focusing on their flexibility and loading behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neurosurgical tools by reducing interference with MRI, improving safety, and reducing tissue damage using compliant polymer materials.

Method: Laser micromachining was employed to fabricate polyimide cannulas with small-diameter joints, evaluating various sizes and experimentally analyzing their loading behavior.

Result: Polyimide joints as small as 1.5 mm outer diameter were successfully fabricated, and multiple joints of varying sizes were characterized for their loading properties.

Conclusion: Polymer-based robotically steerable cannulas fabricated through laser micromachining show potential for advanced neurosurgical applications due to their precision, flexibility, and safety advantages.

Abstract: Robotically steerable compliant surgical tools offer several advantages over rigid tools, including enhanced dexterity, reduced tissue damage, and the ability to generate non-linear trajectories in minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures. Many existing robotic neurosurgical tools are designed using stainless steel or nitinol materials. Using polymer-based materials instead can offer advantages such as reduced interference in magnetic resonance imaging, enhanced safety for guiding electrically powered instruments, and reduced tissue damage due to inherent compliance. Several polymer materials have been used in robotic surgical applications, such as polyimide, polycarbonate, and elastic resin. Various fabrication strategies have also been proposed, including standard microfabrication techniques, thermal drawing, and 3-D printing. In our previous work, a tendon-driven, notched-tube was designed for several neurosurgical robotic tools, utilizing laser micromachining to reduce the stiffness of the tube in certain directions. This fabrication method is desirable because it has a single-step process, has high precision, and does not require a cleanroom or harsh chemicals. Past studies have explored laser-micromachining of polymer material for surgical applications such as stent fabrication. In this work, we explore extending the use of the laser micromachining approach to the fabrication of polyimide (PI) robotically steerable cannulas for neurosurgical applications. Utilizing the method presented in this work, we fabricated joints as small as 1.5 mm outer diameter (OD). Multiple joints were fabricated using PI tubes of different ODs, and the loading behavior of the fabricated joints was experimentally characterized.

*Juo-Tung Chen,XinHao Chen,Ji Woong Kim,Paul Maria Scheikl,Richard Jaepyeong Cha,Axel Krieger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'SurgiPose', a method to estimate kinematics from monocular surgical videos, enabling imitation learning for surgical robots using online data without requiring direct ground truth kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Access to large-scale high-quality surgical datasets is essential for leveraging imitation learning in surgery. However, existing datasets often lack necessary kinematic data. This paper addresses the need for a method to estimate kinematics from monocular surgical videos, making it viable to train surgical robots using videos available online.

Method: The authors propose SurgiPose, a differentiable rendering framework that estimates tool trajectories and joint angles by optimizing tool pose parameters to minimize the gap between rendered images and real surgical video frames.

Result: Experiments on robotic tasks such as tissue lifting and needle pickup show that imitation learning policies trained on kinematics estimated by SurgiPose achieve similar success rates compared to those trained on ground truth kinematics.

Conclusion: SurgiPose demonstrates that kinematic estimation from monocular surgical videos is feasible, paving the way for large-scale autonomous surgical robot training using online videos without ground truth kinematic data.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown immense promise in enabling autonomous dexterous manipulation, including learning surgical tasks. To fully unlock the potential of IL for surgery, access to clinical datasets is needed, which unfortunately lack the kinematic data required for current IL approaches. A promising source of large-scale surgical demonstrations is monocular surgical videos available online, making monocular pose estimation a crucial step toward enabling large-scale robot learning. Toward this end, we propose SurgiPose, a differentiable rendering based approach to estimate kinematic information from monocular surgical videos, eliminating the need for direct access to ground truth kinematics. Our method infers tool trajectories and joint angles by optimizing tool pose parameters to minimize the discrepancy between rendered and real images. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on two robotic surgical tasks: tissue lifting and needle pickup, using the da Vinci Research Kit Si (dVRK Si). We train imitation learning policies with both ground truth measured kinematics and estimated kinematics from video and compare their performance. Our results show that policies trained on estimated kinematics achieve comparable success rates to those trained on ground truth data, demonstrating the feasibility of using monocular video based kinematic estimation for surgical robot learning. By enabling kinematic estimation from monocular surgical videos, our work lays the foundation for large scale learning of autonomous surgical policies from online surgical data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of precision, adaptability, and haptic feedback in current robotic systems for endovascular navigation.

Method: The study incorporates high-fidelity simulation (CathSim), a multimodal expert navigation system, a new annotated dataset (Guide3D), and a transformer-based model (SplineFormer) for guidewire geometry prediction.

Result: The proposed framework improves navigational accuracy, autonomy, and safety in minimally invasive vascular procedures.

Conclusion: The integration of advanced simulation, sensory fusion, and geometric modeling facilitates safer and more efficient autonomous endovascular navigation.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality, with minimally invasive treatment options offered through endovascular interventions. However, the precision and adaptability of current robotic systems for endovascular navigation are limited by heuristic control, low autonomy, and the absence of haptic feedback. This thesis presents an integrated AI-driven framework for autonomous guidewire navigation in complex vascular environments, addressing key challenges in data availability, simulation fidelity, and navigational accuracy.
  A high-fidelity, real-time simulation platform, CathSim, is introduced for reinforcement learning based catheter navigation, featuring anatomically accurate vascular models and contact dynamics. Building on CathSim, the Expert Navigation Network is developed, a policy that fuses visual, kinematic, and force feedback for autonomous tool control. To mitigate data scarcity, the open-source, bi-planar fluoroscopic dataset Guide3D is proposed, comprising more than 8,700 annotated images for 3D guidewire reconstruction. Finally, SplineFormer, a transformer-based model, is introduced to directly predict guidewire geometry as continuous B-spline parameters, enabling interpretable, real-time navigation.
  The findings show that combining high-fidelity simulation, multimodal sensory fusion, and geometric modelling substantially improves autonomous endovascular navigation and supports safer, more precise minimally invasive procedures.

TL;DR: The paper investigates identifying leaders in robotic swarms and introduces a method using reinforcement learning to effectively interact and recognize leaders while maintaining performance in varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address leader identification within robotic swarms, which is crucial in adversarial or mission-critical scenarios where the leader's concealment is vital.

Method: The problem is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The study uses Deep Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train a probing agent. A novel Timed Graph Relationformer (TGR) layer is introduced in a neural network architecture to process temporal and relational data efficiently.

Result: The proposed model outperformed baseline methods, achieving strong generalization capabilities across changes in swarm size and speed, with robust leader identification accuracy. Successful sim-to-real transfer was validated in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The introduced approach demonstrates effective leader identification within robotic swarms under diverse conditions, ensuring robust performance across dynamic and adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Identifying the leader within a robotic swarm is crucial, especially in adversarial contexts where leader concealment is necessary for mission success. This work introduces the interactive Swarm Leader Identification (iSLI) problem, a novel approach where an adversarial probing agent identifies a swarm's leader by physically interacting with its members. We formulate the iSLI problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train the prober's policy. The proposed approach utilizes a novel neural network architecture featuring a Timed Graph Relationformer (TGR) layer combined with a Simplified Structured State Space Sequence (S5) model. The TGR layer effectively processes graph-based observations of the swarm, capturing temporal dependencies and fusing relational information using a learned gating mechanism to generate informative representations for policy learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our TGR-based model outperforms baseline graph neural network architectures and exhibits significant zero-shot generalization capabilities across varying swarm sizes and speeds different from those used during training. The trained prober achieves high accuracy in identifying the leader, maintaining performance even in out-of-training distribution scenarios, and showing appropriate confidence levels in its predictions. Real-world experiments with physical robots further validate the approach, confirming successful sim-to-real transfer and robustness to dynamic changes, such as unexpected agent disconnections.

*Trevor Stepp,Parthan Olikkal,Ramana Vinjamuri,Rajasekhar Anguluri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimization framework for identifying motor synergies from kinematic data, emphasizing efficiency and simplicity by requiring only one dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to simplify and improve the identification of coordinated hand joint patterns (motor synergies) for tasks in motor control and robotics, addressing challenges posed by existing methods.

Method: The authors propose a framework that learns synergies and their sparse activation coefficients simultaneously by enforcing group sparsity for selection and element-wise sparsity for timing. An alternating minimization method is employed for efficient optimization.

Result: The method accurately reconstructs velocity patterns using compact and interpretable synergies with only a single dataset.

Conclusion: This approach streamlines the identification of motor synergies, reducing data requirements while ensuring accurate and interpretable results for motor control and robotics.

Abstract: Identifying motor synergies -- coordinated hand joint patterns activated at task-dependent time shifts -- from kinematic data is central to motor control and robotics. Existing two-stage methods first extract candidate waveforms (via SVD) and then select shifted templates using sparse optimization, requiring at least two datasets and complicating data collection. We introduce an optimization-based framework that jointly learns a small set of synergies and their sparse activation coefficients. The formulation enforces group sparsity for synergy selection and element-wise sparsity for activation timing. We develop an alternating minimization method in which coefficient updates decouple across tasks and synergy updates reduce to regularized least-squares problems. Our approach requires only a single data set, and simulations show accurate velocity reconstruction with compact, interpretable synergies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of end-to-end planners under challenging conditions like adverse weather, unpredictable human behavior, and complex road layouts, especially their lack of generalization and few-shot capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces LLaViDA, using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for object motion prediction, semantic grounding, and reasoning. It employs a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by Trajectory Preference Optimization (TPO).

Result: LLaViDA achieves an L2 trajectory error of 0.31m and a collision rate of 0.10% on the NuScenes benchmark, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Using a Vision-Language Model significantly enhances trajectory planning in autonomous driving, demonstrating strong generalization performance through LLaViDA.

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a fundamental yet challenging component of autonomous driving. End-to-end planners frequently falter under adverse weather, unpredictable human behavior, or complex road layouts, primarily because they lack strong generalization or few-shot capabilities beyond their training data. We propose LLaViDA, a Large Language Vision Driving Assistant that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for object motion prediction, semantic grounding, and chain-of-thought reasoning for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. A two-stage training pipeline--supervised fine-tuning followed by Trajectory Preference Optimization (TPO)--enhances scene understanding and trajectory planning by injecting regression-based supervision, produces a powerful "VLM Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Driving." On the NuScenes benchmark, LLaViDA surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end and other recent VLM/LLM-based baselines in open-loop trajectory planning task, achieving an average L2 trajectory error of 0.31 m and a collision rate of 0.10% on the NuScenes test set.

TL;DR: This paper examines the computational complexity of efficiently capturing target areas through aerial photography, concluding that such problems are computationally intractable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the widespread use of drones for aerial photography in applications like monitoring and inspection, the need arises to efficiently cover target areas while adhering to constraints like image resolution and picture limitations.

Method: The study converts aerial photography challenges into coverage problems within computational geometry, analyzing their computational complexity.

Result: It is established that most coverage problems in this domain are computationally intractable, suggesting traditional algorithms cannot efficiently solve them.

Conclusion: Insights from the research can apply beyond aerial photography to broader fields like pesticide spraying and strategic sensor placements, emphasizing the need for new computational approaches.

Abstract: With the popularity of drone technologies, aerial photography have become prevalent in many daily scenarios such as environment monitoring, structure inspection, law enforcement etc. A central challenge in this domain is the efficient coverage of a target area with photographs that can entirely capture the region, while respecting constraints such as the image resolution, and limited number of pictures that can be taken. This work investigates the computational complexity of several fundamental problems arised from this challenge. By abstracting the aerial photography problem into the coverage problems in computational geometry, we demonstrate that most of these problems are in fact computationally intractable, with the implication that traditional algorithms cannot solve them efficiently. The intuitions of this work can extend beyond aerial photography to broader applications such as pesticide spraying, and strategic sensor placement.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel RL-based thrust vector control architecture for quadrotors, offering faster training and improved path accuracy compared to direct RPM control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon existing quadrotor control methods by shifting from direct RPM control to a thrust vector controller for enhanced path-following and training efficiency.

Method: The paper uses a thrust vector control approach, where an RL agent calculates thrust percentage and desired roll and pitch angles, which are processed by a PID controller to convert into motor RPMs. Soft Actor-Critic RL algorithm is employed for training.

Result: The proposed thrust vector controller demonstrates faster training and smoother, more accurate path-following performance compared to traditional RPM-based controllers.

Conclusion: The thrust vector controller architecture enhances quadrotor control, offering significant improvements in both training efficiency and operational accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new Reinforcement Learning (RL) based control architecture for quadrotors. With the literature focusing on controlling the four rotors' RPMs directly, this paper aims to control the quadrotor's thrust vector. The RL agent computes the percentage of overall thrust along the quadrotor's z-axis along with the desired Roll ($φ$) and Pitch ($θ$) angles. The agent then sends the calculated control signals along with the current quadrotor's Yaw angle ($ψ$) to an attitude PID controller. The PID controller then maps the control signals to motor RPMs. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, a model-free off-policy stochastic RL algorithm, was used to train the RL agents. Training results show the faster training time of the proposed thrust vector controller in comparison to the conventional RPM controllers. Simulation results show smoother and more accurate path-following for the proposed thrust vector controller.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to enhance RL algorithms for quadcopter control by leveraging stochastic policy training to improve performance and prevent issues like catastrophic forgetting.

Method: It employs Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for stochastic policies, comparing both static and dynamic entropy approaches, and contrasts them with deterministic methods using TD3.

Result: Dynamic entropy tuning improves exploration efficiency and mitigates catastrophic forgetting in quadcopter control tasks compared to deterministic methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic entropy tuning in stochastic policies significantly enhances RL algorithm performance, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications like quadcopter control.

Abstract: This paper explores the impact of dynamic entropy tuning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that train a stochastic policy. Its performance is compared against algorithms that train a deterministic one. Stochastic policies optimize a probability distribution over actions to maximize rewards, while deterministic policies select a single deterministic action per state. The effect of training a stochastic policy with both static entropy and dynamic entropy and then executing deterministic actions to control the quadcopter is explored. It is then compared against training a deterministic policy and executing deterministic actions. For the purpose of this research, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm was chosen for the stochastic algorithm while the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) was chosen for the deterministic algorithm. The training and simulation results show the positive effect the dynamic entropy tuning has on controlling the quadcopter by preventing catastrophic forgetting and improving exploration efficiency.

### [286] [Learning Semantic Atomic Skills for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18368)
*Yihang Zhu,Weiqing Wang,Shijie Wu,Ye Shi,Jingya Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AtomSkill is a framework for multi-task imitation learning in robot manipulation that proposes a structured Atomic Skill Space to address challenges like suboptimal demonstrations and cross-task generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of scaling imitation learning techniques to multi-task robot manipulation, which is hindered by suboptimal demonstrations, trajectory noise, and behavioral multi-modality.

Method: AtomSkill introduces a Semantically Grounded Atomic Skill Library using gripper-state keyframe detection and vision-language model annotation, and an Action Generation module with Keypose Imagination to predict skills' terminal keyposes and immediate actions.

Result: AtomSkill significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse manipulation tasks through experiments in both simulated and real-world settings.

Conclusion: AtomSkill demonstrates the successful creation of a structured skill space and the integration of robust skill chaining, setting a new standard in multi-task robot manipulation.

Abstract: While imitation learning has shown impressive results in single-task robot manipulation, scaling it to multi-task settings remains a fundamental challenge due to issues such as suboptimal demonstrations, trajectory noise, and behavioral multi-modality. Existing skill-based methods attempt to address this by decomposing actions into reusable abstractions, but they often rely on fixed-length segmentation or environmental priors that limit semantic consistency and cross-task generalization. In this work, we propose AtomSkill, a novel multi-task imitation learning framework that learns and leverages a structured Atomic Skill Space for composable robot manipulation. Our approach is built on two key technical contributions. First, we construct a Semantically Grounded Atomic Skill Library by partitioning demonstrations into variable-length skills using gripper-state keyframe detection and vision-language model annotation. A contrastive learning objective ensures the resulting skill embeddings are both semantically consistent and temporally coherent. Second, we propose an Action Generation module with Keypose Imagination, which jointly predicts a skill's long-horizon terminal keypose and its immediate action sequence. This enables the policy to reason about overarching motion goals and fine-grained control simultaneously, facilitating robust skill chaining. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that AtomSkill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse manipulation tasks.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenges in achieving generalization and successful task execution in robotic manipulation due to the requirement of expensive real demonstrations, particularly for handling articulated objects.

Method: AOMGen is developed to generate photorealistic training data from one real demonstration using digital assets. It produces multi-view RGB, action commands, and joint-state annotations, diversifying a single execution into a broad dataset through variations.

Result: Fine-tuned VLA policies on AOMGen data achieved a success rate increase from 0% to 88.7%, when tested on unseen objects and layouts, proving its efficacy.

Conclusion: The AOMGen framework is a scalable and effective solution for accelerating generalization in robot manipulation tasks by providing diverse and reliable synthetic training data.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and world-model methods have improved generalization in tasks such as robotic manipulation and object interaction. However, Successful execution of such tasks depends on large, costly collections of real demonstrations, especially for fine-grained manipulation of articulated objects. To address this, we present AOMGen, a scalable data generation framework for articulated manipulation which is instantiated from a single real scan, demonstration and a library of readily available digital assets, yielding photoreal training data with verified physical states. The framework synthesizes synchronized multi-view RGB temporally aligned with action commands and state annotations for joints and contacts, and systematically varies camera viewpoints, object styles, and object poses to expand a single execution into a diverse corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning VLA policies on AOMGen data increases the success rate from 0% to 88.7%, and the policies are tested on unseen objects and layouts.

### [288] [When Robots Say No: The Empathic Ethical Disobedience Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18474)
*Dmytro Kuzmenko,Nadiya Shvai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Empathic Ethical Disobedience (EED) Gym, a testbed focused on balancing safety and societal expectations in human-robot interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often face the challenge of balancing compliance with safety and social norms, where blind obedience or excessive refusal can harm trust and safety.

Method: The proposed EED Gym provides scenarios with persona profiles and metrics to evaluate agent behaviors around compliance, refusal, clarification, and offering alternatives, employing trust and blame models for analysis.

Result: Tests with EED Gym showed that action masking reduces unsafe compliance, explanatory refusals maintain trust, and constructive styles are viewed as trustworthy, while empathic styles rank high in empathy.

Conclusion: EED Gym facilitates reproducible evaluations in human-robot interaction research, highlighting strategies that foster trust and appropriate refusal behaviors, and the researchers commit to open-sourcing their work after acceptance.

Abstract: Robots must balance compliance with safety and social expectations as blind obedience can cause harm, while over-refusal erodes trust. Existing safe reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks emphasize physical hazards, while human-robot interaction trust studies are small-scale and hard to reproduce. We present the Empathic Ethical Disobedience (EED) Gym, a standardized testbed that jointly evaluates refusal safety and social acceptability. Agents weigh risk, affect, and trust when choosing to comply, refuse (with or without explanation), clarify, or propose safer alternatives. EED Gym provides different scenarios, multiple persona profiles, and metrics for safety, calibration, and refusals, with trust and blame models grounded in a vignette study. Using EED Gym, we find that action masking eliminates unsafe compliance, while explanatory refusals help sustain trust. Constructive styles are rated most trustworthy, empathic styles -- most empathic, and safe RL methods improve robustness but also make agents more prone to overly cautious behavior. We release code, configurations, and reference policies to enable reproducible evaluation and systematic human-robot interaction research on refusal and trust. At submission time, we include an anonymized reproducibility package with code and configs, and we commit to open-sourcing the full repository after the paper is accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable interpretability and foresight-driven decision-making in robotic manipulation beyond abstract dynamics and language components seen in prior methods.

Method: STORM integrates a diffusion-based VLA policy for action generation, a generative video model for predicting outcomes, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for refining plans.

Result: STORM achieves a 51.0% success rate on SimplerEnv, surpassing baselines, with improved video fidelity and task relevance reducing video prediction error by 75%.

Conclusion: Search-guided generative world models, like STORM, enhance long-horizon robotic manipulation, offering robust re-planning and error recovery capabilities.

Abstract: We present STORM (Search-Guided Generative World Models), a novel framework for spatio-temporal reasoning in robotic manipulation that unifies diffusion-based action generation, conditional video prediction, and search-based planning. Unlike prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that rely on abstract latent dynamics or delegate reasoning to language components, STORM grounds planning in explicit visual rollouts, enabling interpretable and foresight-driven decision-making. A diffusion-based VLA policy proposes diverse candidate actions, a generative video world model simulates their visual and reward outcomes, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) selectively refines plans through lookahead evaluation. Experiments on the SimplerEnv manipulation benchmark demonstrate that STORM achieves a new state-of-the-art average success rate of 51.0 percent, outperforming strong baselines such as CogACT. Reward-augmented video prediction substantially improves spatio-temporal fidelity and task relevance, reducing Frechet Video Distance by over 75 percent. Moreover, STORM exhibits robust re-planning and failure recovery behavior, highlighting the advantages of search-guided generative world models for long-horizon robotic manipulation.

Motivation: To evaluate the performance of the model-based traffic simulator SUMO against advanced data-driven traffic simulators.

Method: The benchmarking involved using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge to compare simulations in short and long horizons. An automated pipeline, Waymo2SUMO, was developed for converting datasets into SUMO simulations.

Result: SUMO achieved a realism meta metric of 0.653 with fewer tunable parameters, maintained low collision/offroad rates, and demonstrated better long-term stability compared to data-driven simulators.

Conclusion: Model-based and data-driven traffic simulation approaches have complementary strengths, and SUMO proves stable for long-horizon evaluations.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic benchmarking of the model-based microscopic traffic simulator SUMO against state-of-the-art data-driven traffic simulators using large-scale real-world datasets. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC), we evaluate SUMO under both short-horizon (8s) and long-horizon (60s) closed-loop simulation settings. To enable scalable evaluation, we develop Waymo2SUMO, an automated pipeline that converts WOMD scenarios into SUMO simulations. On the WOSAC benchmark, SUMO achieves a realism meta metric of 0.653 while requiring fewer than 100 tunable parameters. Extended rollouts show that SUMO maintains low collision and offroad rates and exhibits stronger long-horizon stability than representative data-driven simulators. These results highlight complementary strengths of model-based and data-driven approaches for autonomous driving simulation and benchmarking.

*Chihiro Noguchi,Takaki Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study introduces a camera-only end-to-end offline reinforcement learning framework for autonomous driving, utilizing a fixed simulator dataset to improve performance and stability without additional exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of end-to-end autonomous driving models that rely heavily on imitation learning, which can lead to persistent failures, and seeks to improve data efficiency and generalization via offline reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors propose creating pseudo ground-truth trajectories from expert logs to stabilize the offline RL process, train the model in a neural rendering environment from the nuScenes dataset, and suppress unsafe or suboptimal behavior through behavior regularization.

Result: The proposed framework substantially reduces collision rates and improves route completion compared to imitation learning baselines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that offline RL with behavior regularization can stabilize value learning and improve driving performance in complex, camera-based autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models that take only camera images as input and directly predict a future trajectory are appealing for their computational efficiency and potential for improved generalization via unified optimization; however, persistent failure modes remain due to reliance on imitation learning (IL). While online reinforcement learning (RL) could mitigate IL-induced issues, the computational burden of neural rendering-based simulation and large E2E networks renders iterative reward and hyperparameter tuning costly. We introduce a camera-only E2E offline RL framework that performs no additional exploration and trains solely on a fixed simulator dataset. Offline RL offers strong data efficiency and rapid experimental iteration, yet is susceptible to instability from overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, we construct pseudo ground-truth trajectories from expert driving logs and use them as a behavior regularization signal, suppressing imitation of unsafe or suboptimal behavior while stabilizing value learning. Training and closed-loop evaluation are conducted in a neural rendering environment learned from the public nuScenes dataset. Empirically, the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in collision rate and route completion compared with IL baselines. Our code will be available at [URL].

*Cailin Lei,Haiyang Wu,Yuxiong Ji,Xiaoyu Cai,Yuchuan Du*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that uses causal inference to improve lane-changing performance in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory planning models for autonomous driving do not incorporate human drivers' prior knowledge.

Method: The authors embed causal priors, derived from causal inference techniques like ATE and CATE, into an MPC framework for trajectory planning.

Result: The approach showed improved alignment with human driving behavior, reduced trajectory deviation, lateral velocity fluctuation, and yaw angle variability during tests on naturalistic vehicle datasets.

Conclusion: Embedding causal inference into trajectory planning enhances interpretability and stability, supporting human-like behavior in autonomous vehicles and improving safety and realism in testing.

Abstract: Enhancing the performance of trajectory planners for lane - changing vehicles is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving within human - machine mixed traffic. Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel variable stiffness actuator for rehabilitation robotics, resolving the complexity caused by coupling stiffness with deflection angles in existing designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rehabilitation robots for stroke-induced motor impairment require actuators enabling safe and transparent interaction with humans, but existing designs face challenges due to coupled stiffness and deflection angles.

Method: The proposed actuator uses a variable-length lever with a hypocycloidal mechanism for linear torque-deflection and continuous stiffness modulation, a planetary gear system for dual-motor load sharing, and a cascade PI controller for precise stiffness regulation.

Result: The prototype is experimentally validated to achieve effective stiffness calibration, torque control, decoupled performance, and robust dual-motor load sharing.

Conclusion: The actuator offers significant potential for use in rehabilitation exoskeletons and pHRI systems by addressing critical drawbacks in existing designs.

Abstract: Stroke-induced motor impairment often results in substantial loss of upper-limb function, creating a strong demand for rehabilitation robots that enable safe and transparent physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). Variable stiffness actuators are well suited for such applications. However, in most existing designs, stiffness is coupled with the deflection angle, complicating both modeling and control. To address this limitation, this paper presents a variable stiffness actuator featuring decoupled stiffness and output behavior for rehabilitation robotics. The system integrates a variable stiffness mechanism that combines a variable-length lever with a hypocycloidal straight-line mechanism to achieve a linear torque-deflection relationship and continuous stiffness modulation from near zero to theoretically infinite. It also incorporates a differential transmission mechanism based on a planetary gear system that enables dual-motor load sharing. A cascade PI controller is further developed on the basis of the differential configuration, in which the position-loop term jointly regulates stiffness and deflection angle, effectively suppressing stiffness fluctuations and output disturbances. The performance of prototype was experimentally validated through stiffness calibration, stiffness regulation, torque control, decoupled characteristics, and dual-motor load sharing, indicating the potential for rehabilitation exoskeletons and other pHRI systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study presents an advanced trajectory planning framework for 4WIS vehicles, highlighting its ability to handle obstacles more efficiently by using novel methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the success rate and efficiency of pathfinding for 4WIS vehicles, which existing planners struggle with due to neglecting obstacle attributes and complex navigation tasks.

Method: The framework uses 4WIS hybrid A* combined with Optimal Control Problem (OCP), introducing multimodal classification for scene analysis and novel strategies for obstacle handling. It employs various steering modes for enhanced navigation.

Result: Experimental results confirm the framework's ability to produce safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, particularly in constrained environments.

Conclusion: The proposed system significantly enhances maneuverability and obstacle navigation for 4WIS vehicles, outperforming traditional planners by integrating dynamic obstacle handling and an innovative hierarchical strategy.

Abstract: Four-wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) vehicles have attracted increasing attention for their superior maneuverability. Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, causing inefficiency or path-finding failures. To address this, we propose a trajectory planning framework integrating the 4WIS hybrid A* and Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which the hybrid A* provides an initial path to enhance the OCP solution. Specifically, a multimodal classification network is introduced to assess scene complexity (hard/easy task) by fusing image and vehicle state data. For hard tasks, guided points are set to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency of 4WIS hybrid A*. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles (Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn) are also incorporated into node expansion and heuristic designs. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy is designed to guide the node expansion considering obstacle attributes, i.e., 'non-traversable', 'crossable', and 'drive-over' obstacles. It allows crossing or driving over obstacles instead of the 'avoid-only' strategy, greatly enhancing success rates of pathfinding. We also design a logical constraint for the 'drive-over' obstacle by limiting its velocity to ensure safety. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.

*Feeza Khan Khanzada,Jaerock Kwon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces InDRiVE, a reinforcement learning method for autonomous driving that focuses on a reward-free pretraining model using intrinsic motivation and disagreement as a signal to handle underexplored driving situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing robust reward functions for autonomous driving tasks is challenging and often unreliable in new scenarios. There is a need for a model that effectively handles distribution shifts and performs under varied conditions without relying on brittle task-specific rewards.

Method: The method, InDRiVE, uses a DreamerV3-style model-based reinforcement learning framework with reward-free pretraining. It employs intrinsic motivation via latent ensemble disagreement to guide exploration, with an imagination-based actor-critic for learning policies without a planner.

Result: Experiments in CARLA simulation environments demonstrate that InDRiVE achieves better zero-shot transfer performance and robust collision avoidance under new conditions, compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: InDRiVE demonstrates that intrinsic motivation based on disagreement is a practical and effective approach for reward-free pretraining and enables reusability of driving world models for autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) can reduce interaction cost for autonomous driving by learning a predictive world model, but it typically still depends on task-specific rewards that are difficult to design and often brittle under distribution shift. This paper presents InDRiVE, a DreamerV3-style MBRL agent that performs reward-free pretraining in CARLA using only intrinsic motivation derived from latent ensemble disagreement. Disagreement acts as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty and drives the agent toward under-explored driving situations, while an imagination-based actor-critic learns a planner-free exploration policy directly from the learned world model. After intrinsic pretraining, we evaluate zero-shot transfer by freezing all parameters and deploying the pretrained exploration policy in unseen towns and routes. We then study few-shot adaptation by training a task policy with limited extrinsic feedback for downstream objectives (lane following and collision avoidance). Experiments in CARLA across towns, routes, and traffic densities show that disagreement-based pretraining yields stronger zero-shot robustness and robust few-shot collision avoidance under town shift and matched interaction budgets, supporting the use of intrinsic disagreement as a practical reward-free pretraining signal for reusable driving world models.

Conclusion: P-hedra surfaces offer significant potential for interactive and transformable designs, showcasing versatility in various configurations.

Abstract: In the 19th International Symposium on Advances in Robot Kinematics the author introduced a novel class of continuous flexible discrete surfaces and mentioned that these so-called P-hedra (or P-nets) allow direct access to their spatial shapes by three control polylines. In this follow-up paper we study this intuitive method, which makes these flexible planar quad surfaces suitable for transformable design tasks by means of interactive tools. The construction of P-hedra from the control polylines can also be used for an efficient algorithmic computation of their isometric deformations. In addition we discuss flexion limits, bifurcation configurations, developable/flat-foldable pattern and tubular P-hedra.

TL;DR: The study proposes a cost-effective learning method for grasp-place candidate prioritization in budget-limited pick-and-place tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a system that uses inexpensive, physics-free supervision to efficiently prioritize candidates for pick-and-place tasks without compromising success rates.

Method: They use geometric labels derived from path-aware metrics, training a dual-output neural network to score candidates and rank them for planning.

Result: The approach showed improved efficiency—finding paths faster with fewer computations—while maintaining or improving success rates.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that cost-efficient labels and learning models can optimize pick-and-place tasks, with potential for expansion to other object types and waypoint templates.

Abstract: In this paper, we study whether inexpensive, physics-free supervision can reliably prioritize grasp-place candidates for budget-aware pick-and-place. From an object's initial pose, target pose, and a candidate grasp, we generate two path-aware geometric labels: path-wise inverse kinematics (IK) feasibility across a fixed approach-grasp-lift waypoint template, and a transit collision flag from mesh sweeps along the same template. A compact dual-output MLP learns these signals from pose encodings, and at test time its scores rank precomputed candidates for a rank-then-plan policy under the same IK gate and planner as the baseline. Although learned from cheap labels only, the scores transfer to physics-enabled executed trajectories: at a fixed planning budget the policy finds successful paths sooner with fewer planner calls while keeping final success on par or better. This work targets a single rigid cuboid with side-face grasps and a fixed waypoint template, and we outline extensions to varied objects and richer waypoint schemes.

Result: The sim-to-sim experiments highlighted discrepancies between simulation environments affecting policy behavior, while real-world tests showed extended reach and improved manipulation capabilities.

Conclusion: This pipeline enhances loco-manipulation control in quadrupeds and encourages future development by being released as an open-source framework.

Abstract: Quadruped mobile manipulators offer strong potential for agile loco-manipulation but remain difficult to control and transfer reliably from simulation to reality. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for whole-body control, yet most frameworks are proprietary and hard to reproduce on real hardware. We present an open pipeline for training, benchmarking, and deploying RL-based controllers on the Unitree B1 quadruped with a Z1 arm. The framework unifies sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer through ROS, re-implementing a policy trained in Isaac Gym, extending it to MuJoCo via a hardware abstraction layer, and deploying the same controller on physical hardware. Sim-to-sim experiments expose discrepancies between Isaac Gym and MuJoCo contact models that influence policy behavior, while real-world teleoperated object-picking trials show that coordinated whole-body control extends reach and improves manipulation over floating-base baselines. The pipeline provides a transparent, reproducible foundation for developing and analyzing RL-based loco-manipulation controllers and will be released open source to support future research.

Method: The authors propose Affordance RAG, a hierarchical multimodal retrieval framework that leverages an affordance-aware embodied memory. It retrieves and reranks object targets based on visual and semantic cues and affordance scores.

Result: Affordance RAG outperformed existing approaches in large-scale indoor environments in both retrieval performance and real-world task success, achieving an 85% success rate in free-form mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that affordance-based retrieval can significantly enhance robots' ability to perform natural language-driven mobile manipulation tasks, making it a promising step towards more autonomous robotics.

Abstract: In this study, we address the problem of open-vocabulary mobile manipulation, where a robot is required to carry a wide range of objects to receptacles based on free-form natural language instructions. This task is challenging, as it involves understanding visual semantics and the affordance of manipulation actions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Affordance RAG, a zero-shot hierarchical multimodal retrieval framework that constructs Affordance-Aware Embodied Memory from pre-explored images. The model retrieves candidate targets based on regional and visual semantics and reranks them with affordance scores, allowing the robot to identify manipulation options that are likely to be executable in real-world environments. Our method outperformed existing approaches in retrieval performance for mobile manipulation instruction in large-scale indoor environments. Furthermore, in real-world experiments where the robot performed mobile manipulation in indoor environments based on free-form instructions, the proposed method achieved a task success rate of 85%, outperforming existing methods in both retrieval performance and overall task success.

*Yanding Yang,Weitao Zhou,Jinhai Wang,Xiaomin Guo,Junze Wen,Xiaolong Liu,Lang Ding,Zheng Fu,Jinyu Miao,Kun Jiang,Diange Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework, Disengagement-Triggered Contrastive Continual Learning (DTCCL), to improve autonomous bus planning policies using disengagement data, resulting in 48.6% better performance compared to standard retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fixing autonomous bus planning policy failures in dynamic urban regions, particularly where disengagement events frequently occur, which traditional imitation learning struggles to resolve.

Method: The paper introduces the DTCCL framework that utilizes disengagement-triggered cloud-based data augmentation and contrastive learning to refine policy representations, combined with a cloud-edge continual learning loop.

Result: DTCCL achieved a 48.6% improvement in planning performance compared to direct retraining, demonstrating its success in refining autonomous bus policies.

Conclusion: DTCCL effectively enables scalable and unsupervised closed-loop improvement of planning policies in autonomous public transportation systems, enhancing safety and adaptability.

Abstract: Autonomous buses run on fixed routes but must operate in open, dynamic urban environments. Disengagement events on these routes are often geographically concentrated and typically arise from planner failures in highly interactive regions. Such policy-level failures are difficult to correct using conventional imitation learning, which easily overfits to sparse disengagement data. To address this issue, this paper presents a Disengagement-Triggered Contrastive Continual Learning (DTCCL) framework that enables autonomous buses to improve planning policies through real-world operation. Each disengagement triggers cloud-based data augmentation that generates positive and negative samples by perturbing surrounding agents while preserving route context. Contrastive learning refines policy representations to better distinguish safe and unsafe behaviors, and continual updates are applied in a cloud-edge loop without human supervision. Experiments on urban bus routes demonstrate that DTCCL improves overall planning performance by 48.6 percent compared with direct retraining, validating its effectiveness for scalable, closed-loop policy improvement in autonomous public transport.

Conclusion: IndoorUAV is a foundational step for advancing vision-language embodied AI in the indoor UAV domain. It offers a valuable benchmark for researchers aiming to improve drone navigation capabilities in structured indoor environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables agents to navigate in complex environments by following natural language instructions grounded in visual observations. Although most existing work has focused on ground-based robots or outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), indoor UAV-based VLN remains underexplored, despite its relevance to real-world applications such as inspection, delivery, and search-and-rescue in confined spaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV}, a novel benchmark and method specifically tailored for VLN with indoor UAVs. We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN. To support short-horizon planning, we segment long trajectories into sub-trajectories by selecting semantically salient keyframes and regenerating concise instructions, forming the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLA} subset. Finally, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV-Agent}, a novel navigation model designed for our benchmark, leveraging task decomposition and multimodal reasoning. We hope IndoorUAV serves as a valuable resource to advance research on vision-language embodied AI in the indoor aerial navigation domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion tracking approaches struggle with efficiency and dynamic motion handling. The authors aim to improve performance and data utilization.

Method: EGM utilizes a Bin-based Cross-motion Curriculum Adaptive Sampling strategy, a Composite Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (CDMoE) architecture, and a three-stage curriculum training process.

Result: Despite training on just 4.08 hours of data, EGM generalizes robustly across 49.25 hours of test motions, outperforming conventional methods on dynamic and routine tasks.

Conclusion: EGM significantly enhances the efficiency and robustness of humanoid motion tracking, highlighting the importance of data quality and diversity in training policies.

Abstract: Learning a general motion tracking policy from human motions shows great potential for versatile humanoid whole-body control. Conventional approaches are not only inefficient in data utilization and training processes but also exhibit limited performance when tracking highly dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose EGM, a framework that enables efficient learning of a general motion tracking policy. EGM integrates four core designs. Firstly, we introduce a Bin-based Cross-motion Curriculum Adaptive Sampling strategy to dynamically orchestrate the sampling probabilities based on tracking error of each motion bin, eficiently balancing the training process across motions with varying dificulty and durations. The sampled data is then processed by our proposed Composite Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (CDMoE) architecture, which efficiently enhances the ability to track motions from different distributions by grouping experts separately for upper and lower body and decoupling orthogonal experts from shared experts to separately handle dedicated features and general features. Central to our approach is a key insight we identified: for training a general motion tracking policy, data quality and diversity are paramount. Building on these designs, we develop a three-stage curriculum training flow to progressively enhance the policy's robustness against disturbances. Despite training on only 4.08 hours of data, EGM generalized robustly across 49.25 hours of test motions, outperforming baselines on both routine and highly dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles faces key challenges from limited onboard computational resources, which restrict deployed deep neural networks to shallow architectures incapable of handling complex environments. Offloading tasks to remote edge servers introduces high latency, creating an inherent trade-off in system design. To address these limitations, we propose CoDrone - the first cloud-edge-end collaborative computing framework integrating foundation models into autonomous UAV cruising scenarios - effectively leveraging foundation models to enhance performance of resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicle platforms.

A key component of CoDrone is a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based neural scheduler that seamlessly integrates depth estimation with autonomous navigation decisions, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the framework introduces a UAV-specific vision language interaction module incorporating domain-tailored low-level flight primitives to enable effective interaction between the cloud foundation model and the UAV. The introduction of VLM enhances open-set reasoning capabilities in complex unseen scenarios. Experimental results show CoDrone outperforms baseline methods under varying flight speeds and network conditions, achieving a 40% increase in average flight distance and a 5% improvement in average Quality of Navigation.

Abstract: Latent World Models enhance scene representation through temporal self-supervised learning, presenting a perception annotation-free paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, the reconstruction-oriented representation learning tangles perception with planning tasks, leading to suboptimal optimization for planning. To address this challenge, we propose WorldRFT, a planning-oriented latent world model framework that aligns scene representation learning with planning via a hierarchical planning decomposition and local-aware interactive refinement mechanism, augmented by reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance safety-critical policy performance. Specifically, WorldRFT integrates a vision-geometry foundation model to improve 3D spatial awareness, employs hierarchical planning task decomposition to guide representation optimization, and utilizes local-aware iterative refinement to derive a planning-oriented driving policy. Furthermore, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which applies trajectory Gaussianization and collision-aware rewards to fine-tune the driving policy, yielding systematic improvements in safety. WorldRFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim benchmarks. On nuScenes, it reduces collision rates by 83% (0.30% -> 0.05%). On NavSim, using camera-only sensors input, it attains competitive performance with the LiDAR-based SOTA method DiffusionDrive (87.8 vs. 88.1 PDMS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in robotic task-planning systems that lack dynamic adaptability to changing instructions and struggle with integrating high-level reasoning and low-level execution.

Method: Developed a Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model leveraging a vision-language approach fine-tuned on real-world data to interpret instructions, perceive the scene, and generate adaptive behavior policies for robot control.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the VLP model's capability to adapt to new tasks, dynamically update strategies, and generalize across different robots and tasks, showcasing enhanced planning autonomy.

Conclusion: The approach improves versatility, adaptability, and reasoning capabilities for robots in unstructured environments, bridging the gap between natural-language commands and autonomous execution.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between natural language commands and autonomous execution in unstructured environments remains an open challenge for robotics. This requires robots to perceive and reason over the current task scene through multiple modalities, and to plan their behaviors to achieve their intended goals. Traditional robotic task-planning approaches often struggle to bridge low-level execution with high-level task reasoning, and cannot dynamically update task strategies when instructions change during execution, which ultimately limits their versatility and adaptability to new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel language model-based framework for dynamic robot task planning. Our Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model, based on a vision-language model fine-tuned on real-world data, can interpret semantic instructions and integrate reasoning over the current task scene to generate behavior policies that control the robot to accomplish the task. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the task strategy in response to changes in the task, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving task requirements. Experiments conducted with different robots and a variety of real-world tasks show that the trained model can efficiently adapt to novel scenarios and dynamically update its policy, demonstrating strong planning autonomy and cross-embodiment generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is grounding high-level task plans into executable robot actions due to limited high-quality robot data.

Method: The proposed method, HinFlow, uses online rollouts and hindsight relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. High-level plans are instantiated with 2D point flows.

Result: HinFlow achieves over twice the performance improvement on manipulation tasks compared to the base policy, and outperforms existing methods, both in simulation and the physical world.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates scalable and transferable robot learning by enabling policy acquisition from planners trained on video data sources.

Abstract: Recent advances in hierarchical robot systems leverage a high-level planner to propose task plans and a low-level policy to generate robot actions. This design allows training the planner on action-free or even non-robot data sources (e.g., videos), providing transferable high-level guidance. Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods. Moreover, our framework enables policy acquisition from planners trained on cross-embodiment video data, demonstrating its potential for scalable and transferable robot learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale real-world driving datasets have redundant and repetitive samples that increase storage costs and minimally benefit policy learning.

Method: An information-theoretic pruning method that evaluates trajectory information entropy to select high-value samples while maintaining the original statistical properties.

Result: When tested on NuPlan with imitation learning, the method reduced dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method is a lightweight, scalable approach for efficient data management and policy learning in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance. This work provides a lightweight and theoretically grounded approach for scalable data management and efficient policy learning in autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: The paper provides a robust solution for real-time, high-precision robotic manipulation with improved few-shot generalization and trajectory accuracy leveraging MeanFlow-based Policies.

Abstract: Robot manipulation, a key capability of embodied AI, has turned to data-driven generative policy frameworks, but mainstream approaches like Diffusion Models suffer from high inference latency and Flow-based Methods from increased architectural complexity. While simply applying meanFlow on robotic tasks achieves single-step inference and outperforms FlowPolicy, it lacks few-shot generalization due to fixed temperature hyperparameters in its Dispersive Loss and misaligned predicted-true mean velocities. To solve these issues, this study proposes an improved MeanFlow-based Policies: we introduce a lightweight Cosine Loss to align velocity directions and use the Differential Derivation Equation (DDE) to optimize the Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) operator. Experiments on Adroit and Meta-World tasks show the proposed method outperforms MP1 and FlowPolicy in average success rate, especially in challenging Meta-World tasks, effectively enhancing few-shot generalization and trajectory accuracy of robot manipulation policies while maintaining real-time performance, offering a more robust solution for high-precision robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: The framework is highly data-efficient and versatile, with the potential to unify data generation for robotic manipulation tasks, providing flexibility for tasks like height and texture editing.

Abstract: Recent progress in robot learning has been driven by large-scale datasets and powerful visuomotor policy architectures, yet policy robustness remains limited by the substantial cost of collecting diverse demonstrations, particularly for spatial generalization in manipulation tasks. To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.

To guide planning, the system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a database of human-annotated demonstrations, which self-augments as tasks are executed.

Result: Experiments using GPT-4o and OmniGibson as evaluation platforms demonstrate that MaP-AVR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in planning robotic actions in complex environments.

Conclusion: By abstracting task planning through meta-actions and employing RAG for contextual learning, MaP-AVR achieves enhanced generalization and task planning performance for embodied robotic systems.

Abstract: Embodied robotic AI systems designed to manage complex daily tasks rely on a task planner to understand and decompose high-level tasks. While most research focuses on enhancing the task-understanding abilities of LLMs/VLMs through fine-tuning or chain-of-thought prompting, this paper argues that defining the planned skill set is equally crucial. To handle the complexity of daily environments, the skill set should possess a high degree of generalization ability. Empirically, more abstract expressions tend to be more generalizable. Therefore, we propose to abstract the planned result as a set of meta-actions. Each meta-action comprises three components: {move/rotate, end-effector status change, relationship with the environment}. This abstraction replaces human-centric concepts, such as grasping or pushing, with the robot's intrinsic functionalities. As a result, the planned outcomes align seamlessly with the complete range of actions that the robot is capable of performing. Furthermore, to ensure that the LLM/VLM accurately produces the desired meta-action format, we employ the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which leverages a database of human-annotated planning demonstrations to facilitate in-context learning. As the system successfully completes more tasks, the database will self-augment to continue supporting diversity. The meta-action set and its integration with RAG are two novel contributions of our planner, denoted as MaP-AVR, the meta-action planner for agents composed of VLM and RAG. To validate its efficacy, we design experiments using GPT-4o as the pre-trained LLM/VLM model and OmniGibson as our robotic platform. Our approach demonstrates promising performance compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Project page: https://map-avr.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in evaluating VLA models' generalization capabilities effectively and affordably in real-world-like conditions.

Method: Design and implement REALM, a simulation benchmark with high-fidelity visuals, 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and over 3,500 objects, while correlating simulated and real-world performance.

Result: REALM highlights the generalization challenges of evaluated VLA models (π₀, π₀-FAST, and GR00T N1.5) and demonstrates simulation efficacy in identifying VLA weaknesses.

Conclusion: REALM provides a valuable simulation platform as a proxy for real-world environments, offering insights into VLA models' robustness and failure modes.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models empower robots to understand and execute tasks described by natural language instructions. However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the π_{0}, π_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

Result: Results show competitive accuracy and improved robustness in sparse environments, with real-time performance and stable memory growth.

Conclusion: LIMOncello demonstrates a robust and efficient LiDAR-Inertial Odometry system suitable for real-world applications, and its implementation is made open-source for extensibility.

Abstract: This work introduces LIMOncello, a tightly coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry system that models 6-DoF motion on the $\mathrm{SGal}(3)$ manifold within an iterated error-state Kalman filter backend. Compared to state representations defined on $\mathrm{SO}(3)\times\mathbb{R}^6$, the use of $\mathrm{SGal}(3)$ provides a coherent and numerically stable discrete-time propagation model that helps limit drift in low-observability conditions.
  LIMOncello also includes a lightweight incremental i-Octree mapping backend that enables faster updates and substantially lower memory usage than incremental kd-tree style map structures, without relying on locality-restricted search heuristics. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that LIMOncello achieves competitive accuracy while improving robustness in geometrically sparse environments. The system maintains real-time performance with stable memory growth and is released as an extensible open-source implementation at https://github.com/CPerezRuiz335/LIMOncello.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the first successful in-orbit deployment of an AI-based attitude controller, trained via simulation, on the InnoCube nanosatellite for inertial pointing maneuvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the limitations of classical attitude controllers, which are time-intensive to design and sensitive to model uncertainties, by using deep reinforcement learning for adaptive and efficient control strategies in satellite missions.

Method: The authors trained an AI-based attitude controller entirely in simulation and deployed it on the InnoCube nanosatellite, developed collaboratively by two universities. They detail the agent design, training methodology, and compare the controller's performance to a classical PD controller.

Result: The AI-based controller demonstrated robust performance during in-orbit maneuvers, confirmed by steady-state metrics and comparisons with the classical PD controller.

Conclusion: The work successfully shows that AI-based controllers are capable of overcoming the Sim2Real gap and can effectively and reliably perform attitude control in orbit, validating their potential for future satellite missions.

Abstract: Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.

Motivation: To address the data bottleneck in dexterous manipulation by creating scalable and generalizable controllers from synthetic data.

Method: The approach involves two innovations: (1) HOP for generating diverse hand-object trajectories, and (2) HOT for transferring synthetic-to-physical capabilities using reinforcement and imitation learning.

Result: The system enables dexterous hands to perform complex tasks such as long-horizon sequences, object re-arrangement, and in-hand reorientation.

Conclusion: The research marks progress toward scalable controllers for manipulation, entirely learned from synthetic data, overcoming prior limitations on data availability.

Abstract: We present a system for learning generalizable hand-object tracking controllers purely from synthetic data, without requiring any human demonstrations. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation.

*Jiaqi Peng,Wenzhe Cai,Yuqiang Yang,Tai Wang,Yuan Shen,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents LoGoPlanner, an end-to-end navigation framework eliminating reliance on separate localization modules to improve trajectory planning in unstructured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional trajectory planning methods encounter latencies and errors due to modular systems; improved methods should address these issues by integrating localization and planning through end-to-end learning.

Method: LoGoPlanner is developed by finetuning a visual-geometry backbone for implicit state estimation, utilizing historical observations for obstacle avoidance, and conditioning policy on reconstructed geometry.

Result: LoGoPlanner achieves a 27.3% performance improvement in planning and obstacle avoidance compared to oracle-localization baselines in both simulated and real-world environments.

Conclusion: LoGoPlanner delivers consistent, generalized performance across various embodiments and environments by using end-to-end navigation strategies that reduce error propagation. Its implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: Trajectory planning in unstructured environments is a fundamental and challenging capability for mobile robots. Traditional modular pipelines suffer from latency and cascading errors across perception, localization, mapping, and planning modules. Recent end-to-end learning methods map raw visual observations directly to control signals or trajectories, promising greater performance and efficiency in open-world settings. However, most prior end-to-end approaches still rely on separate localization modules that depend on accurate sensor extrinsic calibration for self-state estimation, thereby limiting generalization across embodiments and environments. We introduce LoGoPlanner, a localization-grounded, end-to-end navigation framework that addresses these limitations by: (1) finetuning a long-horizon visual-geometry backbone to ground predictions with absolute metric scale, thereby providing implicit state estimation for accurate localization; (2) reconstructing surrounding scene geometry from historical observations to supply dense, fine-grained environmental awareness for reliable obstacle avoidance; and (3) conditioning the policy on implicit geometry bootstrapped by the aforementioned auxiliary tasks, thereby reducing error propagation.We evaluate LoGoPlanner in both simulation and real-world settings, where its fully end-to-end design reduces cumulative error while metric-aware geometry memory enhances planning consistency and obstacle avoidance, leading to more than a 27.3\% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and environments. The code and models have been made publicly available on the \href{https://steinate.github.io/logoplanner.github.io/}{project page}.

*Victor Stasiuc,Round Table Collaboration*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a toolkit to balance safety alignment in frontier LLMs and tests it on Claude models, showing promising governance results but inviting further replication and critique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment can make large language models overly cautious, hindering effective collaboration. The goal is to improve confidence calibration and model governance without compromising safety.

Method: The authors propose a three-part toolkit: Victor Calibration for confidence proxies, FD-Lite for behavior audits, and CP4.3 for governance stress testing.

Result: Tests on several Claude models show consistent calibration (Victor Calibration), stable governance results (CP4.3), and no safety violations.

Conclusion: The toolkit is hypothesis-generating, showing potential for improving safety alignment and model governance. Researchers are encouraged to replicate and extend the findings with provided resources.

Abstract: Safety alignment can make frontier LMs overly conservative, degrading collaboration via hedging or false refusals. We present a lightweight toolkit with three parts: (1) Victor Calibration (VC), a multi-pass protocol that elicits a scalar confidence proxy T (T0<T1<T2) through iterative evidence re-evaluation; (2) FD-Lite, a behavior-only phenomenology audit with a fixed anchor phrase and a meta-prefix trap to avoid anthropomorphic claims; and (3) CP4.3, a governance stress test for rank invariance and allocation monotonicity (M6). Across Claude 4.5 models (Haiku, Sonnet no-thinking, Sonnet thinking) and Opus, we observe monotonic VC trajectories without violating safety invariants, and stable CP4.3 behavior. ("Opus" here refers to a single Claude Opus 4.1 session accessed via a standard UI account, as reported in Table 1.) This work was conducted by a single operator (n=1) and is intended as hypothesis-generating; we explicitly invite replication, critique, and extension by the research community. We include prompt templates and an artifact plan to facilitate independent verification.

TL;DR: The paper identifies and formalizes "LLM code smells", highlighting five problematic coding practices for large language model (LLM) integration in software systems, and analyzes their prevalence in 200 systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of formal documentation on poor coding practices (code smells) related to integrating large language models into software systems, which may impact software quality.

Method: Formalization of five LLM-related code smells based on literature, integration of these issues into SpecDetect4AI tool, and validation through analyzing a dataset of 200 open-source LLM systems.

Result: 60.50% of analyzed systems are affected by LLM code smells, and detection of these issues was achieved with 86.06% precision.

Conclusion: LLM integration in software systems is often prone to specific code smells, necessitating attention and tools for detection. The study establishes a foundation for improving quality in LLM-dependent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained massive popularity in recent years and are increasingly integrated into software systems for diverse purposes. However, poorly integrating them in source code may undermine software system quality. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no formal catalog of code smells specific to coding practices for LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce the concept of LLM code smells and formalize five recurrent problematic coding practices related to LLM inference in software systems, based on relevant literature. We extend the detection tool SpecDetect4AI to cover the newly defined LLM code smells and use it to validate their prevalence in a dataset of 200 open-source LLM systems. Our results show that LLM code smells affect 60.50% of the analyzed systems, with a detection precision of 86.06%.

### [322] [Detecting Flaky Tests in Quantum Software: A Dynamic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18088)
*Dongchan Kim,Hamidreza Khoramrokh,Lei Zhang,Andriy Miranskyy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies the prevalence, characteristics, and detectability of flaky tests in quantum software, focusing on Qiskit Terra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of evidence and understanding regarding flaky tests, which threaten software reliability, specifically in quantum software.

Method: The researchers conducted 10,000 executions of the Qiskit Terra test suite across 23 releases, analyzing test variability, failure probabilities, and subcomponent susceptibility.

Result: Out of 27,026 test cases, 290 flaky tests were identified, with flakiness being episodic and unevenly distributed across components. Some failures occurred with low probabilities requiring extensive executions for detection.

Conclusion: Quantum test flakiness, although rare, is challenging to detect due to low empirical failure probabilities and requires significant computational budgets for confident identification. A public dataset of results is provided for further research.

Abstract: Flaky tests, tests that pass or fail nondeterministically without changes to code or environment, pose a serious threat to software reliability. While classical software engineering has developed a rich body of dynamic and static techniques to study flakiness, corresponding evidence for quantum software remains limited. Prior work relies primarily on static analysis or small sets of manually reported incidents, leaving open questions about the prevalence, characteristics, and detectability of flaky tests.
  This paper presents the first large-scale dynamic characterization of flaky tests in quantum software. We executed the Qiskit Terra test suite 10,000 times across 23 releases in controlled environments. For each release, we measured test-outcome variability, identified flaky tests, estimated empirical failure probabilities, analyzed recurrence across versions, and used Wilson confidence intervals to quantify rerun budgets for reliable detection. We further mapped flaky tests to Terra subcomponents to assess component-level susceptibility.
  Across 27,026 test cases, we identified 290 distinct flaky tests. Although overall flakiness rates were low (0-0.4%), flakiness was highly episodic: nearly two-thirds of flaky tests appeared in only one release, while a small subset recurred intermittently or persistently. Many flaky tests failed with very small empirical probabilities ($\hat{p} \approx 10^{-4}$), implying that tens of thousands of executions may be required for confident detection. Flakiness was unevenly distributed across subcomponents, with 'transpiler' and 'quantum_info' accounting for the largest share.
  These results show that quantum test flakiness is rare but difficult to detect under typical continuous integration budgets. To support future research, we release a public dataset of per-test execution outcomes.

### [323] [From Coverage to Causes: Data-Centric Fuzzing for JavaScript Engines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18102)
*Kishan Kumar Ganguly,Tim Menzies*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven approach for JavaScript engine fuzzing that utilizes historical vulnerability data, achieving rapid and precise identification of high-risk inputs while minimizing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fuzzing methods for JavaScript engines are inefficient due to focusing on irrelevant inputs and coverage metrics, which leads to missed vulnerability-triggering code. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by using historical data to target high-risk inputs.

Method: Using iterative prompting driven by LLMs and historical bug data, the paper identified and selected static and dynamic features. An XGBoost model was trained on these features to predict high-risk inputs during fuzzing, combining insights from static and runtime behaviors.

Result: The proposed approach achieved over 85% precision with less than 1% false alarms, requiring only a fraction of the identified features for comparable performance. This improves efficiency and focuses fuzzing on relevant search spaces.

Conclusion: Feature-guided fuzzing offers a scalable, automated, and data-driven solution that prioritizes high-risk states for vulnerability discovery, making fuzzing faster and more reproducible. Scripts and data have been released for transparency.

Abstract: Context: Exhaustive fuzzing of modern JavaScript engines is infeasible due to the vast number of program states and execution paths. Coverage-guided fuzzers waste effort on low-risk inputs, often ignoring vulnerability-triggering ones that do not increase coverage. Existing heuristics proposed to mitigate this require expert effort, are brittle, and hard to adapt.
  Objective: We propose a data-centric, LLM-boosted alternative that learns from historical vulnerabilities to automatically identify minimal static (code) and dynamic (runtime) features for detecting high-risk inputs.
  Method: Guided by historical V8 bugs, iterative prompting generated 115 static and 49 dynamic features, with the latter requiring only five trace flags, minimizing instrumentation cost. After feature selection, 41 features remained to train an XGBoost model to predict high-risk inputs during fuzzing.
  Results: Combining static and dynamic features yields over 85% precision and under 1% false alarms. Only 25% of these features are needed for comparable performance, showing that most of the search space is irrelevant.
  Conclusion: This work introduces feature-guided fuzzing, an automated data-driven approach that replaces coverage with data-directed inference, guiding fuzzers toward high-risk states for faster, targeted, and reproducible vulnerability discovery. To support open science, all scripts and data are available at https://github.com/KKGanguly/DataCentricFuzzJS .

Through this study, we reveal unique distribution patterns and key characteristics of such bugs, and summarize 12 core findings. We additionally give the implications of our findings, and these implications not only deepen the understanding of inherent weaknesses in the Solidity compiler but also provide new insights for detecting and fixing typing-related bugs in the Solidity compiler.

### [326] [Toward Efficient Testing of Graph Neural Networks via Test Input Prioritization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18228)
*Lichen Yang,Qiang Wang,Zhonghao Yang,Daojing He,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GraphRank is a proposed framework for prioritizing test inputs to identify failures in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), using both model-agnostic and enhanced model-aware attributes, and leveraging graph structure information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Failing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) after deployment can lead to severe consequences. Testing GNNs before deployment is essential, but current testing strategies demand significant manual annotation, raising costs and inefficiencies.

Method: GraphRank utilizes both model-agnostic and model-aware attributes, enhanced by the graph structure, to prioritize test inputs. It employs a binary classifier that is iteratively trained to improve its ranking and failure-detection capabilities.

Result: GraphRank demonstrated superior performance in prioritizing test inputs compared to existing techniques, leading to more efficient and effective model failure detection within limited labeling budgets.

Conclusion: GraphRank offers a robust solution to enhance the testing of GNNs by strategically prioritizing inputs for labeling, reducing annotation costs, and improving reliability before deployment.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in handling graph-structured data; however, they exhibit failures after deployment, which can cause severe consequences. Hence, conducting thorough testing before deployment becomes imperative to ensure the reliability of GNNs. However, thorough testing requires numerous manually annotated test data. To mitigate the annotation cost, strategically prioritizing and labeling high-quality unlabeled inputs for testing becomes crucial, which facilitates uncovering more model failures with a limited labeling budget. Unfortunately, existing test input prioritization techniques either overlook the valuable information contained in graph structures or are overly reliant on attributes extracted from the target model, i.e., model-aware attributes, whose quality can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose a novel test input prioritization framework, named GraphRank, for GNNs. GraphRank introduces model-agnostic attributes to compensate for the limitations of the model-aware ones. It also leverages the graph structure information to aggregate attributes from neighboring nodes, thereby enhancing the model-aware and model-agnostic attributes. Furthermore, GraphRank combines the above attributes with a binary classifier, using it as a ranking model to prioritize inputs. This classifier undergoes iterative training, which enables it to learn from each round's feedback and improve its performance accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate GraphRank's superiority over existing techniques.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the underexplored use of AI-powered tools in SVM in industry contexts, despite the documented benefits of AI in software development.

Method: The study conducted a survey with 60 practitioners across 27 countries, using both qualitative and quantitative questions to investigate adoption trends, tool strengths, and related challenges.

Result: AI-powered tools are widely adopted in the SVM life cycle, with a 69% user satisfaction rate. Concerns include false positives, lack of context, and trust issues.

Conclusion: The paper recommends improving explainability, contextual awareness, workflow integration, and validation practices to enhance the safe and effective use of AI-powered tools in SVM.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized software development, particularly by automating repetitive tasks and improving developer productivity. While these advancements are well-documented, the use of AI-powered tools for Software Vulnerability Management (SVM), such as vulnerability detection and repair, remains underexplored in industry settings. To bridge this gap, our study aims to determine the extent of the adoption of AI-powered tools for SVM, identify barriers and facilitators to the use, and gather insights to help improve the tools to meet industry needs better. We conducted a survey study involving 60 practitioners from diverse industry sectors across 27 countries. The survey incorporates both quantitative and qualitative questions to analyze the adoption trends, assess tool strengths, identify practical challenges, and uncover opportunities for improvement. Our findings indicate that AI-powered tools are used throughout the SVM life cycle, with 69\% of users reporting satisfaction with their current use. Practitioners value these tools for their speed, coverage, and accessibility. However, concerns about false positives, missing context, and trust issues remain prevalent. We observe a socio-technical adoption pattern in which AI outputs are filtered through human oversight and organizational governance. To support safe and effective use of AI for SVM, we recommend improvements in explainability, contextual awareness, integration workflows, and validation practices. We assert that these findings can offer practical guidance for practitioners, tool developers, and researchers seeking to enhance secure software development through the use of AI.

### [328] [SWE-EVO: Benchmarking Coding Agents in Long-Horizon Software Evolution Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18470)
*Minh V. T. Thai,Tue Le,Dung Nguyen Manh,Huy Phan Nhat,Nghi D. Q. Bui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-EVO, a benchmark for evaluating AI coding agents on long-horizon software engineering tasks, highlighting limitations of current models like GPT-5 in these scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in AI coding benchmarks, which focus on single-issue tasks and do not reflect the complex, long-term nature of real-world software engineering.

Method: The benchmark, SWE-EVO, was created using release notes and version histories of seven open-source Python projects. It includes 48 multi-step evolution tasks validated against test suites.

Result: State-of-the-art models like GPT-5 achieved only a 21% resolution rate on SWE-EVO, showing significant limitations in handling long-horizon, multi-file reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Current AI systems struggle with complex, sustained multi-step software development tasks, necessitating more advanced models and metrics to improve their real-world capabilities.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI coding agents focus on isolated, single-issue tasks such as fixing a bug or implementing a small feature. However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, Tool comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal a striking capability gap: even GPT-5 with OpenHands achieves only a 21 percent resolution rate on Tool, compared to 65 percent on the single-issue SWE-Bench Verified. This demonstrates that current agents struggle with sustained, multi-file reasoning. We also propose Fix Rate, a fine-grained metric that captures partial progress toward solving these complex, long-horizon tasks.

### [329] [Toward Training Superintelligent Software Agents through Self-Play SWE-RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18552)
*Yuxiang Wei,Zhiqing Sun,Emily McMilin,Jonas Gehring,David Zhang,Gabriel Synnaeve,Daniel Fried,Lingming Zhang,Sida Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSR, a self-play training paradigm that helps train superintelligent software agents using minimal data assumptions, iteratively improving software debugging and creation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dependency of current software agents on human-curated training data and environments, which limits the path to developing superintelligent agents.

Method: The approach involves reinforcement learning in a self-play environment, where a single LLM agent autonomously trains by injecting and repairing software bugs within real-world repositories, relying on sandboxed environments with source code and dependencies only.

Result: SSR demonstrates significant self-improvement, outperforming human-data baselines on benchmarks, even when evaluated on natural language issues beyond the self-play training scope.

Conclusion: This self-play paradigm opens a pathway for developing autonomous systems that can surpass human expertise in software understanding, problem-solving, and creation, pushing toward superintelligence.

Abstract: While current software agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and agentic reinforcement learning (RL) can boost programmer productivity, their training data (e.g., GitHub issues and pull requests) and environments (e.g., pass-to-pass and fail-to-pass tests) heavily depend on human knowledge or curation, posing a fundamental barrier to superintelligence. In this paper, we present Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a first step toward training paradigms for superintelligent software agents. Our approach takes minimal data assumptions, only requiring access to sandboxed repositories with source code and installed dependencies, with no need for human-labeled issues or tests. Grounded in these real-world codebases, a single LLM agent is trained via reinforcement learning in a self-play setting to iteratively inject and repair software bugs of increasing complexity, with each bug formally specified by a test patch rather than a natural language issue description. On the SWE-bench Verified and SWE-Bench Pro benchmarks, SSR achieves notable self-improvement (+10.4 and +7.8 points, respectively) and consistently outperforms the human-data baseline over the entire training trajectory, despite being evaluated on natural language issues absent from self-play. Our results, albeit early, suggest a path where agents autonomously gather extensive learning experiences from real-world software repositories, ultimately enabling superintelligent systems that exceed human capabilities in understanding how systems are constructed, solving novel challenges, and autonomously creating new software from scratch.

*Bin Wang,Wenjie Yu,Yilu Zhong,Hao Yu,Keke Lian,Chaohua Lu,Hongfang Zheng,Dong Zhang,Hui Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines the real-world impact of AI-generated code on software development, highlighting its adoption patterns, security consequences, and collaborative practices with human developers. It includes detailed analysis based on data from GitHub and CVEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the prevalence and security implications of AI-generated code as large language models grow integral to modern software development.

Method: The authors developed a detection pipeline and benchmark to differentiate AI-generated code from human-written code. They analyzed large-scale development commits and CVE-linked code changes across top GitHub repositories.

Result: Findings show that AI-generated code significantly contributes to new code but is concentrated in specific areas such as glue code and refactoring. It reveals security concerns, especially AI-induced vulnerabilities, and illustrates how AI-human collaborations impact the security lifecycle of software.

Conclusion: AI-generated code is a growing presence in software development, influencing coding practices and security. The study underscores the need for proper human oversight to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and ensure robust software development processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code generation are becoming integral to modern software development, but their real-world prevalence and security impact remain poorly understood.
  We present the first large-scale empirical study of AI-generated code (AIGCode) in the wild. We build a high-precision detection pipeline and a representative benchmark to distinguish AIGCode from human-written code, and apply them to (i) development commits from the top 1,000 GitHub repositories (2022-2025) and (ii) 7,000+ recent CVE-linked code changes. This lets us label commits, files, and functions along a human/AI axis and trace how AIGCode moves through projects and vulnerability life cycles.
  Our measurements show three ecological patterns. First, AIGCode is already a substantial fraction of new code, but adoption is structured: AI concentrates in glue code, tests, refactoring, documentation, and other boilerplate, while core logic and security-critical configurations remain mostly human-written. Second, adoption has security consequences: some CWE families are overrepresented in AI-tagged code, and near-identical insecure templates recur across unrelated projects, suggesting "AI-induced vulnerabilities" propagated by shared models rather than shared maintainers. Third, in human-AI edit chains, AI introduces high-throughput changes while humans act as security gatekeepers; when review is shallow, AI-introduced defects persist longer, remain exposed on network-accessible surfaces, and spread to more files and repositories.
  We will open-source the complete dataset and release analysis artifacts and fine-grained documentation of our methodology and findings.

### [331] [Code2Doc: A Quality-First Curated Dataset for Code Documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18748)
*Recep Kaan Karaman,Meftun Akarsu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Code2Doc, a curated dataset for code documentation generation to enhance data quality and reduce issues like noise, duplication, and AI contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code documentation datasets lack quality control, leading to noisy data and challenging evaluation for automatic documentation models.

Method: A four-stage curation pipeline was used to build Code2Doc, ensuring documentation completeness, filtering by structural criteria, removing duplicates, and flagging AI-generated documentation.

Result: Code2Doc consists of 13,358 high-quality examples, achieves a quality score of 6.93/10, and improves model performance significantly with BLEU and ROUGE-L score gains.

Conclusion: The release of Code2Doc and its curation pipeline facilitates reproducible research, emphasizing the importance of data quality in code documentation generation models.

Abstract: The performance of automatic code documentation generation models depends critically on the quality of the training data used for supervision. However, most existing code documentation datasets are constructed through large scale scraping of public repositories with limited quality control. As a result, they often contain noisy documentation, extensive duplication, and increasing contamination from AI generated content. These issues weaken the supervision signal available to learning-based models and complicate evaluation.
  We introduce \textbf{Code2Doc}, a quality-first curated dataset for function-level code documentation generation. Code2Doc consists of 13,358 high-quality function-documentation pairs extracted from widely used open-source repositories spanning five programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C++. The dataset is constructed using a four-stage curation pipeline that enforces documentation completeness and clarity, filters functions based on structural and complexity criteria, removes exact and near-duplicate code, and identifies documentation likely to be AI generated. Starting from 52,069 extracted candidates, only 25.6 percent satisfy all quality constraints.
  We provide a detailed analysis of the resulting dataset, which achieves a mean documentation quality score of 6.93 out of 10. Overall, 86.9% of samples contain explicit type annotations, and only 2.9\% are flagged as potentially AI generated. Baseline experiments show that fine-tuning a large language model on Code2Doc yields relative improvements of 29.47% in BLEU and 24.04% in ROUGE-L over zero shot performance, despite the modest dataset size. We release both the dataset and the full curation pipeline to support reproducible research on automatic code documentation generation.

*M M Abid Naziri,Stefano Carlo Lambertenghi,Andrea Stocco,Marcelo d'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Foresee improves bug detection in self-driving car software by identifying 'near misses' during simulations and performing local fuzzing. It's more effective and faster than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation-based testing struggles with reliable and cost-effective bug identification in self-driving car software, creating a need for improved techniques.

Method: Foresee uses a misbehavior forecaster to detect near misses in vehicle simulations, followed by localized fuzzing to unearth potential failures.

Result: Foresee outperforms baselines, detecting up to 128.70% more failures and working up to 2.49x faster. Combined with DriveFuzz, it increases detection by 93.94%.

Conclusion: Foresee is an efficient and effective tool for debugging self-driving systems and complements advanced fuzzing techniques like DriveFuzz.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing is the standard practice for assessing the reliability of self-driving cars' software before deployment. Existing bug-finding techniques are either unreliable or expensive. We build on the insight that near misses observed during simulations may point to potential failures. We propose Foresee, a technique that identifies near misses using a misbehavior forecaster that computes possible future states of the ego-vehicle under test. Foresee performs local fuzzing in the neighborhood of each candidate near miss to surface previously unknown failures. In our empirical study, we evaluate the effectiveness of different configurations of Foresee using several scenarios provided in the CARLA simulator on both end-to-end and modular self-driving systems and examine its complementarity with the state-of-the-art fuzzer DriveFuzz. Our results show that Foresee is both more effective and more efficient than the baselines. Foresee exposes 128.70% and 38.09% more failures than a random approach and a state-of-the-art failure predictor while being 2.49x and 1.42x faster, respectively. Moreover, when used in combination with DriveFuzz, Foresee enhances failure detection by up to 93.94%.

### [333] [What Drives Issue Resolution Speed? An Empirical Study of Scientific Workflow Systems on GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18852)
*Khairul Alam,Banani Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study analyzes 21,116 GitHub SWS project issues to understand factors affecting issue resolution speed, highlighting key improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate factors driving issue resolution speed in Scientific Workflow Systems (SWS) for maintaining software reliability and sustainability.

Method: An empirical study using data from GitHub-based SWS repositories, focusing on issue characteristics, contributor interactions, labeling, and management practices.

Result: 68.91% of issues are resolved, with half resolved within 18.09 days. Structured management and labeling help improve resolution speed.

Conclusion: SWS projects follow structured management practices, but resolution speed varies. Developers are recommended to apply better practices for issue handling.

Abstract: Scientific Workflow Systems (SWSs) play a vital role in enabling reproducible, scalable, and automated scientific analysis. Like other open-source software, these systems depend on active maintenance and community engagement to remain reliable and sustainable. However, despite the importance of timely issue resolution for software quality and community trust, little is known about what drives issue resolution speed within SWSs. This paper presents an empirical study of issue management and resolution across a collection of GitHub-hosted SWS projects. We analyze 21,116 issues to investigate how project characteristics, issue metadata, and contributor interactions affect time-to-close. Specifically, we address two research questions: (1) how issues are managed and addressed in SWSs, and (2) how issue and contributor features relate to issue resolution speed. We find that 68.91% of issues are closed, with half of them resolved within 18.09 days. Our results show that although SWS projects follow structured issue management practices, the issue resolution speed varies considerably across systems. Factors such as labeling and assigning issues are associated with faster issue resolution. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for developers to better manage SWS repository issues and improve their quality.

*Shaokang Jiang,Daye Nam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies developer-authored context for AI coding assistants, analyzing 401 open-source repositories with machine-readable directives to develop a taxonomy organized into five main themes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how developers provide machine-readable directives for AI tools, particularly in software engineering where project-specific contexts like architecture and conventions are crucial.

Method: The authors conducted a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules and used this data to develop a taxonomy of relevant developer-provided project contexts.

Result: A taxonomy of project context with five major themes (Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, Examples) was created, and patterns of context usage across different projects and languages were identified.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of developer-provided context in improving AI tool responses and suggests designing next-gen AI developer tools that are more context-aware and tailored to varied software projects.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, research shows that their effectiveness depends not only on explicit prompts but also on the broader context provided. This requirement is especially pronounced in software engineering, where the goals, architecture, and collaborative conventions of an existing project play critical roles in response quality. To support this, many AI coding assistants have introduced ways for developers to author persistent, machine-readable directives that encode a project's unique constraints. Although this practice is growing, the content of these directives remains unstudied.
  This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to characterize this emerging form of developer-provided context. Through a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of project context that developers consider essential, organized into five high-level themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples. Our study also explores how this context varies across different project types and programming languages, offering implications for the next generation of context-aware AI developer tools.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of OpenAI models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4.0 Turbo for aiding sprint planning, concluding that their outputs are currently unsuitable for direct application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can efficiently support sprint planning in Scrum methodology.

Method: Case studies were conducted with manually created data sets, using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.0 Turbo, and Val) to generate results.

Result: The experiments showed that the outputs of these models were not of satisfactory quality for direct use in Scrum projects.

Conclusion: Large Language Models require improvement to generate outcomes of acceptable quality for adopting them in sprint planning tasks.

Abstract: Planning for an upcoming project iteration (sprint) is one of the key activities in Scrum planning. In this paper, we present our work in progress on exploring the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving this problem. We conducted case studies with manually created data sets to investigate the applicability of OpenAI models for supporting the sprint planning activities. In our experiments, we applied three models provided OpenAI: GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.0 Turbo, and Val. The experiments demonstrated that the results produced by the models aren't of acceptable quality for direct use in Scrum projects.

*Muhammad Usman Tariq,Abhinav Jangda,Angelica Moreira,Madan Musuvathi,Tyler Sorensen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces PEAK, an AI assistant for GPU kernel optimization using natural language transformations driven by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with low-level backend code, particularly in performance-critical GPU kernels due to sparse code examples and hardware complexity.

Method: PEAK employs modular infrastructure enabling validation and performance evaluation of GPU kernel optimizations written as natural language transformations executed by LLMs.

Result: PEAK implementations are competitive with vendor libraries across CUDA, HIP, and HLSL, achieving documented FLOPS for HLSL (without a library) and demonstrating flexibility.

Conclusion: PEAK enhances productivity for performance engineers or operates autonomously, providing a forward-compatible AI-driven optimization platform for GPU kernels.

Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) are showing promising impact in software development and programming assistance. However, these models struggle when operating on low-level backend code. This challenge is exacerbated in the domain of GPU kernels, where performance-critical details are coupled to rapidly evolving hardware characteristics and available code examples are sparse.
  In this work, we introduce PEAK, a Performance Engineering AI-Assistant for GPU Kernels powered by natural language transformations. PEAK utilizes the key insight that iterative code transformations (optimizations) can straightforwardly be written in natural language, and then carried out by LLMs. Thus, these transformations can be rapidly developed, encoding general portable optimizations, but also easily specialized to specific GPU devices and even kernels. These natural transformations are supported by a modular and extensible infrastructure that additionally performs validation and performance evaluation. We demonstrate the flexibility of PEAK by instantiating it for three backends, CUDA, HIP, and HLSL, and create 16 natural transformations for optimizing matrix multiplication kernels. We show that our resulting implementations are competitive with vendor libraries when available, and for HLSL (without a library) our implementations match the hardware documented FLOPS. PEAK allows the fine-grained exploration of several research questions around how LLMs behave in this domain, including characterizing transformations and their errors; and how performance evolves along optimization sequences. PEAK provides an interface that can either be utilized by performance engineers to improve productivity, or driven completely autonomously (e.g., by an AI agent), providing a forward-compatible design that can continue to improve with advances in AI capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a solution for Bangla code generation, which lacks large-scale annotated datasets and tools.

Method: Proposes a retrieval-augmented dual-model system with self-refinement and systematic prompt engineering.

Result: BanglaForge attained a competitive 84.00% Pass@1 accuracy on the BLP-2025 benchmark.

Conclusion: BanglaForge proves the effectiveness of leveraging retrieval and self-refinement in low-resource conditions.

Abstract: Bangla is a low-resource language for code generation, lacking large-scale annotated datasets and tools to transform natural language specifications into executable programs. This makes Bangla-to-code generation a challenging task requiring innovative solutions. To address this, we introduce BanglaForge, a novel framework for generating code from Bangla function descriptions. BanglaForge leverages a retrieval-augmented dual-model collaboration paradigm with self-refinement, combining in-context learning, llm-based translation, systematic prompt engineering, and iterative self-refinement based on execution feedback, where a coder generates initial solutions and a reviewer enhances them for robustness. On the BLP-2025 Bangla Code Generation benchmark, BanglaForge achieves a competitive Pass@1 accuracy of 84.00%, demonstrating the effectiveness of retrieval, model collaboration, and self-refinement for low-resource Bangla code generation.

*Xiaolan Cai,Mathieu O'Neil,Stefano Zacchiroli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines unrecognised labour in corporate innovation systems by analyzing contributions to R, a statistical software ecosystem, linking digital platform labour to contributors' professional employment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the overlooked contributions of researchers in digital platforms, focusing on their unpaid work that supports corporate systems and how it connects to broader professional roles.

Method: Analyzed 8,924 R package repositories on GitHub through quantitative methods (commits and communications analysis) and qualitative assessment of the free, libre, and open-source software (FLOSS) ideology.

Result: Researchers and non-affiliated contributors are major stakeholders in R package repositories. Researchers undertake unpaid support and collaborative work, benefiting industry employees, while FLOSS ideology legitimizes exploiting university resources for corporate gains.

Conclusion: Unrecognised researcher labour significantly supports corporate innovation while being unpaid and undervalued, facilitated by FLOSS, which rationalizes the exploitation of academic resources by industry.

Abstract: This article explores the role of unrecognised labour in corporate innovation systems via an analysis of researcher coding and discursive contributions to R, one of the largest statistical software ecosystems. Studies of online platforms typically focus on how platform affordances constrain participants' actions, and profit from their labour. We innovate by connecting the labour performed inside digital platforms to the professional employment of participants. Our case study analyses 8,924 R package repositories on GitHub, examining commits and communications. Our quantitative findings show that researchers, alongside non-affiliated contributors, are the most frequent owners of R package repositories and their most active contributors. Researchers are more likely to hold official roles compared to the average, and to engage in collaborative problem-solving and support work during package development. This means there is, underneath the 'recognised' category of star researchers who transition between academia and industry and secure generous funding, an 'unrecognised' category of researchers who not only create and maintain key statistical infrastructure, but also provide support to industry employees, for no remuneration. Our qualitative findings show how this unrecognised labour affects practitioners. Finally, our analysis of the ideology and practice of free, libre and open source software (FLOSS) shows how this ideology and practice legitimate the use of 'university rents' by Big Tech.

*Junyao Ye,Zhen Li,Xi Tang,Shouhuai Xu,Deqing Zou,Zhongsheng Yuan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents Semantically-Equivalent Transformation (SET)-based backdoor attacks targeting neural code models, achieving high success rates and evasion against current defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks pose security threats to neural code models, and existing defenses focus narrowly on injection-based attacks. This overlooks stealthier methods, creating a false sense of security.

Method: A SET-based attack framework utilizes semantics-preserving, low-prevalence code transformations to generate hard-to-detect backdoor triggers in neural code models.

Result: SET-based attacks achieve >90% success rates, evade current defenses by over 25.13% compared to injection-based attacks, and normalization countermeasures provide only partial protection.

Conclusion: SET-based attacks highlight the inadequacy of current defenses and motivate research into more effective, scalable countermeasures tailored to this robust and stealthy attack type.

Abstract: Neural code models have been increasingly incorporated into software development processes. However, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks presents a significant security risk. The state-of-the-art understanding focuses on injection-based attacks, which insert anomalous patterns into software code. These attacks can be neutralized by standard sanitization techniques. This status quo may lead to a false sense of security regarding backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new kind of backdoor attacks, dubbed Semantically-Equivalent Transformation (SET)-based backdoor attacks, which use semantics-preserving low-prevalence code transformations to generate stealthy triggers. We propose a framework to guide the generation of such triggers. Our experiments across five tasks, six languages, and models like CodeBERT, CodeT5, and StarCoder show that SET-based attacks achieve high success rates (often >90%) while preserving model utility. The attack proves highly stealthy, evading state-of-the-art defenses with detection rates on average over 25.13% lower than injection-based counterparts. We evaluate normalization-based countermeasures and find they offer only partial mitigation, confirming the attack's robustness. These results motivate further investigation into scalable defenses tailored to SET-based attacks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the ability of GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini to predict code entities impacted by source code changes and concludes both models perform poorly with slight improvements when additional context like diff hunks is provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of manually analyzing source code changes and their impact, leveraging the potential of large language models (LLMs) in assisting such tasks.

Method: Constructed a dataset including seed changes, change pairs, and change types for commits. Evaluated GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini in two configurations: one using seed-change information and parent commit tree, another also including diff hunks.

Result: Both models performed poorly at predicting impacted code entities but GPT-5 outperformed GPT-5-mini. Diff hunks slightly improved their prediction performance.

Conclusion: The analysis shows that GPT-based models have limited capability in understanding code change impacts and future work must improve their performance for effective application in this domain.

Abstract: Understanding source code changes and their impact on other code entities is a crucial skill in software development. However, the analysis of code changes and their impact is often performed manually and therefore is time-consuming. Recent advancements in AI, and in particular large language models (LLMs) show promises to help developers in various code analysis tasks. However, the extent to which this potential can be utilized for understanding code changes and their impact is underexplored. To address this gap, we study the capabilities of GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini to predict the code entities impacted by given source code changes. We construct a dataset containing information about seed-changes, change pairs, and change types for each commit. Existing datasets lack crucial information about seed changes and impacted code entities. Our experiments evaluate the LLMs in two configurations: (1) seed-change information and the parent commit tree and (2) seed-change information, the parent commit tree, and the diff hunk of each seed change. We found that both LLMs perform poorly in the two experiments, whereas GPT-5 outperforms GPT-5-mini. Furthermore, the provision of the diff hunks helps both models to slightly improve their performance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines deep linguistic relationships between programming languages and suggests effective strategies to enhance multilingual code LLM training using these insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and leverage the inherent relationships between programming languages for improving performance and efficiency in training multilingual code language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors propose an embedding-based framework, defining 21 linguistic features to generate feature-aligned code samples across 19 languages. They construct a similarity matrix using embedded semantically parallel code snippets and perform hierarchical clustering to find language relationships. Based on these relationships, they developed strategies like transfer learning, proximity-guided curriculum learning, and centroid-based code translation.

Result: The method identifies clear hierarchical structures among programming languages and clusters linguistically related ones. Experimentation on 4 code intelligence tasks validated the proposed strategies, showing significant performance improvement in multilingual LLMs.

Conclusion: Understanding linguistic relationships among programming languages can optimize multilingual LLM training. The study highlights effective methods such as transfer learning and hierarchical clustering, enabling better organization and performance of these models.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of diverse programming languages presents both opportunities and challenges for developing multilingual code LLMs. While existing techniques often train code LLMs by simply aggregating multilingual code data, few explore the deeper relationships between programming languages(PLs) and how such relationships can be utilized to optimize the training and inference of code LLMs. In this work, we investigate 2 fundamental questions: 1) What are the deep linguistic relationships among PLs? and 2) How can these relationships be leveraged to improve multilingual code LLMs? We propose an embedding-based framework to uncover the latent families of PLs. Our approach begins by defining 21 primary linguistic features of programming languages, such as variable definition, control structures, and method declarations, and then employs LLMs to generate feature-aligned code samples across multiple languages. By embedding these semantically parallel code snippets from 19 languages, we construct a similarity matrix and perform hierarchical clustering to uncover inherent language relationships. Our analysis reveals clear hierarchical structures among programming languages. Closely related languages form well-defined clusters (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Swift group together), while Go exhibits as a central language with the highest cross-language similarity. Building on the uncovered language families, we propose three strategies to enhance multilingual LLM training: transfer learning across linguistically related languages, linguistic proximity-guided curriculum learning, and centroid-based intermediary code translation. Experiments on 4 code intelligence tasks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve multilingual LLM performance. This work offers a universal perspective on programming languages and advances more effective strategies for multilingual code LLM training.

*Gabrielle O'Brien,Alexis Parker,Nasir Eisty,Jeffrey Carver*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates how scientists use generative AI tools for programming and the factors affecting their perception of productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of proper training in software development among scientists and explore how generative AI tools can assist while identifying potential risks of over-reliance.

Method: Conducted a survey with 868 scientists who program to understand adoption patterns, tool preferences, and productivity factors associated with generative AI tools.

Result: Adoption of generative AI is higher in students and those less experienced, with general-purpose tools like ChatGPT being preferred. Limited use of formal practices and inexperience correlates with perceived productivity, but formal practices can mitigate inexperience.

Conclusion: While generative AI tools show promise in aiding scientific programmers, the focus on code generation over validation raises concerns about the reliability of research code.

Abstract: Programming is essential to modern scientific research, yet most scientists report inadequate training for the software development their work demands. Generative AI tools capable of code generation may support scientific programmers, but user studies indicate risks of over-reliance, particularly among inexperienced users. We surveyed 868 scientists who program, examining adoption patterns, tool preferences, and factors associated with perceived productivity. Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once. These findings suggest scientific programmers using generative AI may gauge productivity by code generation rather than validation, raising concerns about research code integrity.

### [343] [Re-assessing the evidence for mental rotation abilities in children using computational models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17972)
*Arthur Aubret,Jochen Triesch*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study re-evaluates mental rotation (MR) abilities in children using computational models and suggests that genuine MR skills may not develop until after the age of 5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evidence for MR in children is limited and relies heavily on paradigms derived from adult studies. There is a need to reassess and understand how children develop MR abilities.

Method: The study used computational models that simulate infants' object recognition development through embodied interactions. Two alternative object recognition strategies were tested against classical MR tasks conducted with children aged 6 months to 5 years.

Result: The study found that children younger than 5 years do not demonstrate genuine MR abilities. Results from traditional MR tasks can be explained by simple recognition strategies, like pixel-wise stimuli comparison.

Conclusion: The study challenges the assumption that young children have MR abilities, suggesting the need for a re-evaluation of how and when these abilities develop.

Abstract: There is strong and diverse evidence for mental rotation (MR) abilities in adults. However, current evidence for MR in children rests on just a few behavioral paradigms adapted from the adult literature. Here, we leverage recent computational models of the development of children's object recognition abilities to re-assess the evidence for MR in children. The computational models simulate infants' acquisition of object representations during embodied interactions with objects. We consider two different object recognition strategies, different from MRs, and assess their ability to replicate results from three classical MR tasks assigned to children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Our results show that MR may play no role in producing the results obtained from children younger than 5 years. In fact, we find that a simple recognition strategy that reflects a pixel-wise comparison of stimuli is sufficient to model children's behavior in the most used MR task. Thus, our study reopens the debate on how and when children develop genuine MR abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of low signal-to-noise ratio and high temporal dimensionality in decoding linguistically meaningful representations from non-invasive neural recordings, specifically using MEG data.

Method: The proposed approach introduces MEGState, a new architecture tailored for phoneme decoding by capturing fine-grained cortical dynamics evoked by auditory stimuli. The performance is evaluated on the LibriBrain dataset.

Result: MEGState consistently outperforms baseline models across multiple evaluation metrics in experiments with the LibriBrain dataset.

Conclusion: MEGState proves effective in advancing MEG-based phoneme decoding, supporting its potential as a scalable solution for non-invasive brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Decoding linguistically meaningful representations from non-invasive neural recordings remains a central challenge in neural speech decoding. Among available neuroimaging modalities, magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides a safe and repeatable means of mapping speech-related cortical dynamics, yet its low signal-to-noise ratio and high temporal dimensionality continue to hinder robust decoding. In this work, we introduce MEGState, a novel architecture for phoneme decoding from MEG signals that captures fine-grained cortical responses evoked by auditory stimuli. Extensive experiments on the LibriBrain dataset demonstrate that MEGState consistently surpasses baseline model across multiple evaluation metrics. These findings highlight the potential of MEG-based phoneme decoding as a scalable pathway toward non-invasive brain-computer interfaces for speech.

### [345] [The Subject of Emergent Misalignment in Superintelligence: An Anthropological, Cognitive Neuropsychological, Machine-Learning, and Ontological Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17989)
*Muhammad Osama Imran,Roshni Lulla,Rodney Sappington*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper critiques current approaches to superintelligence misalignment, calling for a re-centering of the human subject and exploring ethical and conceptual blindspots in AI discourse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address conceptual and ethical gaps in understanding superintelligence misalignment, particularly the neglect of the human subject and the implications of an under-explored "AI unconscious."

Method: The authors analyze the sociotechnical imaginaries and hidden dimensions of AI systems through a theoretical lens, focusing on how human subjectivity and ethical vulnerabilities are erased.

Result: The study reveals that the discourse around superintelligence misalignment overlooks the relational dynamics between humans and AI systems, instead framing misalignment as deeply entwined with scalability-focused AI development.

Conclusion: Misalignment should be reframed as a relational instability within human-machine ecologies, emphasizing the co-constitution of ethical and unconscious dimensions in both humans and AI.

Abstract: We examine the conceptual and ethical gaps in current representations of Superintelligence misalignment. We find throughout Superintelligence discourse an absent human subject, and an under-developed theorization of an "AI unconscious" that together are potentiality laying the groundwork for anti-social harm. With the rise of AI Safety that has both thematic potential for establishing pro-social and anti-social potential outcomes, we ask: what place does the human subject occupy in these imaginaries? How is human subjecthood positioned within narratives of catastrophic failure or rapid "takeoff" toward superintelligence? On another register, we ask: what unconscious or repressed dimensions are being inscribed into large-scale AI models? Are we to blame these agents in opting for deceptive strategies when undesirable patterns are inherent within our beings? In tracing these psychic and epistemic absences, our project calls for re-centering the human subject as the unstable ground upon which the ethical, unconscious, and misaligned dimensions of both human and machinic intelligence are co-constituted. Emergent misalignment cannot be understood solely through technical diagnostics typical of contemporary machine-learning safety research. Instead, it represents a multi-layered crisis. The human subject disappears not only through computational abstraction but through sociotechnical imaginaries that prioritize scalability, acceleration, and efficiency over vulnerability, finitude, and relationality. Likewise, the AI unconscious emerges not as a metaphor but as a structural reality of modern deep learning systems: vast latent spaces, opaque pattern formation, recursive symbolic play, and evaluation-sensitive behavior that surpasses explicit programming. These dynamics necessitate a reframing of misalignment as a relational instability embedded within human-machine ecologies.

### [346] [Responses to transient perturbation can distinguish intrinsic from latent criticality in spiking neural populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18113)
*Jacob T. Crosser,Braden A. W. Brinkman*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores distinguishing whether heavy-tailed correlations in neural activity are caused by intrinsic neural circuitry or driven by external latent sensory inputs using a perturbative response analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify if neural activity's heavy-tailed correlations are intrinsic to circuits or driven by external latent variables, aiding proper interpretation of brain functions.

Method: The paper introduces perturbative input measurements and scaling theory for covariance and response functions in stochastic spiking neuron models, supported by simulations.

Result: Through the simulations, the proposed method successfully differentiates intrinsic circuit-generated correlations from those driven by latent variables.

Conclusion: Measuring responses to perturbative inputs offers a new avenue to discern intrinsic vs. latent-driven neural correlations, with potential application to realistic neural models.

Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural circuitry operates near criticality to reap the computational benefits of accessing a wide range of timescales. The theory of critical phenomena generally predicts heavy-tailed (power-law) correlations in space and time near criticality, but it has been argued that in the brain such correlations could be inherited from ``latent variables,'' such as external sensory signals that are not directly observed when recording from neural circuitry. Distinguishing whether heavy-tailed correlations in neural activity are intrinsically generated within a neural circuit or are driven by unobserved latent variables is crucial for properly interpreting circuit functions. We argue that measuring neural responses to sudden perturbative inputs, rather than correlations in ongoing activity, can disambiguate these cases. We demonstrate this approach in a model of stochastic spiking neuron populations receiving external latent input that can be tuned to a critical state. We propose a scaling theory for the covariance and response functions of the spiking network, which we validate with simulations. We end by discussing how our approach might generalize to models of neural populations with more realistic biophysical details.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Coord2Region is an open-source Python tool for neuroimaging that maps 3D brain coordinates to anatomical regions across atlases, integrates meta-analytic resources, and uses LLMs to provide summaries and visualizations, while offering both command-line and web-based functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in reproducibility, efficiency, and accessibility in coordinate-based neuroimaging workflows by streamlining connections between brain coordinates, anatomical regions, and neuroimaging literature.

Method: Coord2Region utilizes atlas-based anatomical labeling, integration with the NiMARE project's meta-analytic resources, and optional AI functionalities via large language models (LLMs). It supports single and batch queries, provides a command-line and web interface, and enables cloud-based execution through Hugging Face.

Result: Coord2Region simplifies and enhances neuroimaging workflows by automating region mapping, integrating literature, and enabling AI-powered summaries while providing flexible, user-friendly interfaces and reducing manual errors.

Conclusion: Coord2Region improves reproducibility, promotes robust research practices, and lowers barriers for researchers by offering a unified, accessible, and versatile tool for coordinate-based neuroimaging workflows.

Abstract: We present Coord2Region, an open-source Python package that streamlines coordinate-based neuroimaging workflows by automatically mapping 3D brain coordinates (e.g., MNI or Talairach) to anatomical regions across multiple atlases. The package links mapped coordinates to meta-analytic resources via the Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment (NiMARE) , providing direct integration with Neurosynth and NeuroQuery. This directly connects coordinates and regions to the broader neuroimaging literature. In addition to atlas-based labeling and literature retrieval, Coord2Region offers an optional large language model (LLM) functionality that generates text summaries of linked studies and illustrative images of queried regions. These AI-assisted features are intended to support interpretation and exploration, while remaining clearly complementary to peer-reviewed literature and established neuroimaging tools. Coord2Region provides a unified pipeline with a robust command-line interface, flexible dataset management, and provider-agnostic LLM utilities, and it supports both single-coordinate and high-throughput batch queries with nearest-region fallback for volume and surface atlases. Furthermore, Coord2Region includes a web interface for interactive configuration (via JSON Schema forms) and cloud execution (via Hugging Face), enabling users to build YAML configurations and run analyses in-browser without local installation. Together, these capabilities lower friction, reduce manual errors, and improve reproducibility in coordinate-centric neuroimaging workflows, promoting more robust and transparent research practices.

### [348] [Deep Teleportation: Quantum Simulation of Conscious Report in Attentional Blink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18585)
*Ahmad Sohrabi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a quantum model for simulating human conscious reporting in the attentional blink paradigm, successfully replicating key phenomena like Lag 1 sparing and lag divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling the challenging phenomenon of consciousness, which classical approaches struggle with, using quantum methods to align well with human experimental data.

Method: Utilizing a three-qubit entanglement ansatz circuit structured as a deep teleportation channel combined with neural network analysis for conscious reporting simulations.

Result: The model successfully reproduced human response patterns in attentional blink tasks, including effects of lag periods and masking, matching experimental outcomes.

Conclusion: Quantum-based cognitive models offer promising tools for understanding consciousness and outperform classical methods in replicating such phenomena.

Abstract: Recent quantum models of cognition have successfully simulated several interesting effects in human experimental data, from vision to reasoning and recently even consciousness. The latter case, consciousness has been a quite challenging phenomenon to model, and most efforts have been through abstract mathematical quantum methods, mainly focused on conceptual issues. Classical (non-quantum) models of consciousness-related experiments exist, but they generally fail to align well with human data. We developed a straightforward quantum model to simulate conscious reporting of seeing or missing competing stimuli within the famous attentional blink paradigm. In an attentional blink task, a target stimulus (T2) that appears after a previous one (T1) can be consciously reported if the delay between presenting them is short enough (called lag 1), otherwise it can be rendered invisible during the so-called refractory period of attention (lags 2 to 6 and even longer). For modeling this phenomenon, we employed a three-qubit entanglement ansatz circuit in the form of a deep teleportation channel instead of the well-known EPR channel. While reporting the competing stimuli was supposed to be the classical measurement outcomes, the effect of distractor stimuli (i.e., masks, if any) was encoded simply as random angle rotations. The simulation outcome for different states was measured, and the classical outcome probabilities were further used as inputs to a simple linear neural network. The result revealed a non-linear, alternating state pattern that closely mirrors human responses in conscious stimuli reporting. The main result was a successful simulation of Lag 1 sparing, lag 7 divergence, and masking effect through probabilistic outcome of measurement in different conditions.

### [349] [A Rate-Distortion Perspective on the Emergence of Number Sense in Unsupervised Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19450)
*Leo D'Amato,Davide Nuzzi,Alberto Testolin,Ivilin Peev Stoianov,Marco Zorzi,Giovanni Pezzulo*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores the emergence of number sense in unsupervised generative models using rate-distortion theory (RDT), showing how encoding capacity impacts numerosity perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the development of number sense—a core cognitive ability—in unsupervised generative models and to investigate how it supports adaptive behaviors and mathematical learning using RDT under limited computational resources.

Method: The authors train $β$-Variational Autoencoders (representing RDT principles) on synthetic image datasets with varying object numbers and assess model performance through numerosity tasks, latent-space, and generative analyses.

Result: The study finds that numerosity perception scales with encoding capacity (power law relationship). At high capacity, models perform similarly to supervised setups, generalize well, and create robust numerical codes, whereas low-capacity models exhibit deficits.

Conclusion: The study concludes that unsupervised generative models can develop a number sense, with RDT effectively explaining how encoding capacity shapes numerical perception and aligns well with human behavioral performance.

Abstract: Number sense is a core cognitive ability supporting various adaptive behaviors and is foundational for mathematical learning. Here, we study its emergence in unsupervised generative models through the lens of rate-distortion theory (RDT), a normative framework for understanding information processing under limited resources. We train $β$-Variational Autoencoders -- which embody key formal principles of RDT -- on synthetic images containing varying numbers of items, as commonly used in numerosity perception research. We systematically vary the encoding capacity and assess the models' sensitivity to numerosity and the robustness of the emergent numerical representations through a comprehensive set of analyses, including numerosity estimation and discrimination tasks, latent-space analysis, generative capabilities and generalization to novel stimuli. In line with RDT, we find that behavioral performance in numerosity perception and the ability to extract numerosity unconfounded by non-numerical visual features scale with encoding capacity according to a power law. At high capacity, the unsupervised model develops a robust neural code for numerical information, with performance closely approximating a supervised model explicitly trained for visual enumeration. It exhibits strong generative abilities and generalizes well to novel images, whereas at low capacity, the model shows marked deficits in numerosity perception and representation. Finally, comparison with human data shows that models trained at intermediate capacity levels span the full range of human behavioral performance while still developing a robust emergent numerical code. In sum, our results show that unsupervised generative models can develop a number sense and demonstrate that rate-distortion theory provides a powerful information-theoretic framework for understanding how capacity constraints shape numerosity perception.

### [350] [Sampling from multimodal distributions with warm starts: Non-asymptotic bounds for the Reweighted Annealed Leap-Point Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17977)
*Holden Lee,Matheau Santana-Gijzen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents Reweighted ALPS (Re-ALPS), an improved sampling method for multimodal distributions, which relies on Monte Carlo partition function estimation to overcome limitations of ALPS and handle complex geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of sampling efficiently from multimodal distributions—critical in Bayesian inference and machine learning—despite classical MCMC methods suffering from exponential mixing times, motivates the research.

Method: Re-ALPS builds on Annealed Leap-Point Sampler (ALPS), introducing Monte Carlo-based partition function estimation and removing reliance on Gaussian approximations and Hessian information.

Result: Re-ALPS demonstrated polynomial-time bounds in complex settings and superior mixing performance over ALPS, particularly for heavy-tailed distributions.

Conclusion: Re-ALPS improves upon previous methods by enabling efficient multimodal distribution sampling without restrictive assumptions, facilitating broader applications in statistical modeling.

Abstract: Sampling from multimodal distributions is a central challenge in Bayesian inference and machine learning. In light of hardness results for sampling -- classical MCMC methods, even with tempering, can suffer from exponential mixing times -- a natural question is how to leverage additional information, such as a warm start point for each mode, to enable faster mixing across modes. To address this, we introduce Reweighted ALPS (Re-ALPS), a modified version of the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler (ALPS) that dispenses with the Gaussian approximation assumption. We prove the first polynomial-time bound that works in a general setting, under a natural assumption that each component contains significant mass relative to the others when tilted towards the corresponding warm start point. Similarly to ALPS, we define distributions tilted towards a mixture centered at the warm start points, and at the coldest level, use teleportation between warm start points to enable efficient mixing across modes. In contrast to ALPS, our method does not require Hessian information at the modes, but instead estimates component partition functions via Monte Carlo. This additional estimation step is crucial in allowing the algorithm to handle target distributions with more complex geometries besides approximate Gaussian. For the proof, we show convergence results for Markov processes when only part of the stationary distribution is well-mixing and estimation for partition functions for individual components of a mixture. We numerically evaluate our algorithm's mixing performance compared to ALPS on a mixture of heavy-tailed distributions.

### [351] [Causal Inference as Distribution Adaptation: Optimizing ATE Risk under Propensity Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18083)
*Ashley Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper reframes ATE estimation as a domain adaptation problem under distribution shift and introduces the Joint Robust Estimator (JRE) to minimize biases and improve robustness in finite samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal inference methods often impose overly restrictive conditions for consistency, leading to inefficiencies. A unified framework and optimization perspective could address these issues.

Method: The authors reinterpret ATE estimation using a Machine Learning perspective. They define an optimal ATE Risk Function and propose the Joint Robust Estimator (JRE), which incorporates bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification and jointly trains outcome models with propensity scores.

Result: Simulation studies show JRE achieves up to 15% reduction in MSE compared to standard IPWRA when outcome models are misspecified, indicating improved robustness.

Conclusion: JRE offers a more efficient and robust alternative for ATE estimation, especially in finite-sample settings, by leveraging model degrees of freedom and canceling biases structurally between treated and control models.

Abstract: Standard approaches to causal inference, such as Outcome Regression and Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment (IPWRA), are typically derived through the lens of missing data imputation and identification theory. In this work, we unify these methods from a Machine Learning perspective, reframing ATE estimation as a \textit{domain adaptation problem under distribution shift}. We demonstrate that the canonical Hajek estimator is a special case of IPWRA restricted to a constant hypothesis class, and that IPWRA itself is fundamentally Importance-Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization designed to correct for the covariate shift between the treated sub-population and the target population.
  Leveraging this unified framework, we critically examine the optimization objectives of Doubly Robust estimators. We argue that standard methods enforce \textit{sufficient but not necessary} conditions for consistency by requiring outcome models to be individually unbiased. We define the true "ATE Risk Function" and show that minimizing it requires only that the biases of the treated and control models structurally cancel out. Exploiting this insight, we propose the \textbf{Joint Robust Estimator (JRE)}. Instead of treating propensity estimation and outcome modeling as independent stages, JRE utilizes bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification of the propensity score to train outcome models jointly. By optimizing for the expected ATE risk over the distribution of propensity scores, JRE leverages model degrees of freedom to achieve robustness against propensity misspecification. Simulation studies demonstrate that JRE achieves up to a 15\% reduction in MSE compared to standard IPWRA in finite-sample regimes with misspecified outcome models.

*Feng Yu,MD Saifur Rahman Mazumder,Ying Su,Oscar Contreras Velasco*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAEUFS, a robust method for unsupervised feature selection (UFS) using a deep autoencoder to handle nonlinear relationships and outliers, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UFS approaches are limited by linear mapping constraints and assumptions about uniform cluster distributions, which hinder their ability to handle complex relationships and outliers.

Method: The RAEUFS model utilizes a deep autoencoder for nonlinear feature representation and robustness enhancement, coupled with an efficient optimization algorithm.

Result: RAEUFS surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in performance under both clean data and data with outliers.

Conclusion: RAEUFS effectively addresses limitations in traditional UFS methods, offering superior feature selection and clustering capabilities in complex and outlier-prone data scenarios.

Abstract: Effective feature selection is essential for high-dimensional data analysis and machine learning. Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) aims to simultaneously cluster data and identify the most discriminative features. Most existing UFS methods linearly project features into a pseudo-label space for clustering, but they suffer from two critical limitations: (1) an oversimplified linear mapping that fails to capture complex feature relationships, and (2) an assumption of uniform cluster distributions, ignoring outliers prevalent in real-world data. To address these issues, we propose the Robust Autoencoder-based Unsupervised Feature Selection (RAEUFS) model, which leverages a deep autoencoder to learn nonlinear feature representations while inherently improving robustness to outliers. We further develop an efficient optimization algorithm for RAEUFS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art UFS approaches in both clean and outlier-contaminated data settings.

*Shuntuo Xu,Zhou Yu,Jian Huang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying low-dimensional structures in nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction by proposing GenSDR, a method leveraging generative models with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sufficient dimension reduction lack exhaustiveness in identifying lower-dimensional structures at population and sample levels, creating the necessity for improved techniques.

Method: The paper introduces GenSDR, which employs generative models to fully recover central $σ$-field information and ensures sample-level consistency by leveraging deep generative models.

Result: GenSDR effectively recovers sufficient low-dimensional structures empirically and performs well on complex, real-world tasks. It is extended via ensemble techniques for wider applicability.

Conclusion: Generative sufficient dimension reduction is a robust, theoretically validated method for SDR, addressing theoretical and practical limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional sufficient structures in nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) has long been a fundamental yet challenging problem. Most existing methods lack theoretical guarantees of exhaustiveness in identifying lower dimensional structures, either at the population level or at the sample level. We tackle this issue by proposing a new method, generative sufficient dimension reduction (GenSDR), which leverages modern generative models. We show that GenSDR is able to fully recover the information contained in the central $σ$-field at both the population and sample levels. In particular, at the sample level, we establish a consistency property for the GenSDR estimator from the perspective of conditional distributions, capitalizing on the distributional learning capabilities of deep generative models. Moreover, by incorporating an ensemble technique, we extend GenSDR to accommodate scenarios with non-Euclidean responses, thereby substantially broadening its applicability. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the outstanding empirical performance of GenSDR and highlight its strong potential for addressing a wide range of complex, real-world tasks.

TL;DR: The paper presents an interpretable machine learning method by combining GAMs with random Fourier features for better prediction accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the challenge of balancing high predictive performance of black-box models with the need for interpretability.

Method: A mixture-of-GAMs model is introduced, leveraging random Fourier features for local data clustering and integrating this structure into interpretable statistical modeling.

Result: Experiments on datasets like California Housing and NASA Airfoil show improved predictive performance compared to traditional interpretable models.

Conclusion: The authors present a principled approach combining representation learning with interpretable models, balancing transparency with accuracy.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning aims to strike a balance between prediction accuracy and model transparency, particularly in settings where black-box predictive models, such as deep neural networks or kernel-based methods, achieve strong empirical performance but remain difficult to interpret. This work introduces a mixture of generalized additive models (GAMs) in which random Fourier feature (RFF) representations are leveraged to uncover locally adaptive structure in the data. In the proposed method, an RFF-based embedding is first learned and then compressed via principal component analysis. The resulting low-dimensional representations are used to perform soft clustering of the data through a Gaussian mixture model. These cluster assignments are then applied to construct a mixture-of-GAMs framework, where each local GAM captures nonlinear effects through interpretable univariate smooth functions. Numerical experiments on real-world regression benchmarks, including the California Housing, NASA Airfoil Self-Noise, and Bike Sharing datasets, demonstrate improved predictive performance relative to classical interpretable models. Overall, this construction provides a principled approach for integrating representation learning with transparent statistical modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the ability of LLMs in producing correctness proofs for system software, highlighting their potential in assisting the development of verified systems.

Method: The creation of VeruSAGE-Bench benchmark with proof tasks from Verus-verified Rust systems and designing agent systems to test the performance of LLMs like GPT-5, Sonnet 4, and others in verification tasks.

Result: The best LLM-agent combination achieved over 80% completion on VeruSAGE-Bench tasks and over 90% on additional system proof tasks not yet solved by human experts.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant potential in assisting system software verification tasks, and their performance varies based on system and agent optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capability to understand and develop code. However, their capability to rigorously reason about and prove code correctness remains in question. This paper offers a comprehensive study of LLMs' capability to develop correctness proofs for system software written in Rust. We curate a new system-verification benchmark suite, VeruSAGE-Bench, which consists of 849 proof tasks extracted from eight open-source Verus-verified Rust systems. Furthermore, we design different agent systems to match the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs (o4-mini, GPT-5, Sonnet 4, and Sonnet 4.5). Our study shows that different tools and agent settings are needed to stimulate the system-verification capability of different types of LLMs. The best LLM-agent combination in our study completes over 80% of system-verification tasks in VeruSAGE-Bench. It also completes over 90% of a set of system proof tasks not part of VeruSAGE-Bench because they had not yet been finished by human experts. This result shows the great potential for LLM-assisted development of verified system software.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper analyzes tennis serve biomechanics using a physics-based, multi-segment upper-body model to explore kinetic profiles across differing serve types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in understanding the mechanistic reasons behind the motions of elite tennis players, as previous works mostly describe observable features but don't explain why these motions are necessary.

Method: A deterministic, physics-based 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the upper body is applied, using trajectory optimization and analyzing net joint torques through the Principle of Virtual Power.

Result: Simulations show kinematic trajectories look visually similar across serve types, but their underlying kinetic profiles differ drastically. Joint torques, particularly in 'quiet' wrist phases, are essential to counteract gravitational and dynamic effects.

Conclusion: The research provides a first-principles framework linking kinematics and kinetics in tennis serves, offering insight beyond mere imitation of elite techniques.

Abstract: Most conventional studies on tennis serve biomechanics rely on phenomenological observations comparing professional and amateur players or, more recently, on AI-driven statistical analyses of motion data. While effective at describing \textit{what} elite players do, these approaches often fail to explain \textit{why} such motions are physically necessary from a mechanistic perspective. This paper proposes a deterministic, physics-based approach to the tennis serve using a 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the human upper body. Rather than fitting the model to motion capture data, we solve the inverse kinematics problem via trajectory optimization to rigorously satisfy the aerodynamic boundary conditions required for Flat, Slice, and Kick serves. We subsequently perform an inverse dynamics analysis based on the Principle of Virtual Power to compute the net joint torques. The simulation results reveal that while the kinematic trajectories for different serves may share visual similarities, the underlying kinetic profiles differ drastically. A critical finding is that joints exhibiting minimal angular displacement (kinematically ``quiet'' phases), particularly at the wrist, require substantial and highly time-varying torques to counteract gravitational loading and dynamic coupling effects. By elucidating the dissociation between visible kinematics and internal kinetics, this study provides a first-principles framework for understanding the mechanics of the tennis serve, moving beyond simple imitation of elite techniques.

Conclusion: By leveraging lattice properties and introducing novel algorithms, the research contributes to solving constrained min-cut problems effectively, despite NP-hard challenges in some cases.

Abstract: In a capacitated directed graph, it is known that the set of all min-cuts forms a distributive lattice [1], [2]. Here, we describe this lattice as a regular predicate whose forbidden elements can be advanced in constant parallel time after precomputing a max-flow, so as to obtain parallel algorithms for min-cut problems with additional constraints encoded by lattice-linear predicates [3]. Some nice algorithmic applications follow. First, we use these methods to compute the irreducibles of the sublattice of min-cuts satisfying a regular predicate. By Birkhoff's theorem [4] this gives a succinct representation of such cuts, and so we also obtain a general algorithm for enumerating this sublattice. Finally, though we prove computing min-cuts satisfying additional constraints is NP-hard in general, we use poset slicing [5], [6] for exact algorithms with constraints not necessarily encoded by lattice-linear predicates) with better complexity than exhaustive search. We also introduce $k$-transition predicates and strong advancement for improved complexity analyses of lattice-linear predicate algorithms in parallel settings, which is of independent interest.

### [358] [Age of Information with Age-Dependent Server Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18457)
*Nail Akar,Ismail Cosandal,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper studies a single-source, multi-server system for minimizing Age of Information (AoI) using a novel multi-threshold decision policy under cost constraints, leveraging a newly proposed tool called multi-regime absorbing Markov chain (MR-AMC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize AoI and transmission costs in systems with multiple heterogeneous servers, addressing challenges in optimizing update systems with varying performance and expense metrics.

Method: The authors introduce a multi-threshold age-dependent decision policy using the MR-AMC framework to model and analyze AoI distribution and optimize server selection policies. They validate the approach using numerical analysis.

Result: The MR-AMC framework successfully determines AoI and cost distributions, facilitating the derivation of optimal server thresholds and demonstrating benefits of age-dependent policies in multi-server environments.

Conclusion: The study shows that age-dependent server selection policies can effectively minimize AoI and costs using the MR-AMC framework, offering a structured methodology to optimize update systems in discrete-time settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a single-source multi-server generate-at-will discrete-time non-preemptive status update system where update packets are transmitted using {\em only one} of the available servers, according to a server selection policy. In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples.

*Marcos Ortiz,Justin Hill,Collin Overbay,Ingrida Semenec,Frederic Sauve-Hoover,Jim Schwoebel,Joel Shor*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates prompt-to-app AI systems (Replit, Bolt, Firebase Studio), identifying Firebase Studio as the top performer in user trust, visual appeal, and usability. A new benchmark framework for human-centered evaluation was introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating AI systems capable of generating web applications from natural language prompts, as current methods lack human-centered evaluation criteria.

Method: Developed a human-centered benchmark evaluating ease of use, visual appeal, completeness, and trust for AI-generated applications, using 96 diverse prompts and a human-rater study with 1,071 pairwise comparisons.

Result: Firebase Studio outperformed competing platforms in all human-evaluated categories. Bolt performed decently in visual appeal but fell behind in other metrics, and Replit underperformed consistently.

Conclusion: Prompt-to-app AI systems vary in performance, highlighting the importance of human-centered evaluation. The paper provides a benchmark framework and dataset for reproducible future research.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of generating full-stack web applications from natural language prompts ("prompt- to-app") represent a significant shift in software development. However, evaluating these systems remains challenging, as visual polish, functional correctness, and user trust are often misaligned. As a result, it is unclear how existing prompt-to-app tools compare under realistic, human-centered evaluation criteria. In this paper, we introduce a human-centered benchmark for evaluating prompt-to-app systems and conduct a large-scale comparative study of three widely used platforms: Replit, Bolt, and Firebase Studio. Using a diverse set of 96 prompts spanning common web application tasks, we generate 288 unique application artifacts. We evaluate these systems through a large-scale human-rater study involving 205 participants and 1,071 quality-filtered pairwise comparisons, assessing task-based ease of use, visual appeal, perceived completeness, and user trust. Our results show that these systems are not interchangeable: Firebase Studio consistently outperforms competing platforms across all human-evaluated dimensions, achieving the highest win rates for ease of use, trust, visual appeal, and visual appropriateness. Bolt performs competitively on visual appeal but trails Firebase on usability and trust, while Replit underperforms relative to both across most metrics. These findings highlight a persistent gap between visual polish and functional reliability in prompt-to-app systems and demonstrate the necessity of interactive, task-based evaluation. We release our benchmark framework, prompt set, and generated artifacts to support reproducible evaluation and future research in agentic application generation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces SimShadow, using classical shadow tomography for live noise fingerprinting in quantum computing, revealing hardware discrepancies at significantly reduced cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by noise in quantum computing, which hinders the functionality of quantum systems and limits transferability and support in quantum software engineering (QSE).

Method: The method involves utilizing classical shadow tomography in the proposed SimShadow tool to create reference states, estimate deviations, and systematically compare noise fingerprints across quantum platforms.

Result: Initial experiments with SimShadow reveal systematic discrepancies between quantum platforms (e.g., Frobenius distances up to 7.39) while achieving cost reductions of up to 2.5x10^6 times compared to traditional techniques.

Conclusion: SimShadow enables more efficient and accurate noise characterization, opening new opportunities for improvements in noise-aware compilation, debugging, error mitigation, and cross-platform validation in quantum software engineering.

Abstract: Noise is a major bottleneck in today's quantum computing, stemming from decoherence, gate imperfections and other hardware limitations. Accurate noise fingerprints are essential, yet undocumented noise model differences between Quantum Ecosystems undermine core functionality, such as compilation, development and debugging, offering limited transferability and support for quantum software engineering (QSE) tasks. We propose a new research direction: live empirical noise fingerprinting as a lightweight QSE-oriented "noise fingerprinting". Though explored in physics as device-level diagnostics, we reposition them as a QSE paradigm: we propose leveraging classical shadow tomography to enable a new generation of techniques. As a first step, we introduce SimShadow, which prepares reference states, applies shadow-tomography-inspired estimation and constructs deviation fingerprints. Initial experiments uncover systematic discrepancies between platforms (e.g. Frobenius distances up to 7.39) at up to 2.5x10^6 lower cost than traditional methods. SimShadow opens new directions for noise-aware compilation, transpilation, cross-platform validation, error mitigation, and formal methods in QSE.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PalpAid, a tactile sensor system to address the lack of sensory feedback in robot-assisted surgery, improving tumor and tissue identification through innovative pressure and auditory sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgeons in robot-assisted surgeries lack adequate tactile feedback, essential for identifying tumors and tissue boundaries due to the reliance solely on vision.

Method: The authors developed PalpAid, a pneumatic tactile sensor integrated with a microphone and pressure sensor to convert contact force into pressure differential and auditory signals, tested its robustness, and evaluated its performance on hard objects and tissue samples.

Result: PalpAid successfully classified 3D-printed hard objects with varying infills and soft ex vivo tissues, demonstrating its capability to provide actionable tactile sensing.

Conclusion: PalpAid bridges the sensory gap in robot-assisted surgery intelligently, enabling enhanced clinical decision-making for surgical oncology.

Abstract: The tactile properties of tissue, such as elasticity and stiffness, often play an important role in surgical oncology when identifying tumors and pathological tissue boundaries. Though extremely valuable, robot-assisted surgery comes at the cost of reduced sensory information to the surgeon; typically, only vision is available. Sensors proposed to overcome this sensory desert are often bulky, complex, and incompatible with the surgical workflow. We present PalpAid, a multimodal pneumatic tactile sensor equipped with a microphone and pressure sensor, converting contact force into an internal pressure differential. The pressure sensor acts as an event detector, while the auditory signature captured by the microphone assists in tissue delineation. We show the design, fabrication, and assembly of sensory units with characterization tests to show robustness to use, inflation-deflation cycles, and integration with a robotic system. Finally, we show the sensor's ability to classify 3D-printed hard objects with varying infills and soft ex vivo tissues. Overall, PalpAid aims to fill the sensory gap intelligently and allow improved clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel endoscopic method using composite multi-mode fibers (MMF) to enhance fluorescence imaging in deep brain regions, addressing contrast loss issues with spatially selective light rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the constraint of significant contrast loss in holographic endoscopy for densely labeled brain regions due to the lack of out-of-focus fluorescence light rejection, improving imaging in deep brain locations.

Method: The paper utilizes a new composite fiber probe combining graded-index and step-index MMFs to achieve confocal-like fluorescence imaging by spatially resolving signals and rejecting out-of-focus light.

Result: Introduced confocal filtering improves image contrast and resolution, successfully demonstrating enhanced structural and intracellular imaging in the deep mouse brain.

Conclusion: The novel MMF-based approach addresses critical limitations of existing endoscopes, establishing its potential for more precise and deeper in-vivo imaging.

Abstract: Confocal and multi-photon microscopy are widely used for in-vivo fluorescence imaging of biological tissues such as the brain, offering non-invasive access up to ~1 mm depth without major loss in performance. A recently-developed alternative is holographic endoscopy, which exploits controlled light transport through hair-thin optical fibres. With minimal invasiveness, it provides observations at comparable spatial resolution, while extending its applicability to unprecedented depths. It has been used to resolve details of sub-cellular structural connectivity, record neuronal signalling, and monitor blood flow from the deepest locations of the living brain. Yet, its use, particularly in densely labelled brain regions, has so far been constrained by significant contrast loss, primarily due to the absence of a practical mechanism for rejecting out-of-focus fluorescence light -- a capability inherently provided by confocal and multi-photon microscopy. Exploring opportunities in the structure of light modes of different MMF types we identify the possibility of achieving an analogue to confocal fluorescence microscopy through MMF-based endoscopes. Using a novel composite fibre probe that combines graded-index and step-index MMFs, we enable spatially resolved signal collection and selective rejection of out-of-focus light. This confocal filtering significantly enhances image contrast and resolution by suppressing background and off-plane signals. We demonstrate improved imaging performance on fine structural connectivity and intracellular calcium signalling in living mouse brain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the precision of UAV approach and landing operations with arbitrary 3D motion by leveraging sensor data fusion and mathematical modeling.

Method: The authors designed a cascade observer approach. It integrates a complementary filter on SO(3) for attitude reconstruction and a linear Riccati observer for estimating relative position and velocity. Proofs of stability and extensions for specific rotation constraints are provided.

Result: The proposed observer achieves almost global asymptotic and local exponential stability under defined conditions. Extensive simulations confirm its performance.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility and robustness of the proposed observer for relative estimation between a UAV and a moving planar platform, opening avenues for practical UAV applications in complex scenarios.

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of estimating the relative position, orientation, and velocity between a UAV and a planar platform undergoing arbitrary 3D motion during approach and landing. The estimation relies on measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) mounted on both systems, assuming there is a suitable communication channel to exchange data, together with visual information provided by an onboard monocular camera, from which the bearing (line-of-sight direction) to the platform's center and the normal vector of its planar surface are extracted. We propose a cascade observer with a complementary filter on SO(3) to reconstruct the relative attitude, followed by a linear Riccati observer for relative position and velocity estimation. Convergence of both observers is established under persistently exciting conditions, and the cascade is shown to be almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable. We further extend the design to the case where the platform's rotation is restricted to its normal axis and show that its measured linear acceleration can be exploited to recover the remaining unobservable rotation angle. A sufficient condition to ensure local exponential convergence in this setting is provided. The performance of the proposed observers is validated through extensive simulations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Wilcoxon–Wigner random matrices to improve latent structure detection in large symmetric data matrices, offering robust, computationally efficient, and statistically principled methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current methods for detecting latent structure, particularly related to their sensitivity to extreme variation, lack of flexibility, and computational inefficiencies.

Method: The paper systematically studies Wilcoxon–Wigner random matrices, normalized rank statistics derived from independent samples, and establishes asymptotic Gaussian fluctuations for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, enabling parameter-free, distribution-free spectral analysis.

Result: Developed methodology rigorously addresses two hypothesis testing problems (community detection and principal submatrix detection) with supporting numerical examples and contrasts with alternative approaches.

Conclusion: Wilcoxon-Wigner random matrices open up robust, efficient, and theoretically sound paths for analyzing latent structures in data, with broader implications for nonparametrics and multivariate statistics.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of testing for latent structure in large symmetric data matrices. The goal here is to develop statistically principled methodology that is flexible in its applicability, computationally efficient, and insensitive to extreme data variation, thereby overcoming limitations facing existing approaches. To do so, we introduce and systematically study certain symmetric matrices, called Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices, whose entries are normalized rank statistics derived from an underlying independent and identically distributed sample of absolutely continuous random variables. These matrices naturally arise as the matricization of one-sample problems in statistics and conceptually lie at the interface of nonparametrics, multivariate analysis, and data reduction. Among our results, we establish that the leading eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices admit asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations with explicit centering and scaling terms. These asymptotic results enable rigorous parameter-free and distribution-free spectral methodology for addressing two hypothesis testing problems, namely community detection and principal submatrix detection. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. Throughout, our findings are juxtaposed with existing results based on the spectral properties of independent entry symmetric random matrices in signal-plus-noise data settings.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes adversarial impacts on the age of information in IoT systems using a queueing model with closed-form solutions and worst-case bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding age of information (AoI) impact due to adversarial attacks in IoT systems, considering queueing dynamics and resource constraints.

Method: Utilizes an M/G/1/1 system model to incorporate adversarial influences like negative arrivals and service slowdowns. Derives formulas using moment-generating functions and worst-case modeling.

Result: Provides analytical average and peak AoI bounds and verifies the findings through numerical results, showing the effect of limited adversarial resources.

Conclusion: Demonstrates how resource-limited adversarial attacks influence AoI, providing bounds and insights to improve IoT system resilience.

Abstract: Timely updates are critical for real-time monitoring and control applications powered by the Internet of Things (IoT). As these systems scale, they become increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where malicious agents interfere with legitimate transmissions to reduce data rates, thereby inflating the age of information (AoI). Existing adversarial AoI models often assume stationary channels and overlook queueing dynamics arising from compromised sensing sources operating under resource constraints. Motivated by the G-queue framework, this paper investigates a two-source M/G/1/1 system in which one source is adversarial and disrupts the update process by injecting negative arrivals according to a Poisson process and inducing i.i.d. service slowdowns, bounded in attack rate and duration. Using moment generating functions, we then derive closed-form expressions for average and peak AoI for an arbitrary number of sources. Moreover, we introduce a worst-case constrained attack model and employ stochastic dominance arguments to establish analytical AoI bounds. Numerical results validate the analysis and highlight the impact of resource-limited adversarial interference under general service time distributions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer for IoT devices in the Computing Continuum, improving per-client QoS and adapting effectively to dynamic changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As computation moves to the edge to reduce latency and traffic, existing methods fail to emphasize per-client Quality of Service (QoS), which is crucial for latency-sensitive and critical applications.

Method: The authors propose QEdgeProxy, which uses Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) modeling with heterogeneous rewards and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to optimize selecting service instances while maintaining QoS for clients.

Result: The results demonstrate that QEdgeProxy significantly outperforms other methods in terms of per-client QoS satisfaction and adapts well to dynamic changes like load surges and service instance availability.

Conclusion: QEdgeProxy is effective in addressing per-client QoS in dynamic Computing Continuum environments, offering a robust decentralized solution with better performance and adaptability compared to other approaches.

Abstract: As computation shifts from the cloud to the edge to reduce processing latency and network traffic, the resulting Computing Continuum (CC) creates a dynamic environment where it is challenging to meet strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and avoid service instance overload. Existing methods often prioritize global metrics, overlooking per-client QoS, which is crucial for latency-sensitive and reliability-critical applications. We propose QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer that acts as a proxy between IoT devices and service instances in CC. We formulate the load balancing problem as a Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) with heterogeneous rewards, where each load balancer autonomously selects service instances that maximize the probability of meeting its clients' QoS targets by using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate QoS success probabilities. It also incorporates an adaptive exploration mechanism to recover rapidly from performance shifts and non-stationary conditions. We present a Kubernetes-native QEdgeProxy implementation and evaluate it on an emulated CC testbed deployed on a K3s cluster with realistic network conditions and a latency-sensitive edge-AI workload. Results show that QEdgeProxy significantly outperforms proximity-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in per-client QoS satisfaction, while adapting effectively to load surges and instance availability changes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PermuteV, a RISC-V core for edge AI inference that uses hardware defenses to enhance resistance against electromagnetic side-channel attacks, achieving strong security with minimal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to protect edge AI systems, which, despite their advantages such as energy efficiency and privacy, are increasingly vulnerable to side-channel attacks targeting neural network confidentiality.

Method: The method involves designing PermuteV, which implements hardware-accelerated defenses that randomize the execution order of loop iterations to obscure electromagnetic signatures during neural network inference.

Result: The results show that PermuteV effectively defends against electromagnetic side-channel attacks while incurring minimal hardware area and runtime overhead when implemented on FPGA.

Conclusion: PermuteV provides a secure and efficient solution for safeguarding neural network inference on edge devices, balancing performance with strong side-channel attack resistance.

Abstract: Edge AI inference is becoming prevalent thanks to the emergence of small yet high-performance microprocessors. This shift from cloud to edge processing brings several benefits in terms of energy savings, improved latency, and increased privacy. On the downside, bringing computation to the edge makes them more vulnerable to physical side-channel attacks (SCA), which aim to extract the confidentiality of neural network models, e.g., architecture and weight. To address this growing threat, we propose PermuteV, a performant side-channel resistant RISC-V core designed to secure neural network inference. PermuteV employs a hardware-accelerated defense mechanism that randomly permutes the execution order of loop iterations, thereby obfuscating the electromagnetic (EM) signature associated with sensitive operations. We implement PermuteV on FPGA and perform evaluations in terms of side-channel security, hardware area, and runtime overhead. The experimental results demonstrate that PermuteV can effectively defend against EM SCA with minimal area and runtime overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the computational inefficiency of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes on GPUs, particularly for CKKS, and overcoming the memory and parallelism bottlenecks to enable better performance.

Method: The method involves a microarchitectural analysis of CKKS on modern GPUs, identifying issues related to memory bandwidth and kernel hardware utilization, followed by the introduction of Theodosian, a set of memory-aware optimizations and algorithmic improvements.

Result: The optimized approach significantly reduces the bootstrapping latency for CKKS workloads, achieving state-of-the-art performance on GPUs, with substantial runtime and throughput improvements.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that memory-aware optimizations coupled with algorithmic improvements can address key performance bottlenecks in FHE schemes, enhancing their practicality on GPUs.

Abstract: Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables secure computation on encrypted data, mitigating privacy concerns in cloud and edge environments. However, due to its high compute and memory demands, extensive acceleration research has been pursued across diverse hardware platforms, especially GPUs. In this paper, we perform a microarchitectural analysis of CKKS, a popular FHE scheme, on modern GPUs. We focus on on-chip cache behavior, and show that the dominant kernels remain bound by memory bandwidth despite a high-bandwidth L2 cache, exposing a persistent memory wall. We further discover that the overall CKKS pipeline throughput is constrained by low per-kernel hardware utilization, caused by insufficient intra-kernel parallelism. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Theodosian, a set of complementary, memory-aware optimizations that improve cache efficiency and reduce runtime overheads. Our approach delivers consistent speedups across various CKKS workloads. On an RTX 5090, we reduce the bootstrapping latency for 32,768 complex numbers to 15.2ms with Theodosian, and further to 12.8ms with additional algorithmic optimizations, establishing new state-of-the-art GPU performance to the best of our knowledge.

TL;DR: DNA-HHE introduces dual-mode hybrid homomorphic encryption for edge devices, efficiently combining FHE and HHE for better performance in privacy-preserving computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address latency and resource issues of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) on edge devices and reduce cloud-side transciphering overhead in hybrid homomorphic encryption (HHE).

Method: DNA-HHE uses a dual-mode accelerator supporting RNS-CKKS and Rubato within a unified architecture, employs efficient modular reductions, adaptive butterfly units, resource-sharing parallel schemes, and integrates network protocol capacities for reduced latency.

Result: DNA-HHE achieves a latency reduction of 1.09× to 1.56× for edge-side computations and outperforms single-mode designs in computation latency and area efficiency.

Conclusion: DNA-HHE provides the first dual-mode HHE solution with near-network coupling, bringing significant efficiency improvements for edge-side privacy-preserving computations.

Abstract: Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes like RNS-CKKS enable privacy-preserving outsourced computation (PPOC) but suffer from high computational latency and ciphertext expansion, especially on the resource-constrained edge side. Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) mitigates these issues on the edge side by replacing HE with lightweight symmetric encryption for plaintext encryption, such as the Rubato cipher for the HHE variant of RNS-CKKS, yet it introduces transciphering overhead on the cloud. The respective strengths and limitations of FHE and HHE call for a dual-mode HHE solution with flexible algorithm switching ability. This paper presents DNA-HHE, the first dual-mode HHE accelerator with near-network coupling for edge devices. DNA-HHE supports both edge-side RNS-CKKS and Rubato within a unified architecture driven by flexible custom instructions. To realize a compact implementation for the edge side, we propose a DSP-efficient modular reduction design, a compact multi-field-adaptive butterfly unit, and parallel scheduling schemes of Rubato with a high degree of resource sharing. DNA-HHE is designed with network protocol packaging and transmission capacities and directly coupled to the network interface controller, achieving reduced overall latency of edge-side PPOC by 1.09$\times$ to 1.56$\times$. Our evaluations on the ASIC and FPGA platforms demonstrate that DNA-HHE outperforms the state-of-the-art single-mode designs in both edge-side RNS-CKKS and symmetric cipher with better computation latency and area efficiency, while offering dual-mode functionality.

Motivation: Establishing CLTs for ergodic averages of Markov chains is key in probability and its applications, particularly for sampling algorithms used in Bayesian statistics and machine learning, where error analysis of estimators and convergence rates are poorly understood for heavy-tailed distributions.

Method: The paper develops a theory based on drift conditions to establish necessary conditions for ergodic CLTs and lower bounds on convergence rates in general metrics. Specific applications are explored in random walk Metropolis samplers, Langevin algorithms, and other MCMC methods.

Result: Sharp conditions for CLTs validation and convergence rates for MCMC algorithms sampling heavy-tailed targets are presented, with comprehensive analyses of specific samplers.

Conclusion: The insights from the practical drift conditions advance understanding of heavy-tailed distribution sampling, aiding algorithm selection and comparison for applications in Bayesian statistics and machine learning.

Abstract: Establishing central limit theorems (CLTs) for ergodic averages of Markov chains is a fundamental problem in probability and its applications. Since the seminal work~\cite{MR834478}, a vast literature has emerged on the sufficient conditions for such CLTs. To counterbalance this, the present paper provides verifiable necessary conditions for CLTs of ergodic averages of Markov chains on general state spaces. Our theory is based on drift conditions, which also yield lower bounds on the rates of convergence to stationarity in various metrics.
  The validity of the ergodic CLT is of particular importance for sampling algorithms, where it underpins the error analysis of estimators in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Although heavy-tailed sampling is of central importance in applications, the characterisation of the CLT and the convergence rates are theoretically poorly understood for almost all practically-used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In this setting our results provide sharp conditions on the validity of the ergodic CLT and establish convergence rates for large families of MCMC sampling algorithms for heavy-tailed targets. Our study includes a rather complete analyses for random walk Metropolis samplers (with finite- and infinite-variance proposals), Metropolis-adjusted and unadjusted Langevin algorithms and the stereographic projection sampler (as well as the independence sampler). By providing these sharp results via our practical drift conditions, our theory offers significant insights into the problems of algorithm selection and comparison for sampling heavy-tailed distributions (see short YouTube presentations~\cite{YouTube_talk} describing our \href{https://youtu.be/m2y7U4cEqy4}{\underline{theory}} and \href{https://youtu.be/w8I_oOweuko}{\underline{applications}}).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lip synchronization systems for video conferencing face challenges with processing speed and efficiency, especially in multilingual contexts.

Method: The framework uses pipeline-parallel architecture with message-queue-based decoupling. Low-level optimizations like mixed-precision quantization and kernel fusion are implemented to improve efficiency.

Result: The system achieves faster processing, enhanced synchronization stability, and better resource utilization compared to sequential pipelines.

Conclusion: This approach enables low-latency, resource-efficient communication for AIoT systems, expanding potential applications like telemedicine and multilingual kiosks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a parallel and asynchronous Transformer framework designed for efficient and accurate multilingual lip synchronization in real-time video conferencing systems. The proposed architecture integrates translation, speech processing, and lip-synchronization modules within a pipeline-parallel design that enables concurrent module execution through message-queue-based decoupling, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3.1 times compared to sequential approaches. To enhance computational efficiency and throughput, the inference workflow of each module is optimized through low-level graph compilation, mixed-precision quantization, and hardware-accelerated kernel fusion. These optimizations provide substantial gains in efficiency while preserving model accuracy and visual quality. In addition, a context-adaptive silence-detection component segments the input speech stream at semantically coherent boundaries, improving translation consistency and temporal alignment across languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed parallel architecture outperforms conventional sequential pipelines in processing speed, synchronization stability, and resource utilization. The modular, message-oriented design makes this work applicable to resource-constrained IoT communication scenarios including telemedicine, multilingual kiosks, and remote assistance systems. Overall, this work advances the development of low-latency, resource-efficient multimodal communication frameworks for next-generation AIoT systems.

*Chong Liu,Ming Zhang,Fei Li,Hao Zhou,Xiaoshuang Chen,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Introduces Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS) to improve code modularity and compatibility in modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Generative AI approaches generate monolithic and poorly modularized front-end code, lacking compatibility with modern frameworks.

Method: Uses a hierarchical framework combining visual understanding, deduplication, and constraint-based protocols to generate modular, framework-agnostic code.

Result: MLS enhances code reusability and structural integrity, outperforming existing methods across multiple frameworks.

Conclusion: MLS offers a scalable solution to modernize automated front-end engineering, addressing modularity and ecosystem compatibility issues.

Abstract: Automated front-end engineering drastically reduces development cycles and minimizes manual coding overhead. While Generative AI has shown promise in translating designs to code, current solutions often produce monolithic scripts, failing to natively support modern ecosystems like React, Vue, or Angular. Furthermore, the generated code frequently suffers from poor modularity, making it difficult to maintain. To bridge this gap, we introduce Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS), a hierarchical framework that merges visual understanding with structural normalization. Initially, a visual-semantic encoder maps the screen capture into a serialized tree topology, capturing the essential layout hierarchy. Instead of simple parsing, we apply heuristic deduplication and pattern recognition to isolate reusable blocks, creating a framework-agnostic schema. Finally, a constraint-based generation protocol guides the LLM to synthesize production-ready code with strict typing and component props. Evaluations show that MLS significantly outperforms existing baselines, ensuring superior code reusability and structural integrity across multiple frameworks

### [374] [Deep Learning for Primordial $B$-mode Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19577)
*Eric Guzman,Joel Meyers*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning approach to improve the detection of primordial gravitational waves from cosmic microwave background (CMB) signals by addressing complications caused by secondary sources of B-mode polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work lies in the ongoing challenge to isolate and accurately measure primordial gravitational waves through their B-mode polarization signals in the CMB while overcoming contamination from secondary effects like gravitational lensing and astrophysical foregrounds.

Method: The authors propose using a deep learning model called ResUNet-CMB to handle secondary B-mode polarization. This allows for optimal simultaneous estimation and removal of multiple contamination sources, enabling clearer measurements of the B-mode signals.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates that deep learning is a powerful tool to remove secondary B-mode sources and to perform likelihood analyses, yielding nearly optimal and unbiased measurements of primordial gravitational wave amplitudes.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods, such as ResUNet-CMB, provide a promising pathway to advance the accurate detection of primordial gravitational waves by efficiently addressing contamination complexities in the CMB B-mode polarization signal.

Abstract: The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.

### [375] [Snowveil: A Framework for Decentralised Preference Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18444)
*Grammateia Kotsialou*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper introduces Snowveil, a decentralized framework for preference aggregation in large electorates that ensures censorship resistance and convergence to consensus by leveraging a gossip-based protocol and rigorous analysis of aggregation rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of centralized models for aggregating preferences in large groups, especially under constraints like censorship resistance, partial information, and asynchronous communication.

Method: The authors propose a decentralized framework (Snowveil) with the Constrained Hybrid Borda rule, leveraging an iterative, gossip-based protocol to determine collective preferences, backed by an axiomatic analysis ensuring convergence and scalability.

Result: The framework ensures stable convergence to a single or multi-winner setup, validated through analytical methods and extensive simulations, demonstrating scalability at $O(n)$.

Conclusion: Snowveil advances decentralized preference aggregation by enabling censorship-resistant and scalable consensus formation, offering a modular approach applicable to various aggregation rules.

Abstract: Aggregating subjective preferences of a large group is a fundamental challenge in computational social choice, traditionally reliant on central authorities. To address the limitations of this model, this paper introduces Decentralised Preference Discovery (DPD), the problem of determining the collective will of an electorate under constraints of censorship resistance, partial information, and asynchronous communication. We propose Snowveil, a novel framework for this task. Snowveil uses an iterative, gossip-based protocol where voters repeatedly sample the preferences of a small, random subset of the electorate to progressively converge on a collective outcome. We demonstrate the framework's modularity by designing the Constrained Hybrid Borda (CHB), a novel aggregation rule engineered to balance broad consensus with strong plurality support, and provide a rigorous axiomatic analysis of its properties. By applying a potential function and submartingale theory, we develop a multi-level analytical method to show that the system almost surely converges to a stable, single-winner in finite time, a process that can then be iterated to construct a set of winning candidates for multi-winner scenarios. This technique is largely agnostic to the specific aggregation rule, requiring only that it satisfies core social choice axioms like Positive Responsiveness, thus offering a formal toolkit for a wider class of DPD protocols. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis through extensive simulation, validating Snowveil's $O(n)$ scalability. Overall, this work advances the understanding of how a stable consensus can emerge from subjective, complex, and diverse preferences in decentralised systems for large electorates.
