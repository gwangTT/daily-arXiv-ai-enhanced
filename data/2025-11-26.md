### [1] [Using Wearable Devices to Improve Chronic PainTreatment among Patients with Opioid Use Disorder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19577)
*Abhay Goyal,Navin Kumar,Kimberly DiMeola,Rafael Trujillo,Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Christian Poellabauer,Pi Zonooz,Ermonda Gjoni-Markaj,Declan Barry,Lynn Madden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores the use of wearable devices and AI approaches, including LLMs, to monitor and analyze pain spikes in individuals with chronic pain and opioid use disorder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of integrated treatments for chronic pain and opioid use disorder, aiming to leverage wearable devices and AI for analyzing pain variability and its clinical correlates.

Method: The study employed wearable device data and various AI models, including machine learning and large language models, to predict and understand pain spikes.

Result: Machine learning models demonstrated high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, but LLMs showed limited capability in providing actionable insights.

Conclusion: Wearable devices integrated with advanced AI can support personalized care to mitigate risks like opioid relapse, but there’s a need for LLMs to improve their performance in this context.

Abstract: Chronic pain (CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD) are common and interrelated chronic medical conditions. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.

*Ahmed Awadallah,Yash Lara,Raghav Magazine,Hussein Mozannar,Akshay Nambi,Yash Pandya,Aravind Rajeswaran,Corby Rosset,Alexey Taymanov,Vibhav Vineet,Spencer Whitehead,Andrew Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaraGen, a synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. It also presents Fara-7B, a small-scale CUA model trained on this data, performing well against larger models and available open-weight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of large and high-quality datasets for computer use agents (CUAs) has limited their progression compared to the success of large language models (LLMs) with abundant textual data.

Method: The authors developed FaraGen, which generates diverse solutions for web tasks, verifies them with multiple methods, and trains Fara-7B, a model that analyzes screenshots and predicts actions, using this synthetic data.

Result: Fara-7B outperforms similarly sized CUAs on various benchmarks and even competes with larger frontier models. The study introduces WebTailBench, a new benchmark for under-represented web tasks.

Conclusion: Scalable data generation, like FaraGen, can significantly advance small and efficient agentic models like Fara-7B, making them competitive and useful. The authors release Fara-7B and WebTailBench for public access.

Abstract: Progress in computer use agents (CUAs) has been constrained by the absence of large and high-quality datasets that capture how humans interact with a computer. While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models. We are making Fara-7B open-weight on Microsoft Foundry and HuggingFace, and we are releasing WebTailBench.

### [3] [Reducing Latency of LLM Search Agent via Speculation-based Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20048)
*Zixiao Huang,Wen Zeng,Tianyu Fu,Tengxuan Liu,Yizhou Sun,Ke Hong,Xinhao Yang,Chengchun Liu,Yan Li,Quanlu Zhang,Guohao Dai,Zhenhua Zhu,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPAgent to mitigate latency issues in LLM-based search agents by using advanced speculative mechanisms for faster performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents face latency due to serialized reasoning and actions, creating performance bottlenecks during multi-step processes.

Method: SPAgent employs a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism to predict actions without full reasoning and a two-level scheduler to optimize resource allocation.

Result: The framework achieves up to 1.65× speedup compared to traditional methods while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: SPAgent significantly reduces latencies in search agents, proving effective for real-world deployment without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: LLM-based search agents achieve strong performance but suffer from severe latency, as each step requires serialized LLM reasoning followed by action of tool execution. We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.

*Roman Kochnev,Waleed Khalid,Tolgay Atinc Uzun,Xi Zhang,Yashkumar Sanjaybhai Dhameliya,Furui Qin,Chandini Vysyaraju,Raghuvir Duvvuri,Avi Goyal,Dmitry Ignatov,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NNGPT is an open-source framework that leverages large language model (LLM) capabilities to develop self-improving AI for computer vision, utilizing novel pipelines for neural network automation and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle the challenge of building self-improving AI systems by creating an innovative AutoML framework specifically designed for neural network development in computer vision.

Method: Introduces NNGPT: employs a closed-loop process combining generation, assessment, and self-improvement while integrating five LLM-based pipelines such as architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization, and reinforcement learning.

Result: NNGPT achieved key benchmarks, including 73% executability in NN-RAG tests, better RMSE for hyperparameter optimization compared to Optuna, and the generation of over 5,000 validated models. It efficiently reduces resource use while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: NNGPT demonstrates itself as a robust AutoML tool for neural network development, combining diverse techniques into an efficient system with strong and reproducible outcomes, set to be publicly released for wider scientific collaboration.

Abstract: Building self-improving AI systems remains a fundamental challenge in the AI domain. We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, AI-driven AMS design suffers from reliance on high-quality datasets, poor transferability between architectures, and lack of adaptability. There's a need for a more intelligent, adaptive approach akin to human reasoning.

Method: The authors develop HeaRT, an adaptive reasoning engine capable of achieving high accuracy and efficiency by optimizing circuit design in sizing and topology adaptation tasks.

Result: HeaRT achieves reasoning accuracy >97%, Pass@1 performance >98%, demonstrates >3x faster convergence in design tasks, and operates with less computational resource usage compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: HeaRT is an innovative advancement in AMS design automation, proving its potential for adaptive, efficient, and accurate circuit design optimization, akin to human-like reasoning.

Abstract: Conventional AI-driven AMS design automation algorithms remain constrained by their reliance on high-quality datasets to capture underlying circuit behavior, coupled with poor transferability across architectures, and a lack of adaptive mechanisms. This work proposes HeaRT, a foundational reasoning engine for automation loops and a first step toward intelligent, adaptive, human-style design optimization. HeaRT consistently demonstrates reasoning accuracy >97% and Pass@1 performance >98% across our 40-circuit benchmark repository, even as circuit complexity increases, while operating at <0.5x real-time token budget of SOTA baselines. Our experiments show that HeaRT yields >3x faster convergence in both sizing and topology design adaptation tasks across diverse optimization approaches, while preserving prior design intent.

### [6] [FISCAL: Financial Synthetic Claim-document Augmented Learning for Efficient Fact-Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19671)
*Rishab Sharma,Iman Saberi,Elham Alipour,Jie JW Wu,Fatemeh Fard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FISCAL, a framework for generating synthetic data for financial fact-checking, and presents a model called MiniCheck-FISCAL, which achieves high accuracy while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address issues of factual reliability and computational inefficiency in financial applications of large language models.

Method: They propose FISCAL, a modular framework to create financial synthetic datasets (FISCAL-data) and train a lightweight verifier (MiniCheck-FISCAL) using this data.

Result: MiniCheck-FISCAL surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, other open-source models of similar size, and performs comparably to larger models like GPT-4o, showcasing effectiveness in financial fact-checking.

Conclusion: Domain-specific synthetic data coupled with efficient fine-tuning can enable compact models to achieve performance rivaling much larger systems in financial AI, emphasizing scalability and practicality.

Abstract: Financial applications of large language models (LLMs) require factual reliability and computational efficiency, yet current systems often hallucinate details and depend on prohibitively large models. We propose FISCAL (Financial Synthetic Claim-Document Augmented Learning), a modular framework for generating synthetic data tailored to financial fact-checking. Using FISCAL, we generate a dataset called FISCAL-data and use it to train MiniCheck-FISCAL, a lightweight verifier for numerical financial claims. MiniCheck-FISCAL outperforms its baseline, surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo and other open-source peers of similar size, and approaches the accuracy of much larger systems (20x), such as Mixtral-8x22B and Command R+. On external datasets FinDVer and Fin-Fact, it rivals GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 while outperforming Gemini-1.5 Flash. These results show that domain-specific synthetic data, combined with efficient fine-tuning, enables compact models to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and scalability for practical financial AI. The dataset and scripts are available in the project repository (link provided in the paper).

### [7] [Scaling Item-to-Standard Alignment with Large Language Models: Accuracy, Limits, and Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19749)
*Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi,Pooya Razavi,Sonya Powers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study assesses whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the efficiency of educational item-skill alignment tasks while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can alleviate the labor-intensive process of manual item alignment reviews, reducing time and effort without compromising accuracy.

Method: Three LLMs were tested on over 12,000 item-skill pairs for various alignment tasks, such as identifying misalignments, selecting correct skills, and narrowing options through pre-filtering.

Result: LLMs demonstrated high accuracy, with GPT-4o-mini performing particularly well. Pre-filtering strategies improved results significantly, especially in mathematics.

Conclusion: LLMs paired with candidate filtering and human review offer a scalable solution to improve efficiency in educational item alignment without losing precision.

Abstract: As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance. Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.

*Meng Lu,Ran Xu,Yi Fang,Wenxuan Zhang,Yue Yu,Gaurav Srivastava,Yuchen Zhuang,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Charles Fleming,Carl Yang,Zhengzhong Tu,Yang Xie,Guanghua Xiao,Hanrui Wang,Di Jin,Wenqi Shi,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VISTA-Gym, a training platform for enhancing visual reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), and demonstrates its effectiveness with improved performance on multi-step reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current VLMs in reasoning through multi-step visual interactions, despite their strong image understanding capabilities.

Method: VISTA-Gym is a scalable training environment that incorporates diverse real-world multimodal reasoning tasks, standardized visual tools, interaction loops, verifiable feedback signals, and efficient trajectory logging. It enables reinforcement learning for tool-integrated reasoning in VLMs.

Result: The paper presents VISTA-R1, a model trained on VISTA-Gym, which outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines by 9.51%-18.72% on reasoning-intensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks.

Conclusion: VISTA-Gym is demonstrated as an effective platform to enhance tool-integrated reasoning in VLMs, improving their ability to reason through multi-step visual interactions and outperform existing models.

Abstract: While recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong image understanding, their ability to "think with images", i.e., to reason through multi-step visual interactions, remains limited. We introduce VISTA-Gym, a scalable training environment for incentivizing tool-integrated visual reasoning capabilities in VLMs. VISTA-Gym unifies diverse real-world multimodal reasoning tasks (7 tasks from 13 datasets in total) with a standardized interface for visual tools (e.g., grounding, parsing), executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback signals, and efficient trajectory logging, enabling visual agentic reinforcement learning at scale. While recent VLMs exhibit strong text-only reasoning, both proprietary and open-source models still struggle with tool selection, invocation, and coordination. With VISTA-Gym, we train VISTA-R1 to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.

### [9] [NOEM$^{3}$A: A Neuro-Symbolic Ontology-Enhanced Method for Multi-Intent Understanding in Mobile Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19780)
*Ioannis Tzachristas,Aifen Sui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuro-symbolic method for multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents by combining structured intent ontology and compact language models, achieving efficient and accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of accurate and efficient multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents, especially in resource-constrained environments, by incorporating structured symbolic intent into model design.

Method: The approach integrates a structured intent ontology with compact neural language models using retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing, and classification heads. A new metric, Semantic Intent Similarity (SIS), is introduced to evaluate performance based on semantic proximity.

Result: In experiments using MultiWOZ 2.3 dialogue datasets, the method nearly matches GPT-4's accuracy (85% vs 90%) with a significantly smaller energy and memory footprint. Ontology-augmented models demonstrate better grounding and disambiguation.

Conclusion: The study confirms that combining symbolic reasoning with compact models is a viable solution for improving on-device NLU, providing a balance of accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents by integrating a structured intent ontology with compact language models. Our method leverages retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing and optional classification heads to inject symbolic intent structure into both input and output representations. We formalize a new evaluation metric-Semantic Intent Similarity (SIS)-based on hierarchical ontology depth, capturing semantic proximity even when predicted intents differ lexically. Experiments on a subset of ambiguous/demanding dialogues of MultiWOZ 2.3 (with oracle labels from GPT-o3) demonstrate that a 3B Llama model with ontology augmentation approaches GPT-4 accuracy (85% vs 90%) at a tiny fraction of the energy and memory footprint. Qualitative comparisons show that ontology-augmented models produce more grounded, disambiguated multi-intent interpretations. Our results validate symbolic alignment as an effective strategy for enabling accurate and efficient on-device NLU.

### [10] [KOM: A Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence System for Precision Management of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19798)
*Weizhi Liu,Xi Chen,Zekun Jiang,Liang Zhao,Kunyuan Jiang,Ruisi Tang,Li Wang,Mingke You,Hanyu Zhou,Hongyu Chen,Qiankun Xiong,Yong Nie,Kang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents KOM, an AI multi-agent system for automating knee osteoarthritis management, showing improved efficiency and treatment quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in delivering personalized knee osteoarthritis (KOA) care in resource-limited healthcare settings.

Method: Developed KOM, a multi-agent system for automating KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. Conducted benchmark experiments and a simulation study to evaluate performance.

Result: KOM outperformed general-purpose large language models, reducing diagnostic/planning time by 38.5% and improving treatment quality when combined with clinicians.

Conclusion: KOM improves care efficiency and quality for KOA, and its modular design could inform AI systems for other chronic conditions.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects more than 600 million individuals globally and is associated with significant pain, functional impairment, and disability. While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.

### [11] [A Unified Evaluation-Instructed Framework for Query-Dependent Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19829)
*Ke Chen,Yifeng Wang,Hassan Almosapeeh,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust framework for prompt evaluation and optimization, improving dynamic and query-dependent performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods struggle with complex and dynamic scenarios due to reliance on static templates or unstable evaluation metrics. There's a need for a systematic, unified framework to assess and optimize prompt quality.

Method: The authors introduce a multi-dimensional quality scoring evaluator, fine-tuned for execution-free predictions, which guides an optimizer to rewrite prompts in an interpretable and query-dependent way.

Result: The proposed evaluator achieves highest accuracy in predicting prompt performance and the optimization framework outperforms traditional methods across eight datasets and three backbone models.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a unified perspective on prompt quality and demonstrates stable, interpretable improvements across diverse tasks, providing a metric-based, model-agnostic evaluation framework.

Abstract: Most prompt-optimization methods refine a single static template, making them ineffective in complex and dynamic user scenarios. Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks.

### [12] [Reinforcement Learning with $ω$-Regular Objectives and Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19849)
*Dominik Wagner,Leon Witzman,Luke Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses $ω$-regular objectives and constraints to handle safety-performance trade-offs, solving the problem with linear programming and achieving specified thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL often struggles with expressing complex goals beyond scalar rewards and faces reward hacking issues. There is a need to incorporate rich temporal and safety specifications without masking trade-offs between safety and performance.

Method: The authors propose a model-based RL algorithm that uses $ω$-regular objectives and constraints. It employs linear programming to optimize policy while satisfying safety constraints. They also map the problem to constrained limit-average problems with guarantees.

Result: The algorithm ensures policies that adhere to $ω$-regular constraints within thresholds and maximize satisfaction of objectives, addressing both safety requirements and optimization targets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a framework to separately handle safety requirements and optimization goals in RL, improving the expressiveness and reliability of RL systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) commonly relies on scalar rewards with limited ability to express temporal, conditional, or safety-critical goals, and can lead to reward hacking. Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $ω$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.
  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $ω$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $ω$-regular objective while also adhering to $ω$-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Furthermore, we establish a translation to constrained limit-average problems with optimality-preserving guarantees.

*Valerie Lockhart,Dan McCreary,Troy A. Peterson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MicroSims, an AI-driven framework for creating easy-to-customize educational simulations that improve learning outcomes while overcoming cost and complexity barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality educational simulations has traditionally been resource-intensive and required technical expertise, limiting accessibility and widespread adoption.

Method: MicroSims leverage AI for rapid development of lightweight simulations using standardized design patterns, iframe-based embedding for universal and secure integration, and transparent code for easy customization.

Result: The study illustrates that simulations produced using MicroSims enhance conceptual understanding by 30-40% compared to traditional methods while significantly reducing development costs and complexity.

Conclusion: MicroSims democratize simulation-based learning, enhancing accessibility to interactive educational tools and paving the way for AI-powered adaptive learning, thus promoting global educational equity.

Abstract: Educational simulations have long been recognized as powerful tools for enhancing learning outcomes, yet their creation has traditionally required substantial resources and technical expertise. This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems struggle with multimodal data integration, communication adaptability, and providing clear decision insights, hindering efficient collaboration of MEIDs in complex tasks.

Method: CC-EIN integrates multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, semantic-driven task coordination, and Grad-CAM-based decision interpretability.

Result: CC-EIN achieves 95.4% task completion rate and 95% transmission efficiency in simulated post-earthquake rescue scenarios, showing improved semantic consistency and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: CC-EIN addresses existing limitations by enhancing information fusion, communication adaptation, and decision transparency, proving effective for task execution in emergency scenarios.

Abstract: In the 6G era, semantic collaboration among multiple embodied intelligent devices (MEIDs) becomes crucial for complex task execution. However, existing systems face challenges in multimodal information fusion, adaptive communication, and decision interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality. A semantic-driven collaboration mechanism further supports task decomposition and conflict-free coordination among heterogeneous devices. Finally, the InDec module enhances decision transparency through Grad-CAM visualization. Simulation results in post-earthquake rescue scenarios demonstrate that CC-EIN achieves 95.4% task completion rate and 95% transmission efficiency while maintaining strong semantic consistency and energy efficiency.

### [15] [Simulated Self-Assessment in Large Language Models: A Psychometric Approach to AI Self-Efficacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19872)
*Daniel I Jackson,Emma L Jensen,Syed-Amad Hussain,Emre Sezgin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper adapts a psychological scale to test self-assessment in LLMs across tasks, finding a lack of alignment between self-assessed capability and actual task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore if and how large language models (LLMs) can simulate self-assessments and whether this aligns with their actual performance across various tasks.

Method: The researchers modified the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) and applied it to ten LLMs under four task conditions (no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization), analyzing responses for stability and alignment with task performance.

Result: The LLMs displayed stable self-assessment consistency but lower overall self-efficacy scores than human norms. Self-assessment scores often misaligned with actual performance, especially in summarization tasks, and follow-up prompts revealed mild overestimation.

Conclusion: LLMs show inconsistencies between self-perceived capability and task performance, with self-efficacy influenced by reasoning style. Psychometric assessments offer insights into communication patterns but are not reliable performance indicators.

Abstract: Self-assessment is a key aspect of reliable intelligence, yet evaluations of large language models (LLMs) focus mainly on task accuracy. We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations. Psychometric prompting provides structured insight into LLM communication behavior but not calibrated performance estimates.

*Yuanyuan Lin,Xiangyu Ouyang,Teng Zhang,Kaixin Sui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents RPM-MCTS, an approach combining knowledge-retrieval and Monte Carlo Tree Search to enhance code generation by effectively evaluating and correcting intermediate algorithmic steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve code generation in large language models by addressing difficulties in evaluating intermediate steps and reducing errors and computational costs.

Method: Proposes RPM-MCTS which integrates Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model and uses sandbox execution feedback for error correction during code generation.

Result: RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in code generation benchmarks and reduces token consumption by about 15%. Fine-tuning with RPM-MCTS data also boosts model performance.

Conclusion: RPM-MCTS is an effective framework that enhances code generation capabilities while improving efficiency and correctness.

Abstract: Tree search-based methods have made significant progress in enhancing the code generation capabilities of large language models. However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities.

*Qiyao Wei,Edward Morrell,Lea Goetz,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to create benchmarks using knowledge graphs to evaluate semantic similarity methods for large language model outputs across various domains, showing that the performance of these methods varies with domain and semantic variation type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to evaluate semantic similarity between LLM-generated outputs and human references often rely on subjective human judgment, incur high costs, lack domain-specific adaptations, and face ambiguity in equivalence definitions.

Method: The paper proposes using knowledge graphs to generate natural language statement pairs that are semantically similar or dissimilar. Dissimilar pairs are further categorized into sub-types. Benchmarks are generated for four domains: general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, and biology.

Result: Benchmark datasets revealed that the type of semantic variation and the domain significantly influence the performance of different semantic similarity methods. No single method consistently outperformed others.

Conclusion: Semantic similarity assessment methods depend heavily on the specifics of semantic variation and domain context. The findings highlight limitations in the current 'LLM-as-a-judge' approach and suggest the need for domain-aware evaluations.

Abstract: Evaluating the open-form textual responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) typically requires measuring the semantic similarity of the response to a (human generated) reference. However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a taxonomy of hidden failure modes in large language models (LLMs), analyzes evaluation gaps, and offers design principles for reliable LLM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of understanding of LLM behavior in production environments and the need for improved evaluation and monitoring practices.

Method: The authors classify fifteen specific failure modes in LLM applications and analyze production challenges, while proposing design principles for reliable LLM deployment.

Result: The analysis reveals gaps in current evaluation practices and highlights the challenges in stability, reproducibility, and workflow integration of LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper proposes framing LLM reliability as a system-engineering problem, enabling better methodologies for robustness, evaluation, and dependable deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly integrated into decision-support tools, automation workflows, and AI-enabled software systems. However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems. By framing LLM reliability as a system-engineering problem rather than a purely model-centric one, this work provides an analytical foundation for future research on evaluation methodology, AI system robustness, and dependable LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces M$^3$Prune, a framework for hierarchical pruning in multi-modal multi-agent systems, enhancing efficiency and performance while reducing token overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation face challenges of high token overhead and computational cost, limiting their scalability.

Method: The proposed M$^3$Prune framework utilizes intra-modal graph sparsification and inter-modal dynamic topology pruning to reduce redundant edges and token overhead while maintaining task performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show that M$^3$Prune achieves better performance compared to single-agent and existing multi-agent systems, along with a significant reduction in token consumption.

Conclusion: M$^3$Prune successfully balances efficiency and task performance, making multi-modal multi-agent systems more scalable and practical for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (mRAG), which enhance multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with external knowledge, have demonstrated that the collective intelligence of multiple agents can significantly outperform a single model through effective communication. Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.

Method: A vision-language model-based evaluation framework using screenshots and task descriptions to assess task success.

Result: Achieved 73% accuracy in detecting task completion and 27% improvement in task success when feedback is applied.

Conclusion: Vision-based evaluation enhances the reliability and performance of CUAs with effective feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Computer Use Agents (CUAs) are designed to autonomously operate digital interfaces, yet they often fail to reliably determine whether a given task has been completed. We present an autonomous evaluation and feedback framework that uses vision-language models to assess task completion directly from screenshots and task descriptions. Our dataset covers 42 built-in macOS applications and 1,260 human-labeled tasks across a wide range of scenarios. Our framework achieves up to 73 percent accuracy in task success detection and yields an average relative improvement of 27 percent in overall task success when evaluator feedback is applied. These results show that vision-based evaluation can serve as an effective feedback mechanism that improves the reliability and self-correction of autonomous computer-use agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing complexity in remote sensing tasks which demand enhanced reasoning and flexible tool integration.

Method: The authors propose VICoT, a multimodal reasoning framework using a stack-based reasoning structure and modular tool suite, alongside a distillation method for lightweight reasoning models.

Result: VICoT outperformed existing state-of-the-art frameworks on multiple benchmarks, showcasing improved reasoning capabilities and efficiency.

Conclusion: The VICoT framework can deliver significant advancements in remote sensing image analysis, offering transparency, efficiency, and high-quality reasoning.

Abstract: The current remote sensing image analysis task is increasingly evolving from traditional object recognition to complex intelligence reasoning, which places higher requirements on the model's reasoning ability and the flexibility of tool invocation. To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.

We compared the performance of our main algorithm with two other algorithms based on standard clustering techniques (DBSCAN and agglomerative hierarchical), including when some of the data was perturbed. Overall, this article brings together techniques in category theory, graph theory, clustering, reinforcement learning, and data engineering.

*Zhen Zeng,Leijiang Gu,Zhangling Duan,Feng Li,Zenglin Shi,Cees G. M. Snoek,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SMFA, a method for selectively forgetting sensitive information in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) while preserving their overall capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for unlearning sensitive information in MLLMs often compromise general image understanding, thus requiring a more targeted forgetting approach.

Method: The proposed method, SMFA, fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive knowledge with refusals, uses a masking mechanism to prevent interference, and systematically evaluates its performance through a new benchmark, S-MLLMUn Bench.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SMFA achieves both targeted removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of image understanding capabilities, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: SMFA provides precise and controllable unlearning in MLLMs, promoting ethical AI use without impairing general model effectiveness.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve remarkable capabilities but can inadvertently memorize privacy-sensitive information. Although existing unlearning methods can remove such knowledge, they fail to achieve benign forgetting because they often degrade the model's general image understanding performance. To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding. Extensive experiments show that, unlike prior methods, SMFA achieves precise and controllable unlearning while maintaining the model's foundational image understanding.

Motivation: The motivation is to design an effective framework to improve stability, reliability, and performance in commonsense persona-grounded dialogues for both GPU and API tracks.

Method: The framework uses dynamic tool pruning, persona clipping, parameter normalization, function merging, and refined prompts for input optimization. GRPO training, a reinforcement learning technique, is applied to enhance the GPU track's performance.

Result: Their approach ranked first in Task 2 API, second in Task 1 API, and third in both Task 3 API and GPU track.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance and reliability in commonsense persona-grounded dialogues, validated by competitive results in CPDC 2025.

Abstract: This report presents the solution and results of our team MSRA\_SC in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC 2025). We propose a simple yet effective framework that unifies improvements across both GPU Track and API Track. Our method centers on two key components. First, Context Engineering applies dynamic tool pruning and persona clipping for input compression, combined with post-processing techniques such as parameter normalization and function merging. Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals. This mitigates small-sample overfitting and significantly enhances task-oriented dialogue performance. In the final evaluation, our team ranks 1st in Task 2 API, 2nd in Task 1 API, and 3rd in both Task 3 API and GPU track, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: CostNav is a new benchmark system that evaluates navigation agents based on economic viability in addition to task success, revealing that current navigation solutions are often not commercially sustainable due to high collision-induced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between navigation research metrics and real-world commercial viability for autonomous delivery robots.

Method: CostNav models the economic lifecycle of navigation agents, incorporating industry-derived parameters such as hardware, energy, training, and maintenance costs, and assesses commercial deployment via comprehensive cost-revenue analyses.

Result: Baseline agents fail to achieve commercial viability due to collision costs dominating (99.7%) total expenses, demonstrating a loss of $30.009 per run and showing a lack of a finite break-even point.

Conclusion: CostNav emphasizes the importance of designing navigation systems optimized for economic deployment, particularly focusing on collision avoidance to reduce costs and achieve profitability.

Abstract: Existing navigation benchmarks focus on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability -- critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots. We introduce \emph{CostNav}, a \textbf{Micro-Navigation Economic Testbed} that evaluates embodied agents through comprehensive cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\% SLA compliance but is \emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods which produce unrealistic or impractical modifications by ignoring complex real-world dependencies.

Method: The paper proposes the DANCE method, incorporating data-driven or expert-provided constraints to generate diverse, plausible, and actionable counterfactual explanations.

Result: DANCE performs better on 140 public datasets, generating meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals compared to existing methods, and is validated with real-world data from a major email marketing company.

Conclusion: DANCE effectively produces actionable and realistic counterfactuals while addressing key limitations of existing models and aligning them with real-world constraints.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance the actionable interpretability of machine learning models by identifying the minimal changes required to achieve a desired outcome of the model. However, existing methods often ignore the complex dependencies in real-world datasets, leading to unrealistic or impractical modifications. Motivated by cybersecurity applications in the email marketing domain, we propose a method for generating Diverse, Actionable, and kNowledge-Constrained Explanations (DANCE), which incorporates feature dependencies and causal constraints to ensure plausibility and real-world feasibility of counterfactuals. Our method learns linear and nonlinear constraints from data or integrates expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible and actionable. By maintaining consistency with feature relationships, the method produces explanations that align with real-world constraints. Additionally, it balances plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, effectively addressing key limitations in existing algorithms. The work is developed based on a real-life case study with Freshmail, the largest email marketing company in Poland and supported by a joint R&D project Sendguard. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation using 140 public datasets, which highlights its ability to generate meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals that outperform other existing approaches based on widely used metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMoG, a framework for schema matching in medical data integration using simple 1-hop SPARQL queries for enhanced explainability and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to resolve schema mismatches in medical data integration, where EHR systems require alignment with standard models like OMOP CDM. Traditional LLM-based methods are limited by hallucination and outdated knowledge, while current KG-augmented approaches are inefficient or resource-intensive.

Method: The proposed SMoG framework uses an iterative strategy with simple 1-hop SPARQL queries based on successful KGQA approaches. This avoids the inefficiencies of complex multi-hop or vector-based methods, directly querying SPARQL endpoints for results.

Result: SMoG achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on real-world medical datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing storage requirements and enhancing explainability.

Conclusion: SMoG provides an efficient, reliable, and explainable approach to schema matching in medical data integration, leveraging knowledge graphs without relying on computationally-intensive methods.

Abstract: Schema matching is a critical task in data integration, particularly in the medical domain where disparate Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems must be aligned to standard models like OMOP CDM. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in schema matching, they suffer from hallucination and lack of up-to-date domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution by providing structured, verifiable knowledge. However, existing KG-augmented LLM approaches often rely on inefficient complex multi-hop queries or storage-intensive vector-based retrieval methods. This paper introduces SMoG (Schema Matching on Graph), a novel framework that leverages iterative execution of simple 1-hop SPARQL queries, inspired by successful strategies in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). SMoG enhances explainability and reliability by generating human-verifiable query paths while significantly reducing storage requirements by directly querying SPARQL endpoints. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that SMoG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness and efficiency in KG-augmented schema matching.

*Shashank Kirtania,Param Biyani,Priyanshu Gupta,Yasharth Bajpai,Roshni Iyer,Sumit Gulwani,Gustavo Soares*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BREW, a framework to optimize LLM-based agents by using structured experiential memory for efficient task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to train LLM-based agents are computationally expensive and lack interpretability and adaptability.

Method: The authors propose BREW, which constructs and refines a knowledge base (KB) using task graders, behavior rubrics, and state-space search for robust learning.

Result: BREW achieves a 10-20% improvement in task precision, 10-15% fewer tool calls, and faster execution on benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: BREW offers a modular and interpretable approach to agent optimization, providing an alternative to static context by using a structured, controllable KB for enhancing behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly applied to tasks requiring structured reasoning, tool use, and environmental adaptation, such as data manipulation, multistep planning, and computer-use automation. However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $τ^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reverse-engineering network weights falter when the teacher network has more parameters than its training data due to student overfitting.

Method: The authors introduce tailor-made data augmentation techniques to better sample the teacher network's hidden layer representations during the teacher-student setup.

Result: Their new augmentation methods enable recovery of networks with up to 100 times more parameters than available training data, surpassing the performance of standard augmentation methods.

Conclusion: The tailored augmentations significantly extend the range of recoverable network sizes, advancing the state-of-the-art for reverse-engineering network weights.

Abstract: Network weights can be reverse-engineered given enough informative samples of a network's input-output function. In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem. We design new data augmentation techniques tailored to better sample the representational space of the network's hidden layers. With our augmentations we extend the state-of-the-art range of recoverable network sizes. To test their scalability, we show that we can recover networks of up to 100 times more parameters than training data-points.

*Patrick Kenny*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper disentangles active inference from the Free Energy Principle, proposing an alternative optimization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the relationship between active inference and the Free Energy Principle and avoid reliance on expected free energy in modeling cognition.

Method: The authors reformulated the active inference framework into divergence minimization problems, solvable through standard mean field methods.

Result: The proposed perception/action divergence method matches traditional variational free energy for perception, and deviates with an entropy regularizer for action.

Conclusion: Active inference can be implemented without expected free energy, providing an alternative, constrained divergence minimization approach.

Abstract: We seek to clarify the concept of active inference by disentangling it from the Free Energy Principle. We show how the optimizations that need to be carried out in order to implement active inference in discrete state spaces can be formulated as constrained divergence minimization problems which can be solved by standard mean field methods that do not appeal to the idea of expected free energy. When it is used to model perception, the perception/action divergence criterion that we propose coincides with variational free energy. When it is used to model action, it differs from an expected free energy functional by an entropy regularizer.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VibraVerse, a dataset that aligns 3D geometry, physical attributes, and acoustic signals, enabling causally interpretable multimodal learning. It also proposes the CLASP framework for cross-modal alignment, achieving superior generalization and accuracy across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of physical consistency and causal interpretation in current multimodal learning frameworks by grounding models in physical laws related to geometry and acoustics.

Method: The authors created VibraVerse, a large dataset aligning 3D geometry, physical properties, modal parameters, and acoustic signals, and proposed CLASP, a contrastive learning framework ensuring physically consistent cross-modal alignment.

Result: The framework achieves better accuracy, interpretability, and generalization than existing models in tasks like geometry-to-sound prediction and sound-guided shape reconstruction.

Conclusion: VibraVerse and the CLASP framework establish a new benchmark for physically consistent multimodal learning and provide tools for sound-guided embodied perception. VibraVerse will be open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: DRAFT-RL, a framework integrating multi-draft reasoning into multi-agent RL, enhances reasoning by generating and refining multiple solution drafts evaluated by peers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent reflection frameworks for LLMs suffer from limited reasoning exploration and reliance on single-shot responses, which hinders robust problem-solving.

Method: The method introduces DRAFT-RL, where agents create multiple solution drafts per query. A reward model and peer evaluation refine drafts, and actor-critic learning optimizes reasoning strategies.

Result: DRAFT-RL improves reasoning accuracy and convergence speed significantly in tasks like code synthesis, symbolic math, and knowledge-intensive QA, outperforming existing solutions.

Conclusion: Incorporating draft-based reasoning into multi-agent RL fosters multi-path exploration, peer-guided refinement, and better performance, enhancing LLM problem-solving and interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multi-step reasoning and problem-solving.Recent works introduce multi-agent reflection frameworks where multiple LLM agents critique and refine each other's outputs using reinforcement learning (RL). However, these approaches often rely on single-shot responses and lack structural diversity in reasoning exploration. In this paper, we propose DRAFT-RL, a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Draft (CoD) reasoning into multi-agent RL training. Instead of generating single responses, each agent produces multiple drafts per query, which are then evaluated by peer agents and a learned reward model to identify the most promising trajectory. These selected drafts are used to refine future reasoning strategies through actor-critic learning.DRAFT-RL enables explicit multi-path exploration, peer-guided reflection, and reward-aligned selection, resulting in more robust and interpretable LLM agent behavior. We evaluate our method on complex reasoning tasks including code synthesis, symbolic math, and knowledge-intensive QA,demonstrating that DRAFT-RL outperforms existing reflective and RL-based agents by significant margins in both accuracy and convergence speed

### [33] [Universe of Thoughts: Enabling Creative Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20471)
*Yuto Suzuki,Farnoush Banaei-Kashani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Universe of Thoughts (UoT) framework to facilitate creative reasoning using Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing gaps in existing problem-solving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving but lack creativity, which is crucial for domains like drug discovery and business strategies.

Method: The paper introduces a computational framework inspired by cognitive science principles, defining three paradigms for creative reasoning: combinational, exploratory, and transformative. The Universe of Thoughts (UoT) implements these processes using LLMs.

Result: UoT demonstrates superior performance in creative reasoning compared to state-of-the-art techniques and commercial models, evaluated through novel tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: UoT effectively enables systematic creative problem-solving, expanding LLMs' capabilities to address tasks requiring creativity and innovation.

Abstract: Reasoning based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention due to outstanding performance of these models in mathematical and complex logical tasks. Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \textit{combinational}, \textit{exploratory}, and \textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics. With a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning techniques as well as representative commercial models with reasoning capability, we show that UoT demonstrates superior performance in creative reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies privacy risks in synthetic network traffic data generated by various models, introducing privacy metrics and evaluating vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in synthetic network traffic data and understand the extent of sensitive information leakage.

Method: Developed a set of privacy metrics combining standard attacks and network-specific attributes, systematically evaluating generative models.

Result: Revealed high variability in privacy risks, with MIA success rates up to 88% and full recovery of identifiers in some cases.

Conclusion: Provides guidance for designing generative models with minimal privacy leakage to support safer synthetic traffic generation.

Abstract: To address the scarcity and privacy concerns of network traffic data, various generative models have been developed to produce synthetic traffic. However, synthetic traffic is not inherently privacy-preserving, and the extent to which it leaks sensitive information, and how to measure such leakage, remain largely unexplored. This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets. MIA success ranges from 0% to 88%, and up to 100% of network identifiers can be recovered from generated traffic, highlighting serious privacy vulnerabilities. We further identify key factors that significantly affect attack outcomes, including training data diversity and how well the generative model fits the training data. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing and deploying generative models that minimize privacy leakage, establishing a foundation for safer synthetic network traffic generation.

*Yuto Suzuki,Paul Awolade,Daniel V. LaBarbera,Farnoush Banaei-Kashani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel AI framework named FRAGMENTA optimizes molecule generation for drug discovery, addressing dataset limitations and expert collaboration challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve molecule generation for drug discovery by addressing small dataset challenges, limited diversity in fragment-based models, and inefficient tuning processes requiring indirect collaboration.

Method: The proposed FRAGMENTA framework incorporates a generative model using Q-learning for optimized fragmentation and generation, alongside an AI system enabling direct conversational feedback for iterative refinement.

Result: FRAGMENTA nearly doubled the identification of high-scoring molecules in real-world cancer drug discovery compared to baselines, showcasing superior agentic AI tuning capabilities.

Conclusion: FRAGMENTA demonstrates the potential to transform drug discovery by autonomously optimizing molecule generation and refining models with minimal human intervention, significantly outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Molecule generation using generative AI is vital for drug discovery, yet class-specific datasets often contain fewer than 100 training examples. While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a "vocabulary selection" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines. Furthermore, the fully autonomous Agent-Agent system outperformed traditional Human-Human tuning, demonstrating the efficacy of agentic tuning in capturing expert intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific, high-stakes certification tasks like the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination.

Method: The study tested the two models on 2,306 text-only, multiple-choice questions from official exams and public resources. Pearson's Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to analyze performance against each dataset.

Result: DeepSeek-R1 showed significantly higher accuracy (90.0%) compared to ChatGPT-4o (76.1%), particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis questions. However, year-by-year performance differences were not statistically significant.

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1's better alignment with the exam highlights the value of domain-specific LLMs. Nonetheless, human oversight is essential in sensitive, legally significant contexts.

Abstract: Background: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into digital health education and assessment workflows, their capabilities in supporting high-stakes, domain-specific certification tasks remain underexplored.In China, the national pharmacist licensure exam serves as a standardized benchmark for evaluating pharmacists' clinical and theoretical competencies. Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam. These findings suggest that domain-specific models warrant further investigation for this context, while also reinforcing the necessity of human oversight in legally and ethically sensitive contexts.

Conclusion: Integrating structured knowledge with VLMs significantly enhances factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, laying groundwork for advancing multimodal systems to be more reliable and knowledgeable.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are powerful generative tools but often produce factually inaccurate outputs due to a lack of robust reasoning capabilities. While extensive research has been conducted on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such efforts remain underexplored in VLMs, where the challenge is compounded by the need to bridge multiple modalities seamlessly. This work introduces a framework for knowledge-guided reasoning in VLMs, leveraging structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image-captioning task to illustrate our framework. Our approach enables systematic reasoning across multiple steps, including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement. We evaluate the framework using hierarchical, triple-based and bullet-point based knowledge representations, analyzing their effectiveness in factual accuracy and logical inference. Empirical results show that our approach improves factual accuracy by approximately 31% on preliminary experiments on a curated dataset of mixtures from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual captions and Coco captions revealing key insights into reasoning patterns and failure modes. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge for advancing reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for more reliable and knowledgable multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS) to model and propagate trust in neural networks, focusing on reliability under adversarial and degraded conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to assess reliability and uncertainty; safety-critical AI applications require improved trust assessment methods.

Method: The proposed framework utilizes Subjective Logic to propagate trust through Trust Nodes and Trust Functions, alongside mechanisms like Parameter Trust Update and Inference-Path Trust Assessment for instance-specific evaluations.

Result: PaTAS demonstrated effectiveness in identifying adversarial inputs, exposing reliability gaps, and generating interpretable trust estimates in various datasets, including poisoned and uncertain data scenarios.

Conclusion: PaTAS enhances trust reasoning in neural networks, offering a systematic tool for evaluating model reliability, complementing accuracy metrics, and addressing challenges in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Trustworthiness has become a key requirement for the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in safety-critical applications. Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the \emph{Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS)}, a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through \emph{Trust Nodes} and \emph{Trust Functions} that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a \emph{Parameter Trust Update} mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an \emph{Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA)} method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a principled foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable LLC prefetcher that effectively handles irregular memory access patterns, achieving significant performance improvements in graph applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prefetchers struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are common in modern applications, particularly graph workloads.

Method: The Pickle Prefetcher trades complex prediction hardware for software programmability, allowing custom prefetching strategies to adapt to diverse access patterns while optimizing resource usage.

Result: Evaluations using gem5 simulations demonstrate that Pickle Prefetcher achieves up to 1.74x speedup for graph applications and provides considerable benefits when combined with private cache prefetchers.

Conclusion: The programmable Pickle Prefetcher enhances memory performance for workloads with irregular access patterns, offering an effective alternative to traditional prediction-based approaches.

Abstract: Modern high-performance architectures employ large last-level caches (LLCs). While large LLCs can reduce average memory access latency for workloads with a high degree of locality, they can also increase latency for workloads with irregular memory access patterns. Prefetchers are widely used to reduce memory latency by prefetching data into the cache hierarchy before it is accessed by the core. However, existing prediction-based prefetchers often struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are especially prevalent in modern applications. This paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable and scalable LLC prefetcher designed to handle independent irregular memory access patterns effectively. Instead of relying on static heuristics or complex prediction algorithms, Pickle Prefetcher allows software to define its own prefetching strategies using a simple programming interface without expanding the instruction set architecture (ISA). By trading the logic complexity of hardware prediction for software programmability, Pickle Prefetcher can adapt to a wide range of access patterns without requiring extensive hardware resources for prediction. This allows the prefetcher to dedicate its resources to scheduling and issuing timely prefetch requests. Graph applications are an example where the memory access pattern is irregular but easily predictable by software. Through extensive evaluations of the Pickle Prefetcher on gem5 full-system simulations, we demonstrate tha Pickle Prefetcher significantly outperforms traditional prefetching techniques. Our results show that Pickle Prefetcher achieves speedups of up to 1.74x on the GAPBS breadth-first search (BFS) implementation over a baseline system. When combined with private cache prefetchers, Pickle Prefetcher provides up to a 1.40x speedup over systems using only private cache prefetchers.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: R3A, a framework using Large Language Models (LLM), significantly improves automatic RTL program repair, fixing 90.6% of bugs with high reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automatic program repair methods are limited by fixed templates, while random outcomes in RTL repair from LLMs remain problematic.

Method: R3A employs a stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method for bug patch generation and a multi-agent fault localization to improve precision and reliability.

Result: Experiments indicate that R3A fixes 90.6% of bugs in an RTL-repair dataset and performs 45% better than alternatives while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate.

Conclusion: R3A demonstrates a highly reliable approach to RTL program repair, outperforming traditional and LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Repairing RTL bugs is crucial for hardware design and verification. Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability.

### [45] [Efficient Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs via LLM Planning and Embedding-Guided Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19648)
*Manil Shrestha,Edward Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces two efficient and verifiable algorithms for multi-hop question answering on knowledge graphs, achieving significant improvements in speed and accuracy without relying heavily on large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and lack of verifiable grounding in existing multi-hop question answering systems that rely on large language models.

Method: Developed two algorithms: 1) LLM-Guided Planning, which uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, ensuring knowledge graph grounding, and 2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search, eliminating LLM calls using a lightweight edge scorer with fused text and graph embeddings.

Result: Significant performance and efficiency: (1) LLM-Guided Planning achieves micro-F1 > 0.90 with verifiable answers from knowledge graphs. (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search achieves over 100x speedup with competitive accuracy. A 4B-parameter knowledge-distilled model matches large-model performance without API cost.

Conclusion: Structured planning based on symbolic and learned representations ensures verifiable and efficient multi-hop reasoning, negating the need for massive models during inference.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering over knowledge graphs remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible reasoning paths. Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.

### [46] [Can LLMs Faithfully Explain Themselves in Low-Resource Languages? A Case Study on Emotion Detection in Persian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19719)
*Mobina Mehrazar,Mohammad Amin Yousefi,Parisa Abolfath Beygi,Behnam Bahrak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the faithfulness of explanations generated by large language models (LLMs) in Persian emotion classification, highlighting their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of LLM-generated explanations in low-resource languages, focusing on faithfulness in reasoning.

Method: The researchers compare LLM explanation-derived influential words with human annotations and test two prompting strategies based on token-level log-probabilities.

Result: LLMs perform well in classification but generate explanations that often diverge from human reasoning, agreeing more with themselves than humans.

Conclusion: Current explanation methods and metrics are insufficient, necessitating improved approaches for LLM reliability in low-resource contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate self-explanations alongside their predictions, a practice that raises concerns about the faithfulness of these explanations, especially in low-resource languages. This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments. These results highlight the limitations of current explanation methods and metrics, emphasizing the need for more robust approaches to ensure LLM reliability in multilingual and low-resource contexts.

### [47] [Comparative Analysis of LoRA-Adapted Embedding Models for Clinical Cardiology Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19739)
*Richard J. Young,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares ten transformer-based embedding models for cardiology, identifying encoder-only models like BioLinkBERT as the most efficient and performant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the most effective and computationally efficient transformer-based text embedding models for cardiology-specific applications.

Method: Ten transformer models were fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on 106,535 cardiology text pairs from medical textbooks, and their performance and efficiency were evaluated.

Result: Encoder-only models, especially BioLinkBERT, outperformed larger decoder-based models in domain-specific performance while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Smaller, encoder-based models can outperform larger language models in domain-specific contexts like cardiology, offering insights for clinical NLP development.

Abstract: Domain-specific text embeddings are critical for clinical natural language processing, yet systematic comparisons across model architectures remain limited. This study evaluates ten transformer-based embedding models adapted for cardiology through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on 106,535 cardiology text pairs derived from authoritative medical textbooks. Results demonstrate that encoder-only architectures, particularly BioLinkBERT, achieve superior domain-specific performance (separation score: 0.510) compared to larger decoder-based models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. The findings challenge the assumption that larger language models necessarily produce better domain-specific embeddings and provide practical guidance for clinical NLP system development. All models, training code, and evaluation datasets are publicly available to support reproducible research in medical informatics.

### [48] [What does it mean to understand language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19757)
*Colton Casto,Anna Ivanova,Evelina Fedorenko,Nancy Kanwisher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Understanding language involves engaging other brain regions beyond the core language system to compute perceptual, motor, and knowledge-based representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore mechanisms of deep language understanding and clarify the role of other brain systems beyond core language processing.

Method: Review of cognitive neuroscience evidence to build a hypothesis about language understanding integrating core and non-core brain systems.

Result: Provides conceptual foundation and methodological approaches to test the hypothesis.

Conclusion: Deep language understanding is achieved through the integration of information within broader brain systems, opening further research paths.

Abstract: Language understanding entails not just extracting the surface-level meaning of the linguistic input, but constructing rich mental models of the situation it describes. Here we propose that because processing within the brain's core language system is fundamentally limited, deeply understanding language requires exporting information from the language system to other brain regions that compute perceptual and motor representations, construct mental models, and store our world knowledge and autobiographical memories. We review the existing evidence for this hypothesis, and argue that recent progress in cognitive neuroscience provides both the conceptual foundation and the methods to directly test it, thus opening up a new strategy to reveal what it means, cognitively and neurally, to understand language.

### [49] [Gender Bias in Emotion Recognition by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19785)
*Maureen Herbert,Katie Sun,Angelica Lim,Yasaman Etesam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines gender biases in emotional theory of mind for large language models (LLMs) and explores debiasing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate fairness in LLMs by investigating gender biases in how they infer emotions from context, given their expanding role in daily use.

Method: The authors studied LLM's emotional bias by providing scenarios and questioning their emotional inference. They tested and compared various debiasing interventions, focusing on training-based solutions versus prompt engineering.

Result: Results highlight gender bias in emotional inferences by LLMs and show that training interventions significantly reduce biases, while prompt-based methods are less effective.

Conclusion: Meaningful reduction of bias in LLMs requires training-based approaches rather than only implementing prompt engineering.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their growing integration into daily life underscore the importance of evaluating and ensuring their fairness. In this work, we examine fairness within the domain of emotional theory of mind, investigating whether LLMs exhibit gender biases when presented with a description of a person and their environment and asked, "How does this person feel?". Furthermore, we propose and evaluate several debiasing strategies, demonstrating that achieving meaningful reductions in bias requires training based interventions rather than relying solely on inference-time prompt-based approaches such as prompt engineering.

TL;DR: This paper introduces NRC VAD Lexicon v2, which includes human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k multiword expressions (MWEs) and expanded coverage of individual words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand emotional association ratings to include MWEs and increase coverage of common unigrams since 2018.

Method: Human ratings were collected for valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions in MWEs and additional words, and the reliability of these associations was analyzed.

Result: The NRC VAD Lexicon v2 includes entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, demonstrating reliable emotional associations and insights into emotional compositionality.

Conclusion: The updated lexicon enables diverse research across NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences.

Abstract: Factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Existing lexicons such as the NRC VAD Lexicon, published in 2018, include VAD association ratings for words. Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences.

*Koena Ronny Mabokela,Tim Schlippe,Mpho Raborife,Turgay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automatic sentiment labelling method for low-resource African languages (Sepedi, Setswana) using emojis and sentiment-bearing words, achieving an average accuracy of 66-69%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African languages lack digital resources for sentiment analysis, and manual text labelling is expensive and time-intensive, necessitating efficient automated methods.

Method: The method leverages sentiment-bearing emojis and words for automatically generating sentiment labels, tested on tweets in English, Sepedi, and Setswana from the SAfriSenti corpus.

Result: The system achieved sentiment labelling accuracy of 66% (English), 69% (Sepedi), and 63% (Setswana), requiring only 34% of labels to be manually corrected.

Conclusion: The automatic sentiment labelling method demonstrates effectiveness, reducing manual effort and advancing sentiment analysis for low-resource languages like Sepedi and Setswana.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a helpful task to automatically analyse opinions and emotions on various topics in areas such as AI for Social Good, AI in Education or marketing. While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.

*Shi-Wei Dai,Yan-Wei Shie,Tsung-Huan Yang,Lun-Wei Ku,Yung-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces PersonaPulse, a method to optimize prompts for realistic personality expressions in LLMs, improving user interactions with AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inducing personality traits in LLMs are limited as they do not optimize prompts for maximal personality expression.

Method: The study introduces PersonaPulse, a framework that dynamically optimizes role-play prompts using inherent personality trait knowledge of LLMs and situational response benchmarks.

Result: PersonaPulse-generated prompts outperform previous methods and reveal relationships between model size and personality modeling, noting partial control over trait expression by pausing the optimization.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization is crucial to improving personality expression in LLMs, enhancing user-AI interactions and providing direction for future adaptive AI research.

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be an effective way to create more engaging and enjoyable user-AI interactions. While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process. These findings underscore the importance of prompt optimization in shaping personality expression within LLMs, offering valuable insights for future research on adaptive AI interactions.

### [53] [A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models with RAG-enabled Dynamic Prompting for Medical Error Detection and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19858)
*Farzad Ahmed,Joniel Augustine Jerome,Meliha Yetisgen,Özlem Uzuner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates prompting strategies for large language models in medical error detection and correction tasks, finding retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) outperforms static and zero-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address factual, diagnostic, and management errors in clinical documentation, which can compromise patient safety.

Method: The study evaluates nine instruction-tuned LLMs on the MEDEC dataset using zero-shot, static prompting, and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting for error processing tasks.

Result: RDP reduced false-positive rates by about 15%, improved recall by 5–10% in error sentence detection, and provided more accurate error corrections compared to other strategies.

Conclusion: RDP enhances error detection accuracy, lowers false positives, and improves medical error correction reliability across various LLMs.

Abstract: Objective: Clinical documentation contains factual, diagnostic, and management errors that can compromise patient safety. Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.
  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.
  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.
  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting. Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.

TL;DR: The paper presents AppSelectBench, a benchmark for evaluating application selection in Computer Using Agents (CUAs), addressing their ability to choose appropriate applications for diverse user tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate and improve the fundamental capability of application selection in CUAs, essential for initializing the correct environment, avoiding orchestration confusion, and focusing on relevant contexts efficiently.

Method: The authors developed AppSelectBench, a benchmark with a task generation pipeline that produces diverse user intents, and comprehensive unified evaluation protocols (random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented settings) for over 100 applications and 100k realistic tasks.

Result: Experimental results revealed that existing large language models, whether open-source or closed-source, show varying capabilities in cross-application reasoning but struggle with consistent application choices.

Conclusion: AppSelectBench is established as a foundational resource for studying and advancing application-level reasoning in CUAs, addressing an essential yet underexplored capability.

Abstract: Computer Using Agents (CUAs) are increasingly equipped with external tools, enabling them to perform complex and realistic tasks. For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2R is a framework addressing issues in decoder-only rerankers for domain-specific fields via innovative methods, proving to be a robust and modular solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist models used in high-stakes domains like finance and law miss critical nuances, and naive fine-tuning can lead to overfitting and forgetting.

Method: R2R combines dynamic expert routing with Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG) and a lightweight Latent Semantic Router for efficient domain specialization.

Result: R2R outperforms generalist and fine-tuned baselines across domains such as legal, medical, and financial, showcasing its model-agnostic, modular, and robust nature.

Conclusion: R2R effectively specializes in different domains with enhanced cross-domain robustness, addressing the limitations of generalist rerankers.

Abstract: Decoder-only rerankers are central to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines. Our results confirm that R2R is a model-agnostic and modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness.

### [56] [Directional Optimization Asymmetry in Transformers: A Synthetic Stress Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19997)
*Mihir Sahasrabudhe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates directional bias in Transformers using a benchmark of entropy-controlled tasks, revealing inherent difficulties in learning inverse tasks compared to forward tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify if directional failures (e.g., reverse tasks being harder) stem from linguistic statistics or from architectural limitations in Transformers.

Method: A synthetic benchmark was created using random string mappings with controlled entropy to stress test directional learning in causal Transformers.

Result: Findings show that Transformers exhibit a strong natural directional bias, where inverse tasks are significantly harder, despite removing linguistic and corpus-level asymmetries. LoRA methods faced clear capacity limits in handling high-entropy mappings.

Conclusion: Directional friction appears intrinsic to causal Transformer training, motivating further scrutiny on this challenge in sequence model behavior and design.

Abstract: Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a "reversal curse," and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental health issues and cyberbullying are growing concerns in digital spaces, requiring scalable tools for detection and moderation.

Method: The authors curated balanced datasets from Twitter and Reddit, employed multiple classification models, and emphasized ethical use and explainability through tools like a SHAPLLM framework and a prototype dashboard.

Result: The domain-adapted MentalBERT achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: This paper sets a benchmark for AI systems in digital safety, emphasizing human moderation, ethical considerations, and the need for clinically-validated datasets for future work.

Abstract: Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable and efficient framework for online concept learning in personalized Visual Language Models (VLMs) using hyperbolic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and lack of scalability in existing personalized VLM methods, which require separate concept embeddings and cannot adapt in real-time during testing.

Method: A framework called Online-PVLM is introduced, which uses hyperbolic representations to generate concept embeddings at test time without training. This approach enables scalable and efficient online adaptation.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the newly developed OP-Eval benchmark, which contains 1,292 concepts and over 30K high-quality instances for evaluation.

Conclusion: Online-PVLM establishes a train-free and scalable paradigm for personalized VLMs, tackling challenges in large-scale scenarios. The source code and benchmark dataset will be publicly released.

Abstract: Personalized Visual Language Models (VLMs) are gaining increasing attention for their formidable ability in user-specific concepts aligned interactions (e.g., identifying a user's bike). Existing methods typically require the learning of separate embeddings for each new concept, which fails to support real-time adaptation during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in large-scale scenarios, where efficient retrieval of concept embeddings is not achievable. To alleviate this gap, we propose Online-PVLM, a framework for online concept learning by leveraging hyperbolic representations. Our approach makes a train-free paradigm for concept embeddings generation at test time, making the use of personalized VLMs both scalable and efficient. In addition, we develop OP-Eval, a comprehensive and large-scale benchmark comprising 1,292 concepts and over 30K high-quality instances with diverse question types, designed to rigorously assess online concept learning in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed framework. Our source code and dataset will be made available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTA, a framework for personalized large language models that addresses scalability and data sparsity issues, achieving superior performance on the LaMP benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a scalable and effective method for personalizing large language models to align with individual user preferences, overcoming limitations like storage costs and poor performance for users with sparse data.

Method: The proposed MTA framework includes three stages: (1) creating a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by pre-training meta-personalization traits, (2) utilizing Adaptive LoRA Fusion for dynamic personalization without user-specific storage, and (3) applying LoRA Stacking for effective few-shot personalization using ultra-lightweight modules.

Result: MTA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple tasks in the LaMP benchmark.

Conclusion: The MTA framework successfully addresses the challenges of scalability and data sparsity in personalized large language models, providing a highly effective and flexible solution.

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) aim to align model outputs with individual user preferences, a crucial capability for user-centric applications. However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks.

Motivation: Improving the performance of LLMs on multiple-choice question tasks by addressing limitations such as lack of contextual grounding and insufficient reasoning for all possible answers.

Method: BiasPrompting is an inference framework with two stages: reasoning generation, where supportive reasoning is produced for each answer option, and reasoning-guided agreement, where these reasonings are synthesized to determine the most plausible answer.

Result: BiasPrompting achieves significant performance gains across five multiple-choice question benchmarks, showcasing improved reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: With BiasPrompting, LLMs demonstrate enhanced reasoning skills and are better suited to tackle complex questions, outperforming existing methods in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their performance on multiple-choice question (MCQ) tasks has improved significantly. However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks. Our experiments showcase that BiasPrompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and provides a strong foundation for tackling complex and challenging questions, particularly in settings where existing methods underperform.

### [61] [SSA: Sparse Sparse Attention by Aligning Full and Sparse Attention Outputs in Feature Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20102)
*Zhenyi Shen,Junru Lu,Lin Gui,Jiazheng Li,Yulan He,Di Yin,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiencies in sparse attention methods for large language models, proposing SSA—a framework that integrates sparse and full attention for improved performance and long-context extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse attention methods for large language models struggle with performance loss and lack robust gradient updates for excluded tokens, limiting their effectiveness in handling long contexts efficiently.

Method: SSA incorporates a unified framework combining both sparse and full attention, ensuring gradient flow and bidirectional alignment across all tokens to improve sparse attention outputs.

Result: SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance for both sparse and full attention while enabling flexible trade-offs between compute and performance at inference time. It also demonstrates strong extrapolation capabilities for long contexts.

Conclusion: SSA resolves sparse attention limitations through robust gradient management and aligns sparse outputs with full attention, ensuring efficient long-context handling and improved adaptability.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (LLMs). Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.

TL;DR: This paper investigates prompting-based approaches using large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4.1 and others to improve grammatical error correction (GEC) for low-resource Indic languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of limited resources, linguistic diversity, and complex morphology for GEC in Indic languages, which prevents them from achieving similar advances as high-resource languages.

Method: State-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5, and LLaMA-4 are adapted through prompting-based approaches, using zero-shot and few-shot strategies to improve GEC performance.

Result: The methods outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models, achieving leading rankings in shared GEC tasks for languages like Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Bangla, and Malayalam.

Conclusion: Prompting-based techniques and adaptable LLMs are highly effective for multilingual GEC in low-resource settings, bridging resource gaps and enhancing correction quality across languages.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction (GEC) is an important task in Natural Language Processing that aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical mistakes in text. While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages. We achieved leading results in the shared task--ranking 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97). These findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt-driven NLP techniques and underscore the potential of large-scale LLMs to bridge resource gaps in multilingual GEC.

TL;DR: This paper introduces augmented grid models with data augmentation techniques for Named Entity Recognition (NER), particularly addressing challenges in recognizing discontinuous entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve recognition accuracy for discontinuous entities, which are often missed or missegmented by traditional methods.

Method: The authors integrate image data augmentation techniques like cropping, scaling, and padding into grid-based NER models to better capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities.

Result: Augmented grid models show 1-2.5% overall F1 score improvements and 3.7-8.4% gains for discontinuous entities across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of data augmentation significantly enhances model performance for discontinuous entity recognition, resolving key segmentation challenges.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in natural language processing, yet it remains particularly challenging for discontinuous entities. The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces REFLEX, a novel fact-checking paradigm that leverages internal knowledge of language models, enabling accurate and interpretable verdicts without relying on external sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation on social media necessitates real-time, reliable, and interpretable fact-checking systems. Current LLM-based methods are hindered by dependency on external knowledge, leading to latency, unreliability, and hallucinations.

Method: The REFLEX paradigm embraces a role-play dialogue structure, steering vectors based on contrastive activation pairs, and self-refining mechanisms to guide inference and suppress noisy explanations. It jointly trains for both verdict prediction and explanation generation.

Result: REFLEX achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 465 training samples, shows up to 7.57% improvement in models without explanatory objectives, and highlights the dual role of explanation signals in factual reasoning and interpretability.

Conclusion: REFLEX effectively addresses challenges in automated fact-checking by leveraging internal knowledge, improving accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of generated explanations.

Abstract: The prevalence of misinformation on social media threatens public trust, demanding automated fact-checking systems that provide accurate verdicts with interpretable explanations. However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecFormer enhances LLM inference speed by integrating unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms, enabling efficient speculative decoding without relying on complex prefix trees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome inefficiencies in speculative decoding methods, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources and low verification capabilities.

Method: SpecFormer combines features of autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, utilizing a novel attention architecture for parallel generation on draft sequences.

Result: SpecFormer consistently accelerates speculative decoding across different model scales, reducing training demands and computational costs.

Conclusion: SpecFormer introduces a scalable and resource-efficient solution for speculative decoding, optimizing LLM inference performance even with large batch processing.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by utilizing otherwise idle computational resources during memory-to-chip data transfer. Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.

*Taewhoo Lee,Minju Song,Chanwoong Yoon,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform analogical reasoning and explores their emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying relational concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether LLMs can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to new situations is crucial for advancing AI toward more human-like cognitive abilities.

Method: The authors analyze proportional and story analogies to evaluate relational concept representation and application in LLMs. They identify patterns in encoding entities and relational information and propose strategic interventions to enhance reasoning capabilities when errors occur.

Result: LLMs demonstrate the ability to encode relationships and propagate relational information in many cases but struggle with applying relational concepts to novel entities. Strategic adjustments to hidden representations can partially improve information transfer.

Conclusion: LLMs show emerging capabilities for analogical reasoning but fall short compared to humans when encoding and applying relational concepts to new situations. Enhanced structural alignment is key to improving reasoning performance.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities. While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BengaliFig, a dataset containing riddles from Bengali culture to evaluate LLM performance in figurative and culturally specific reasoning for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address evaluation gaps of LLMs in reasoning tied to culture and figurative language for low-resource languages like Bengali.

Method: Prepared BengaliFig dataset with 435 riddles, annotated along five reasoning dimensions, converted to multiple-choice format, and evaluated LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot prompting.

Result: LLMs exhibited consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning while using BengaliFig dataset.

Conclusion: BengaliFig serves as a diagnostic tool for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and promotes inclusive NLP evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models excel on broad multilingual benchmarks but remain to be evaluated extensively in figurative and culturally grounded reasoning, especially in low-resource contexts. We present BengaliFig, a compact yet richly annotated challenge set that targets this gap in Bengali, a widely spoken low-resourced language. The dataset contains 435 unique riddles drawn from Bengali oral and literary traditions. Each item is annotated along five orthogonal dimensions capturing reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, and difficulty, and is automatically converted to multiple-choice format through a constraint-aware, AI-assisted pipeline. We evaluate eight frontier LLMs from major providers under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, revealing consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning. BengaliFig thus contributes both a diagnostic probe for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward inclusive and heritage-aware NLP evaluation.

*Md Abdullah Al Kafi,Raka Moni,Sumit Kumar Banshal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel task-oriented evaluation framework for stemming methods, addressing limitations of existing approaches. It applied this framework to Bangla and English stemmers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for stemming are inadequate, especially in capturing excessive stemming's potential harm. A new evaluation approach is required.

Method: The study proposes evaluating stemming through three aspects: SES (Stemming Effectiveness Score), MPD (Model Performance Delta), and ANLD (Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance).

Result: The framework revealed Bangla stemmer's excessive stemming despite high SES, leading to downstream performance drops. The English stemmer, however, balanced SES and ANLD well, yielding more reliable results.

Conclusion: The proposed framework highlights the need to balance efficiency (SES) with meaning preservation (ANLD) for effective stemming evaluation.

Abstract: Text normalization is an essential preprocessing step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and stemming is one such normalization technique that reduces words to their base or root form. However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).

TL;DR: This paper explores training generative models to mimic 19th-century authors' writing styles, using minimal prompts and assessing the outputs with transformer-based detectors and AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stylistic text generation faces challenges of creating models without paired data and evaluating text styles without solely human judgment, motivating novel solutions.

Method: Large language models are fine-tuned using single-token prompts, while a transformer-based detector and explainable AI techniques assess stylistic accuracy and identify distinctive linguistic cues.

Result: Generated texts successfully imitate the stylistic patterns of Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville, validated by AI-based evaluation.

Conclusion: AI-driven evaluation provides a dependable alternative to human judgment for stylistic imitation, advancing methods in stylometry.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have created new opportunities for stylometry, the study of writing styles and authorship. Two challenges, however, remain central: training generative models when no paired data exist, and evaluating stylistic text without relying only on human judgment. In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation. We complement this with syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods, including attention-based and gradient-based analyses, to identify the linguistic cues that drive stylistic imitation. Our findings show that the generated text reflects the authors' distinctive patterns and that AI-based evaluation offers a reliable alternative to human assessment. All artifacts of this work are published online.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel attack called the Adversarial Confusion Attack aimed at disrupting the output of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by generating incoherent or confidently incorrect responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose a new potential vulnerability in multimodal large language models by demonstrating a systematic weakness that attackers can exploit.

Method: The method uses a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs and applies adversarial techniques (such as PGD) to maximize next-token entropy, which results in a single adversarial image that can disrupt models across various scenarios.

Result: The attack successfully disrupts multiple MLLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, showcasing its transferability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial technique highlights a critical vulnerability in MLLMs, emphasizing the need for robust defense mechanisms against such attacks.

Abstract: We introduce the Adversarial Confusion Attack, a new class of threats against multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Applications include embedding adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.

TL;DR: Introduction of the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB) to assess aphasic-like language deficits in large language models through a text-only approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clinical assessments for aphasia are unsuitable for LLMs due to differences in pragmatic pressures and cognitive processes.

Method: The authors designed TAB, a text-based benchmark, with four subtests and validated the tool using automated evaluation with Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Result: The automated protocol demonstrated reliability comparable to human raters, offering scalable assessment for language deficits in artificial models.

Conclusion: TAB provides a clinically-informed framework to analyze aphasic-like deficits in large language models in a scalable manner.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a candidate "model organism" for human language, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study the computational basis of linguistic disorders like aphasia. However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement). We release TAB as a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems.

Motivation: Addressing the unfair performance gap in audio tasks for low-resource languages due to limited training data.

Method: Introducing a novel data augmentation technique tailored for speech corpora.

Result: Significant performance improvement of speech recognition systems for low-resource languages compared to existing augmentation strategies.

Conclusion: Practical solution improves speech technology for underrepresented linguistic communities.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models for audio tasks often exhibit superior performance on English and other well-resourced languages, primarily due to the abundance of available training data. This disparity leads to an unfair performance gap for low-resource languages, where data collection is both challenging and costly. In this work, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique for speech corpora designed to mitigate this gap. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of automatic speech recognition systems on low-resource languages. Furthermore, we show that our approach outperforms existing augmentation strategies, offering a practical solution for enhancing speech technology in underrepresented linguistic communities.

Method: Development of an annotated dataset and evaluation of state-of-the-art language models (GPT-3.5, Llama-3.1) for automatic prediction of discourse features in educational dialogues.

Result: The tested models performed suboptimally, indicating the need for further improvements in NLP approaches for such tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging NLP has great potential in identifying discourse features, but current models are inadequate, necessitating further research and development.

Abstract: Identifying discourse features in student conversations is quite important for educational researchers to recognize the curricular and pedagogical variables that cause students to engage in constructing knowledge rather than merely completing tasks. The manual analysis of student conversations to identify these discourse features is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which limits the scale and scope of studies. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights. However, existing studies in NLP that focus on discourse in dialogue rarely address educational data. In this work, we address this gap by introducing an annotated educational dialogue dataset of student conversations featuring knowledge construction and task production discourse. We also establish baseline models for automatically predicting these discourse properties for each turn of talk within conversations, using pre-trained large language models GPT-3.5 and Llama-3.1. Experimental results indicate that these state-of-the-art models perform suboptimally on this task, indicating the potential for future research.

### [77] [On Evaluating LLM Alignment by Evaluating LLMs as Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20604)
*Yixin Liu,Pengfei Liu,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AlignEval, a benchmark to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) alignment with human preferences by analyzing their evaluation capabilities instead of directly assessing the generated outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human preference alignment in LLMs is critical for ensuring models behave in a helpful, honest, and safe manner. The traditional evaluation requires intensive human or LLM judges for open-ended responses, prompting a need for better evaluation methods.

Method: The study analyzes the consistency between generation and evaluation abilities across LLMs using a strong preference oracle and introduces AlignEval, a benchmarking method that assesses alignment by evaluating LLMs as judges rather than analyzing their generated outputs.

Result: The proposed AlignEval benchmark demonstrated superior or comparable performance to existing benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval, Arena-Hard) in matching human preferences when ranking LLMs.

Conclusion: This work reveals the strong correlation between LLM evaluation and generation capabilities. It also provides a novel evaluation benchmark (AlignEval) that effectively assesses preference alignment without directly evaluating generated outputs, offering a more efficient framework.

Abstract: Alignment with human preferences is an important evaluation aspect of LLMs, requiring them to be helpful, honest, safe, and to precisely follow human instructions. Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.

TL;DR: LatentMAS improves multi-agent collaboration by enabling communication in latent space, outperforming traditional text-based approaches in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of text-based mediation in existing LLM-based multi-agent systems by enabling direct collaboration in latent space.

Method: The paper introduces LatentMAS, a training-free framework that uses latent embeddings for agent communication and transfers internal representations through a shared latent memory.

Result: LatentMAS outperforms baseline single-model and text-based multi-agent systems across 9 benchmarks, achieving up to a 14.6% accuracy increase, 70.8%-83.7% reduction in output token usage, and 4x-4.3x faster inference.

Conclusion: LatentMAS enhances multi-agent system-level reasoning and efficiency, providing a promising alternative to traditional frameworks without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training.

TL;DR: The paper presents PIGReward, a novel personalized reward model for evaluating text-to-image (T2I) generation aligning with individual user preferences and optimizing prompts, alongside introducing the PIGBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional evaluation methods lack the ability to assess diversity and complexity of individual user preferences in T2I models.

Method: PIGReward uses dynamic user-conditioned evaluation and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, employing a self-bootstrapping strategy to personalize evaluation with limited user data.

Result: Experiments show PIGReward's superiority in accuracy and interpretability compared to existing methods, enabling advanced personalized evaluations and prompt optimizations.

Conclusion: PIGReward provides a scalable and reasoning-based solution for personalized T2I evaluation and optimization, marking progress toward individually aligned T2I generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models generate semantically coherent images from textual prompts, yet evaluating how well they align with individual user preferences remains an open challenge. Conventional evaluation methods, general reward functions or similarity-based metrics, fail to capture the diversity and complexity of personal visual tastes. In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent. We further introduce PIGBench, a per-user preference benchmark capturing diverse visual interpretations of shared prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIGReward surpasses existing methods in both accuracy and interpretability, establishing a scalable and reasoning-based foundation for personalized T2I evaluation and optimization. Taken together, our findings highlight PIGReward as a robust steptoward individually aligned T2I generation.

### [81] [SG-OIF: A Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework for Reliable Vision Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19466)
*Penghao Rao,Runmin Jiang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), a novel approach for real-time influence estimation in deep-learning models to enhance noisy and out-of-distribution data detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for influence estimation in deep-learning vision models face challenges such as computational cost, training non-stationarity, and lack of reliable confidence calibration, resulting in fragile ranking and misidentification of critical examples.

Method: The SG-OIF framework uses a stability-guided real-time controller for influence estimation. It employs stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann for anchor IHVPs, modular curvature backends, stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence to improve influence score accuracy.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness, leading to State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance in noisy-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across datasets with corruption. Key results include 91.1% accuracy for top prediction samples on CIFAR-10 (20% asymmetric noise) and 99.8% AUPR score on MNIST.

Conclusion: SG-OIF represents a practical and efficient solution for online influence estimation, significantly improving model reliability for noisy and out-of-distribution data detection tasks.

Abstract: Approximating training-point influence on test predictions is critical for deploying deep-learning vision models, essential for locating noisy data. Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption. Notably, our approach achieves 91.1\% accuracy in the top 1\% prediction samples on the CIFAR-10 (20\% asym), and gets 99.8\% AUPR score on MNIST, effectively demonstrating that this framework is a practical controller for online influence estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pistachio is a newly developed benchmark for Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) and Understanding (VAU), created using controlled video generation to improve dataset diversity, balance, and temporal complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for VAD lack sufficient scene diversity, proper anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity. Furthermore, VAU requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning, yet benchmarking remains challenging due to demanding manual annotation processes.

Method: Pistachio is constructed using a controlled generation-based pipeline that leverages advanced video generation models. It involves scene-conditioned anomaly creation, multi-step storyline construction, and temporally coherent long-form video synthesis.

Result: Pistachio creates 41-second coherent videos through automated means, minimizing bias and manual efforts, and effectively challenges existing methods while fostering research on dynamic anomalies.

Conclusion: The Pistachio framework sets a foundation for improved benchmarking in VAD/VAU, addressing prior limitations and motivating research on complex anomaly scenarios.

Abstract: Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.

*Tianlu Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Guiguang Ding,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SATA, a framework for unifying tracking and segmentation subtasks across various modalities, addressing distributional and representation gaps and achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generalized framework for tracking and segmentation tasks that avoids specialized architectures and enables effective knowledge sharing across modalities and tasks.

Method: SATA employs a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism for cross-modal shared and specific knowledge representation, and introduces a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline for unified task output handling and ID calibration.

Result: SATA surpasses existing methods on 18 tracking and segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating its scalability and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: SATA opens a new perspective for scalable, generalizable video understanding by effectively addressing modality and task representation gaps.

Abstract: Tracking and segmentation play essential roles in video understanding, providing basic positional information and temporal association of objects within video sequences. Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training. SATA demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks, offering a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding.

*Daniel Harari,Michael Sidorov,Liel David,Chen Shterental,Abrham Kahsay Gebreselasie,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how well large multi-modal models (LMMs) comprehend dynamic visual input, particularly in identifying key moments in object interactions, using a newly developed dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine whether large multi-modal models truly ground their semantic understanding in visual data, focusing on dynamic interactions involving object contact and release.

Method: The authors created a novel, large-scale annotated dataset of 20K interactions based on the Something-Something-V2 dataset. Human annotators marked specific events like 'contact' and 'release,' and the performance of two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) was tested on these annotations.

Result: The models could identify objects, actions, and reasoning but struggled to pinpoint the start or end frames of interactions and failed to localize the events spatially within the scene.

Conclusion: LMMs lack perceptual grounding necessary for fully comprehending the dynamics of interactions in visual tasks, indicating limitations in scene understanding and perceptual reasoning.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) show increasing performance in realistic visual tasks for images and, more recently, for videos. For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes.

### [85] [The Determinant Ratio Matrix Approach to Solving 3D Matching and 2D Orthographic Projection Alignment Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19511)
*Andrew J. Hanson,Sonya M. Hanson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on solving pose estimation problems, specifically relating to orientation in 3D and 2D projections, using new methods within the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) family.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve solutions for pose estimation problems, which have widespread applications in computer vision.

Method: The authors introduce a DRaM approach to solve the least squares systems for exact and noisy EnP (3D-3D) and OnP (3D-2D orthographic projection) problems, conducting comparisons with previous methods.

Result: The study establishes DRaM-based solutions that could historically have been derived, providing valuable insight into pose estimation problems and demonstrating effectiveness for noisy data cases.

Conclusion: DRaM solutions generalize pose estimation methods to N-dimensional Euclidean problems, presenting insights and comparative advantages for existing and new pose estimation tasks.

Abstract: Pose estimation is a general problem in computer vision with wide applications. The relative orientation of a 3D reference object can be determined from a 3D rotated version of that object, or from a projection of the rotated object to a 2D planar image. This projection can be a perspective projection (the PnP problem) or an orthographic projection (the OnP problem). We restrict our attention here to the OnP problem and the full 3D pose estimation task (the EnP problem). Here we solve the least squares systems for both the error-free EnP and OnP problems in terms of the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach. The noisy-data case can be addressed with a straightforward rotation correction scheme. While the SVD and optimal quaternion eigensystem methods solve the noisy EnP 3D-3D alignment exactly, the noisy 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) task has no known comparable closed form, and can be solved by DRaM-class methods. We note that while previous similar work has been presented in the literature exploiting both the QR decomposition and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse transformations, here we place these methods in a larger context that has not previously been fully recognized in the absence of the corresponding DRaM solution. We term this class of solutions as the DRaM family, and conduct comparisons of the behavior of the families of solutions for the EnP and OnP rotation estimation problems. Overall, this work presents both a new solution to the 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation problems and provides valuable insight into these classes of problems. With hindsight, we are able to show that our DRaM solutions to the exact EnP and OnP problems possess derivations that could have been discovered in the time of Gauss, and in fact generalize to all analogous N-dimensional Euclidean pose estimation problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simultaneously achieving fast, detailed, and high-fidelity 3D object generation.

Method: The framework uses a pre-trained variational autoencoder to map 3D geometries to latent features, followed by a pipeline that sequentially generates coarse geometries, refined geometries, and realistic textures.

Result: LatentDreamer achieves high fidelity to input images and completes 3D generation within 70 seconds. It performs competitively with minimal training compared to contemporary methods.

Conclusion: LatentDreamer enables rapid and high-quality 3D object creation, showcasing promise for efficient and effective digital asset generation.

Abstract: 3D assets are essential in the digital age. While automatic 3D generation, such as image-to-3d, has made significant strides in recent years, it often struggles to achieve fast, detailed, and high-fidelity generation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce LatentDreamer, a novel framework for generating 3D objects from single images. The key to our approach is a pre-trained variational autoencoder that maps 3D geometries to latent features, which greatly reducing the difficulty of 3D generation. Starting from latent features, the pipeline of LatentDreamer generates coarse geometries, refined geometries, and realistic textures sequentially. The 3D objects generated by LatentDreamer exhibit high fidelity to the input images, and the entire generation process can be completed within a short time (typically in 70 seconds). Extensive experiments show that with only a small amount of training, LatentDreamer demonstrates competitive performance compared to contemporary approachs.

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between model size and minimal token usage for image semantics, introducing Orthogonal Filtering to optimize token representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how model capacity impacts the minimal number of tokens required to represent image semantics effectively.

Method: The authors propose Orthogonal Filtering, which clusters redundant tokens into a compact set of orthogonal bases, and conduct experiments on ViT models.

Result: The study finds a token-model scaling law: larger models require fewer tokens, and they provide a long-context visual dataset.

Conclusion: Optimizing visual token representation can align with model scaling, offering insights for efficient semantic encoding systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental relationship between model capacity and the minimal number of visual tokens required to preserve image semantics. Inspired by the Minimum Description Length principle, we reinterpret image tokens as vectors in a visual semantic space and define the intrinsic semantic complexity of an image as the smallest set of basis vectors needed to span this space. Building on this perspective, we propose Orthogonal Filtering, a lightweight module that adaptively clusters redundant tokens into a compact set of orthogonal bases. Through extensive experiments across a range of ViT models, we reveal a consistent token, model scaling law: larger models require significantly fewer tokens to span visual semantic space. Besides, we also contribute a visual long-context dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GroundingAgent, a framework for visual grounding without task-specific fine-tuning, achieving strong zero-shot accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual grounding methods rely on extensive annotations and fine-tuning, limiting their generalization to new or out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: GroundingAgent uses iterative reasoning with pretrained object detectors, multimodal large language models, and language models to refine candidate regions via semantic and spatial evaluations.

Result: GroundingAgent achieves 65.1% zero-shot accuracy on RefCOCO benchmarks and nearly 90% accuracy in a selection stage, comparable to supervised models.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective zero-shot performance, high interpretability, and highlights the importance of reasoning in large language models for visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: Visual grounding, the task of linking textual queries to specific regions within images, plays a pivotal role in vision-language integration. Existing methods typically rely on extensive task-specific annotations and fine-tuning, limiting their ability to generalize effectively to novel or out-of-distribution scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce GroundingAgent, a novel agentic visual grounding framework that operates without any task-specific fine-tuning. GroundingAgent employs a structured, iterative reasoning mechanism that integrates pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and large language models (LLMs) to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses. Remarkably, GroundingAgent achieves an average zero-shot grounding accuracy of 65.1 % on widely-used benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), entirely without fine-tuning. Furthermore, by substituting MLLM-generated captions with the original query texts, the accuracy at the selection stage alone reaches approximately 90 %, closely matching supervised performance and underscoring the critical role of LLM reasoning capabilities. GroundingAgent also offers strong interpretability, transparently illustrating each reasoning step and providing clear insights into its decision-making process.

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for compressing vision-language models (VLMs), achieving significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges posed by the increasing scale of vision-language models, particularly with regard to deployment and computational efficiency, while ensuring information is preserved.

Method: The InfoPrune framework uses the Information Bottleneck principle to balance retaining task-relevant information and removing redundancies. It introduces an entropy-based effective rank and employs Kolmogorov--Smirnov distance to measure structural divergence, guiding compression through head pruning and low-rank approximation.

Result: InfoPrune demonstrates substantial gains, achieving up to 3.2x reduction in FLOPs and 1.8x acceleration on tasks such as VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA, with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: The InfoPrune framework provides a theoretically grounded and practical method for efficient compression of large-scale multimodal models, enabling better deployment without significant performance tradeoffs.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their ever-growing scale poses severe challenges for deployment and efficiency. Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation. Extensive experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate that InfoPrune achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation, establishing a theoretically grounded and practically effective step toward efficient multimodal large models.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving road safety by detecting driver drowsiness more reliably and addressing limitations of conventional methods such as binary eye state estimators and 2D measures like EAR.

Method: The authors propose ELA as a 3D geometric measure of eye openness and design a blink detection framework leveraging ELA signals. They also generate synthetic datasets using Blender 3D to simulate realistic drowsiness scenarios.

Result: ELA demonstrates robustness to camera angle variations, achieves accurate blink detection, and enriches drowsiness recognition datasets through synthetic augmentation.

Conclusion: ELA is a stable, reproducible biometric measure and an effective tool for scalable dataset generation in driver state monitoring, improving reliability and diversity in drowsiness detection.

Abstract: Detecting driver drowsiness reliably is crucial for enhancing road safety and supporting advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection. At the same time, synthetic augmentation expands the diversity of training data for drowsiness recognition. Our findings highlight the ELA as both a reliable biometric measure and a powerful tool for generating scalable datasets in driver state monitoring.

Motivation: Current multi-agent video understanding models rely on static tool invocation mechanisms that restrict the exploration of diverse clues necessary for analyzing complex videos. Therefore, the need arises for dynamic and collaborative systems for more robust perception and reasoning.

Method: The proposed VideoChat-M1 employs a Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with three processes: Policy Generation, Policy Execution, and Policy Communication. This is complemented with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for joint agent optimization.

Result: VideoChat-M1 achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across eight benchmarks and outperformed existing models like Gemini 2.5 pro and GPT-4o significantly on tasks involving complex videos.

Conclusion: VideoChat-M1 demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic collaborative policies and reinforcement learning in advancing the performance of multi-agent video understanding systems for complex queries.

Abstract: By leveraging tool-augmented Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), multi-agent frameworks are driving progress in video understanding. However, most of them adopt static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, which limit the discovery of diverse clues essential for robust perception and reasoning regarding temporally or spatially complex videos. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-agent system for video understanding, namely VideoChat-M1. Instead of using a single or fixed policy, VideoChat-M1 adopts a distinct Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with multiple policy agents, which comprises three key processes. (1) Policy Generation: Each agent generates its unique tool invocation policy tailored to the user's query; (2) Policy Execution: Each agent sequentially invokes relevant tools to execute its policy and explore the video content; (3) Policy Communication: During the intermediate stages of policy execution, agents interact with one another to update their respective policies. Through this collaborative framework, all agents work in tandem, dynamically refining their preferred policies based on contextual insights from peers to effectively respond to the user's query. Moreover, we equip our CPP paradigm with a concise Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method. Consequently, the team of policy agents can be jointly optimized to enhance VideoChat-M1's performance, guided by both the final answer reward and intermediate collaborative process feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoChat-M1 achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks. Notably, on LongVideoBench, our method outperforms the SOTA model Gemini 2.5 pro by 3.6% and GPT-4o by 15.6%.

### [92] [Perceptual Taxonomy: Evaluating and Guiding Hierarchical Scene Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19526)
*Jonathan Lee,Xingrui Wang,Jiawei Peng,Luoxin Ye,Zehan Zheng,Tiezheng Zhang,Tao Wang,Wufei Ma,Siyi Chen,Yu-Cheng Chou,Prakhar Kaushik,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured scene understanding process called Perceptual Taxonomy and proposes a benchmark to evaluate task-relevant visual reasoning, noting gaps in current models' performance on attribute-driven reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models excel in surface-level recognition but lack comprehensive evaluation of task-relevant scene reasoning, which limits their cognitive and goal-directed applications.

Method: Researchers annotate 3173 objects with 84 fine-grained attributes and construct a benchmark with 28033 template-based questions across four reasoning types (object description, spatial reasoning, etc.) to evaluate scene understanding.

Result: Leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but show a 10-20% decline for complex multi-step reasoning questions, illustrating deficiencies in their visual reasoning capacity.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation like Perceptual Taxonomy is crucial for advancing physically grounded visual reasoning, and in-context reasoning examples can enhance model performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We propose Perceptual Taxonomy, a structured process of scene understanding that first recognizes objects and their spatial configurations, then infers task-relevant properties such as material, affordance, function, and physical attributes to support goal-directed reasoning. While this form of reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, current vision-language benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of this ability and instead focus on surface-level recognition or image-text alignment.
  To address this gap, we introduce Perceptual Taxonomy, a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning. We annotate 3173 objects with four property families covering 84 fine-grained attributes. Using these annotations, we construct a multiple-choice question benchmark with 5802 images across both synthetic and real domains. The benchmark contains 28033 template-based questions spanning four types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, and taxonomy reasoning), along with 50 expert-crafted questions designed to evaluate models across the full spectrum of perceptual taxonomy reasoning.
  Experimental results show that leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10 to 20 percent on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning over structured attributes. These findings highlight a persistent gap in structured visual understanding and the limitations of current models that rely heavily on pattern matching. We also show that providing in-context reasoning examples from simulated scenes improves performance on real-world and expert-curated questions, demonstrating the effectiveness of perceptual-taxonomy-guided prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MapRF, a weakly supervised method for constructing 3D HD maps for autonomous driving using only 2D image labels, overcoming reliance on costly 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of existing HD map construction methods for autonomous driving, which rely on costly 3D map annotations, reducing scalability and generalization across diverse driving environments.

Method: MapRF employs a weakly supervised framework based on 2D image labels and introduces Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) conditioned on map predictions to generate pseudo labels. Self-training and a Map-to-Ray Matching strategy refine map predictions iteratively without additional supervision.

Result: Experiments on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets show MapRF achieves around 75% of fully supervised methods' performance and surpasses several other methods using 2D labels.

Conclusion: MapRF demonstrates a scalable and cost-effective solution for constructing online HD maps, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems benefit from high-definition (HD) maps that provide critical information about road infrastructure. The online construction of HD maps offers a scalable approach to generate local maps from on-board sensors. However, existing methods typically rely on costly 3D map annotations for training, which limits their generalization and scalability across diverse driving environments. In this work, we propose MapRF, a weakly supervised framework that learns to construct 3D maps using only 2D image labels. To generate high-quality pseudo labels, we introduce a novel Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) module conditioned on map predictions, which reconstructs view-consistent 3D geometry and semantics. These pseudo labels are then iteratively used to refine the map network in a self-training manner, enabling progressive improvement without additional supervision. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation during self-training, we propose a Map-to-Ray Matching strategy that aligns map predictions with camera rays derived from 2D labels. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that MapRF achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods, attaining around 75% of the baseline while surpassing several approaches using only 2D labels. This highlights the potential of MapRF to enable scalable and cost-effective online HD map construction for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: Vidi2 advances video understanding for multimodal temporal retrieval and spatial-temporal grounding, introducing new benchmarks and outperforming competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing demand for advanced video production and comprehensive multimodal reasoning solutions.

Method: Vidi2 integrates fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and video question answering (Video QA), paired with new benchmarks for evaluation.

Result: Vidi2 significantly outperforms proprietary systems like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5, achieving competitive Video QA results against open-source models.

Conclusion: Vidi2 demonstrates enhanced video processing capabilities, setting a new standard for multimodal systems and facilitating complex video editing applications.

Abstract: Video has emerged as the primary medium for communication and creativity on the Internet, driving strong demand for scalable, high-quality video production. Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced video-length distribution and more user-style queries. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal large language model for detecting, localizing, and quantifying photovoltaic systems globally, addressing challenges like undocumented installations and domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Undocumented PV installations create challenges in power grid management. Traditional CV models require substantial labeled data and struggle with regional generalization.

Method: The model uses structured prompts and fine-tuning to integrate detection, localization, and quantification across multiple regions.

Result: The model achieves minimal performance degradation on unseen regions, as shown through cross-regional analysis, outperforming CV and transformer baselines.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs are robust under domain shifts and have significant potential for scalable, transferable, and interpretable global PV mapping.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems poses challenges for power grid management, as many installations remain undocumented. While satellite imagery provides global coverage, traditional computer vision (CV) models such as CNNs and U-Nets require extensive labeled data and fail to generalize across regions. This study investigates the cross-domain generalization of a multimodal large language model (LLM) for global PV assessment. By leveraging structured prompts and fine-tuning, the model integrates detection, localization, and quantification within a unified schema. Cross-regional evaluation using the $Δ$F1 metric demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the smallest performance degradation across unseen regions, outperforming conventional CV and transformer baselines. These results highlight the robustness of multimodal LLMs under domain shift and their potential for scalable, transferable, and interpretable global PV mapping.

*Remi Petitpierre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents methods and data to analyze the cultural heritage of cartography using a large-scale dataset of maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cartographic heritage from a cultural perspective and address the lack of engagement with the historical context and symbolic meaning of maps in automated methods.

Method: The study aggregated and normalized 771,561 map records and 99,715 images across six centuries, developed semantic segmentation for land classes, and trained object detection models for cartographic signs.

Result: Key findings include insights into the links between cartography and colonialism, evolving map figures (e.g., relief hachures to terrain contours), and patterns of collaboration in cartographic practices.

Conclusion: The research highlights maps as designed cultural artifacts, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing cartographic heritage and its global, historical, and symbolic dimensions.

Abstract: This thesis presents methods and datasets to investigate cartographic heritage on a large scale and from a cultural perspective. Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems. Analyses of collaboration and diffusion highlight the role of legitimacy, larger actors, and major cities in the spread of figurative norms and semiotic cultures.

*Jaeyeong Kim,Seungwoo Yoo,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpLap introduces a novel Laplacian-based method for deforming Gaussian splats using a surface-aware splat graph, avoiding dependency on proxies like meshes or cages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a robust deformation technique for Gaussian splats that avoids reliance on proxies (meshes or cages), which can introduce limitations, and also captures surface details more effectively.

Method: A surface-aware splat graph derived from spatial intersections is proposed for computing a Laplacian operator, combined with a Gaussian kernel adaptation technique to ensure surface preservation during deformation.

Result: The method outperforms existing proxy-based and proxy-free techniques in preserving surface details and topology, as evaluated on diverse datasets including ShapeNet, Objaverse, Sketchfab, and NeRF-Synthetic.

Conclusion: SpLap provides a more effective and computationally efficient approach for Gaussian splat deformation, suitable for applications requiring high-quality rendering and topology preservation.

Abstract: We introduce SpLap, a proxy-free deformation method for Gaussian splats (GS) based on a Laplacian operator computed from our novel surface-aware splat graph. Existing approaches to GS deformation typically rely on deformation proxies such as cages or meshes, but they suffer from dependency on proxy quality and additional computational overhead. An alternative is to directly apply Laplacian-based deformation techniques by treating splats as point clouds. However, this often fail to properly capture surface information due to lack of explicit structure. To address this, we propose a novel method that constructs a surface-aware splat graph, enabling the Laplacian operator derived from it to support more plausible deformations that preserve details and topology. Our key idea is to leverage the spatial arrangement encoded in splats, defining neighboring splats not merely by the distance between their centers, but by their intersections. Furthermore, we introduce a Gaussian kernel adaptation technique that preserves surface structure under deformation, thereby improving rendering quality after deformation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to both proxy-based and proxy-free baselines, evaluated on 50 challenging objects from the ShapeNet, Objaverse, and Sketchfab datasets, as well as the NeRF-Synthetic dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ThiFAN-VQA, a transformative visual question answering framework leveraging two-stage reasoning to improve disaster response evaluations using AI, demonstrating strong performance with UAV imagery datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in disaster response, particularly the need for accurate, scalable AI systems to process UAV imagery while mitigating limitations in data collection and model adaptability.

Method: ThiFAN-VQA utilizes chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and in-context learning (ICL) for generating reasoning traces and an answer selection module for accuracy by combining reasoning-guided steps with a domain-specific prompting system.

Result: ThiFAN-VQA markedly outperforms existing VQA models on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA datasets, with enhanced accuracy, reasoning capability, and practical application in assessing disaster damages.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully balances interpretability, adaptability, and accuracy, establishing its utility for post-disaster assessments while leveraging zero-shot capabilities without sacrificing consistency.

Abstract: Timely and accurate assessment of damages following natural disasters is essential for effective emergency response and recovery. Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision. A subsequent answer selection module evaluates the generated responses and assigns the most coherent and contextually accurate answer, effectively improve the model performance. By integrating a custom information retrieval system, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided answer selection, ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency. Experiments on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA, UAV-based datasets from flood- and hurricane-affected regions, demonstrate that ThiFAN-VQA achieves superior accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability for real-world post-disaster damage assessment tasks.

Motivation: To develop a lightweight OCR-specific model that balances versatility, efficiency, and state-of-the-art performance, addressing the limitations of narrow expert models and inefficient general VLMs.

Method: The model combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM, connected via an MLP adapter. It eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules by adopting a fully end-to-end paradigm and incorporates high-quality data and reinforcement learning to improve performance.

Result: HunyuanOCR outperforms larger models and commercial APIs in multiple OCR-related tasks, achieves first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track), and sets new benchmarks for VLMs under 3B parameters.

Conclusion: HunyuanOCR advances the state-of-the-art in OCR by unifying diverse capabilities in a lightweight, efficient framework and streamlining deployment for practical and industrial applications.

Abstract: This paper presents HunyuanOCR, a commercial-grade, open-source, and lightweight (1B parameters) Vision-Language Model (VLM) dedicated to OCR tasks. The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.
  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow "OCR expert models" and inefficient "General VLMs". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.
  HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier. We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications.

*Maria Thoma,Michalis A. Savelonas,Dimitris K. Iakovidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a GAN-based semi-supervised approach for segmenting ischemic stroke regions on NCCT scans, improving early detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the diagnostic limitations of standard non-contrast computed tomography in identifying early ischemic changes in stroke patients.

Method: The study introduces a semi-supervised generative adversarial network (GAN) that learns from both annotated and unannotated NCCT scans and uses combined loss functions for improved segmentation.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior ability in segmenting early infarcts using the Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD), showing potential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency.

Conclusion: This GAN-based approach could advance stroke diagnostics by improving early ischemic stroke detection and reducing dependency on manual annotations.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke is a time-critical medical emergency where rapid diagnosis is essential for improving patient outcomes. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase. This limitation can delay crucial interventions. To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small. Experiments on the publicly available Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce the burden of manual annotation, and support more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSVQ-VAE, a novel VAE-based model for generating synthetic Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images, including abnormal findings, to aid Clinical Decision Support systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual screening of large volumes of gastrointestinal images via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy is laborious, and there is a need for efficient deep learning models which struggle due to the scarcity of diverse medical datasets.

Method: A novel Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE) is proposed, capable of introducing abnormalities into normal WCE images and supporting conditional synthesis of diverse abnormality types.

Result: Experiments confirm that using synthetic WCE images generated by MSVQ-VAE for classifier training yields performance comparable to classifiers trained with real datasets.

Conclusion: The MSVQ-VAE methodology is effective for generating diverse medical image data, showing promise in aiding Clinical Decision Support systems and applicability across multiple medical domains.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data. The generality of the proposed methodology promises its applicability to various domains related to medical multimedia.

TL;DR: The study introduces SkillSight, a power-efficient skill assessment system using gaze data from smart glasses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart glasses hold potential for skill learning, but current methods lack efficient automatic skill assessment, especially with first-person data.

Method: The proposed two-stage framework first models gaze and egocentric video together for skill prediction, then distills a gaze-only model for efficient inference.

Result: SkillSight achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets involving cooking, music, and sports, with the gaze-only model maintaining high accuracy using 73 times less power.

Conclusion: Gaze data can effectively predict skill levels, making SkillSight suitable for real-world AI-supported learning scenarios.

Abstract: Egocentric perception on smart glasses could transform how we learn new skills in the physical world, but automatic skill assessment remains a fundamental technical challenge. We introduce SkillSight for power-efficient skill assessment from first-person data. Central to our approach is the hypothesis that skill level is evident not only in how a person performs an activity (video), but also in how they direct their attention when doing so (gaze). Our two-stage framework first learns to jointly model gaze and egocentric video when predicting skill level, then distills a gaze-only student model. At inference, the student model requires only gaze input, drastically reducing power consumption by eliminating continuous video processing. Experiments on three datasets spanning cooking, music, and sports establish, for the first time, the valuable role of gaze in skill understanding across diverse real-world settings. Our SkillSight teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance, while our gaze-only student variant maintains high accuracy using 73x less power than competing methods. These results pave the way for in-the-wild AI-supported skill learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semantic-guided reconstruction framework for MRI reconstruction utilizing a vision-language foundation model to enhance contextual understanding, achieving superior results in perceptual quality and anatomical preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether high-level contextual information from vision-language models can enhance undersampled MRI reconstruction beyond conventional priors.

Method: A contrastive objective framework aligns reconstructed MRI features with semantic distributions derived from pre-trained vision-language models, tested with both image-only and image-language priors.

Result: Experiments on knee and brain MRI datasets show improved perceptual quality, anatomical structure preservation, and expanded semantic control over reconstructions using the proposed method.

Conclusion: Vision-language foundation models, leveraged through semantic-space alignment, enhance MRI reconstruction, demonstrating promising potential for advanced medical imaging techniques.

Abstract: Purpose: To investigate whether a vision-language foundation model can enhance undersampled MRI reconstruction by providing high-level contextual information beyond conventional priors. Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework. Conclusion: The study highlights that vision-language foundation models can improve undersampled MRI reconstruction through semantic-space optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GIANT, a framework for enabling large multimodal models (LMMs) to effectively navigate gigapixel pathology images, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of general-purpose LMMs in medical image interpretation, especially for pathology with its complex gigapixel images, where existing approaches fall short.

Method: The authors developed GIANT, which allows LMMs to navigate whole-slide images iteratively. They also introduced MultiPathQA, a benchmark containing clinically relevant questions and tasks in pathology.

Result: GIANT substantially outperformed traditional patch- and thumbnail-based baseline methods. For example, GPT-5 paired with GIANT achieved higher accuracy (62.5%) on expert-authored pathology questions compared to specialized pathology models like TITAN and SlideChat.

Conclusion: The study demonstrated the feasibility of adapting LMMs for expert-level reasoning in pathology, highlighting their strengths and limitations and providing a foundation for future models.

Abstract: Despite being widely used to support clinical care, general-purpose large multimodal models (LMMs) have generally shown poor or inconclusive performance in medical image interpretation, particularly in pathology, where gigapixel images are used. However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%). Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current foundation models and ground future development of LMMs for expert reasoning in pathology.

### [105] [CodeV: Code with Images for Faithful Visual Reasoning via Tool-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19661)
*Xinhai Hou,Shaoyuan Xu,Manan Biyani,Mayan Li,Jia Liu,Todd C. Hollon,Bryan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Agentic vision-language models often achieve high accuracy but lack faithful visual reasoning, leading to incorrect tool-use. CodeV introduces Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO) to ensure more effective and evidence-consistent tool-use, improving faithfulness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in faithful visual reasoning in agentic vision-language models by improving their ability to use visual tools consistently with evidence.

Method: The authors propose a faithfulness evaluation protocol and introduce CodeV, a code-based visual agent, which uses Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO) in a two-stage SFT+RL pipeline to supervise intermediate tool behavior effectively.

Result: CodeV demonstrates competitive or superior accuracy while substantially increasing faithful tool-use rates in visual search benchmarks, and performs strongly on multimodal reasoning and math benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicit supervision of intermediate tool behavior is crucial for building trustworthy visual reasoning systems, and CodeV provides a significant step towards this goal.

Abstract: Agentic vision-language models are increasingly trained to "think with images" by calling image operations. However, we show that high final-answer accuracy often hides unfaithful visual reasoning: models may invoke tools on irrelevant regions or ignore tool outputs entirely, yet still guess the correct answer. In this work, we first propose a faithfulness evaluation protocol that measures whether intermediate visual tool outputs (e.g., crops) actually contain the queried evidence. This reveals that recent visual agents achieve high final-answer accuracy but exhibit low rates of faithful tool-use on visual search benchmarks. We then introduce CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO). TAPO is a process-level RL framework that augments GRPO with dense rewards defined directly on visual tool inputs and outputs, rather than on chain-of-thought tokens, making supervision easier to verify and less susceptible to reward hacking. CodeV represents visual tools as executable Python code, and TAPO assigns step-wise rewards based solely on the question and tool output, encouraging both necessary and evidence-consistent tool use. In a two-stage SFT+RL pipeline, CodeV achieves competitive or superior accuracy while substantially increasing faithful tool-use rates on related visual search benchmarks. Beyond visual search, CodeV attains strong performance on a range of multimodal reasoning and math benchmarks, suggesting that explicitly supervising intermediate tool behavior is crucial for building trustworthy, agentic visual reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in early and accurate breast cancer detection by combining imaging modalities and clinical data for enhanced multimodal diagnostic precision.

Method: The method utilizes an attention-based encoder-decoder model to jointly segment multiple ROIs and predict clinical features. It employs late fusion strategies to combine multimodal data, operationalized through a secure web application providing structured reports and decision support.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, effective fusion of imaging and clinical insights, and improved diagnostic precision and inter-observer consistency.

Conclusion: OncoVision represents a scalable and equitable AI-powered solution for breast cancer screening, aiding early detection and improving treatment outcomes even in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: OncoVision is a multimodal AI pipeline that combines mammography images and clinical data for better breast cancer diagnosis. Employing an attention-based encoder-decoder backbone, it jointly segments four ROIs - masses, calcifications, axillary findings, and breast tissues - with state-of-the-art accuracy and robustly predicts ten structured clinical features: mass morphology, calcification type, ACR breast density, and BI-RADS categories. To fuse imaging and clinical insights, we developed two late-fusion strategies. By utilizing complementary multimodal data, late fusion strategies improve diagnostic precision and reduce inter-observer variability. Operationalized as a secure, user-friendly web application, OncoVision produces structured reports with dual-confidence scoring and attention-weighted visualizations for real-time diagnostic support to improve clinician trust and facilitate medical teaching. It can be easily incorporated into the clinic, making screening available in underprivileged areas around the world, such as rural South Asia. Combining accurate segmentation with clinical intuition, OncoVision raises the bar for AI-based mammography, offering a scalable and equitable solution to detect breast cancer at an earlier stage and enhancing treatment through timely interventions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INTERLACE is a new framework that removes redundant layers in VLMs while preserving performance by applying a unique interleaved finetune-freeze strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant performance drops caused by layer pruning in Vision Language Models (VLMs) and enable more efficient model designs.

Method: The framework identifies redundant layers by analyzing adjacent layer triplets, removes the most redundant layer, finetunes the remaining one, and freezes another layer for stability during finetuning.

Result: INTERLACE retains 88.9% average performance while reducing the network by 25%, using only 1% of FineVision dataset data for finetuning over one epoch.

Conclusion: INTERLACE effectively prunes VLMs with minimal performance loss, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency with a novel pruning and finetuning approach.

Abstract: We introduce INTERLACE, a novel framework that prunes redundant layers in VLMs while maintaining performance through sample-efficient finetuning. Existing layer pruning methods lead to significant performance drop when applied to VLMs. Instead, we analyze triplets of consecutive layers to identify local redundancy, removing the most redundant of the first two layers, finetune the remaining layer to compensate for the lost capacity, and freeze the third layer to serve as a stable anchor during finetuning. We found that this interleaved finetune-freeze design enables rapid convergence with minimal data after pruning. By finetuning only a subset of layers on just 1% of the FineVision dataset for one epoch, Interlace achieves 88.9% average performance retention after dropping 25% of the network, achieving SOTA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability of deep learning models in cell counting for clinical applications, addressing a critical challenge in their adoption.

Method: The method integrates a prototype layer within the density estimation network to learn visual patterns of cells and backgrounds, enabling region-based interpretability.

Result: Biologists validated the learned prototypes as relevant, and experiments on two datasets showed the method balances interpretability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This approach enhances transparency in cell counting deep models, fostering trust and adoption in biomedical research and clinical settings.

Abstract: Cell counting in biomedical imaging is pivotal for various clinical applications, yet the interpretability of deep learning models in this domain remains a significant challenge. We propose a novel prototype-based method for interpretable cell counting via density map estimation. Our approach integrates a prototype layer into the density estimation network, enabling the model to learn representative visual patterns for both cells and background artifacts. The learned prototypes were evaluated through a survey of biologists, who confirmed the relevance of the visual patterns identified, further validating the interpretability of the model. By generating interpretations that highlight regions in the input image most similar to each prototype, our method offers a clear understanding of how the model identifies and counts cells. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves interpretability without compromising counting effectiveness. This work provides researchers and clinicians with a transparent and reliable tool for cell counting, potentially increasing trust and accelerating the adoption of deep learning in critical biomedical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents RADSeg, an approach leveraging RADIO for improved open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, achieving better accuracy, reduced computational cost, and greater efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods, such as poor generalization, high computational demands, and reliance on extensive data or multiple large models.

Method: They enhance the RADIO model using techniques like recursive attention, global aggregation, and efficient mask refinement to improve segmentation performance across accuracy, efficiency, and speed.

Result: RADSeg outperforms previous methods, achieving 6-30% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), 3.95x faster processing, and 2.5x fewer parameters while surpassing the accuracy of larger models.

Conclusion: RADSeg provides a state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, balancing high performance with lower computational and memory requirements.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) underpins many vision and robotics tasks that require generalizable semantic understanding. Existing approaches either rely on limited segmentation training data, which hinders generalization, or apply zero-shot heuristics to vision-language models (e.g CLIP), while the most competitive approaches combine multiple models to improve performance at the cost of high computational and memory demands. In this work, we leverage an overlooked agglomerative vision foundation model, RADIO, to improve zero-shot OVSS along three key axes simultaneously: mIoU, latency, and parameter efficiency. We present the first comprehensive study of RADIO for zero-shot OVSS and enhance its performance through self-correlating recursive attention, self-correlating global aggregation, and computationally efficient mask refinement. Our approach, RADSeg, achieves 6-30% mIoU improvement in the base ViT class while being 3.95x faster and using 2.5x fewer parameters. Surprisingly, RADSeg-base (105M) outperforms previous combinations of huge vision models (850-1350M) in mIoU, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower computational and memory cost.

*Chengwei Zhou,Vipin Chaudhary,Gourav Datta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to reduce the layers of Vision Transformers during training while maintaining accuracy and achieving up to 37% faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers are computationally intensive, and most optimizations focus on specific elements rather than reducing the number of layers. This paper investigates if fewer transformer layers can retain comparable performance.

Method: A branch-based structural reparameterization technique is proposed, which condenses parallel transformer branches into single-path models during training without accuracy trade-offs at test time.

Result: The method reduces ViT-Tiny from 12 layers to 6, 4, or 3 while preserving ImageNet-1K classification accuracy and achieving up to a 37% speedup on mobile CPUs.

Conclusion: The paper challenges the preference for deep transformer stacks, proposing efficient designs that streamline architecture without compromising performance.

Abstract: The computational overhead of Vision Transformers in practice stems fundamentally from their deep architectures, yet existing acceleration strategies have primarily targeted algorithmic-level optimizations such as token pruning and attention speedup. This leaves an underexplored research question: can we reduce the number of stacked transformer layers while maintaining comparable representational capacity? To answer this, we propose a branch-based structural reparameterization technique that operates during the training phase. Our approach leverages parallel branches within transformer blocks that can be systematically consolidated into streamlined single-path models suitable for inference deployment. The consolidation mechanism works by gradually merging branches at the entry points of nonlinear components, enabling both feed-forward networks (FFN) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules to undergo exact mathematical reparameterization without inducing approximation errors at test time. When applied to ViT-Tiny, the framework successfully reduces the original 12-layer architecture to 6, 4, or as few as 3 layers while maintaining classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The resulting compressed models achieve inference speedups of up to 37% on mobile CPU platforms. Our findings suggest that the conventional wisdom favoring extremely deep transformer stacks may be unnecessarily restrictive, and point toward new opportunities for constructing efficient vision transformers.

TL;DR: This paper presents an altitude-aware dynamic tiling method for improving small object detection in UAV-based Search and Rescue missions, yielding better accuracy and speed compared to static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small objects in Search and Rescue operations are challenging to detect from high UAV altitudes as they result in low object-to-background pixel ratios, necessitating a better detection method.

Method: The authors introduce an altitude-aware dynamic tiling method that adaptively scales and subdivides images based on altitude to enhance detection of small objects while reducing computational load.

Result: The proposed method improved Mean Average Precision (mAP) for small objects by 38% and surpassed inference speed of static tiling by more than twofold when tested on the SeaDronesSee dataset with YOLOv5 and the SAHI framework.

Conclusion: The altitude-aware dynamic tiling approach significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of UAV-based Search and Rescue operations, especially for detecting small objects in diverse conditions.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are crucial in Search and Rescue (SAR) missions due to their ability to monitor vast maritime areas. However, small objects often remain difficult to detect from high altitudes due to low object-to-background pixel ratios. We propose an altitude-aware dynamic tiling method that scales and adaptively subdivides the image into tiles for enhanced small object detection. By integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor, we reduce unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance. Tested on the SeaDronesSee dataset [1] with YOLOv5 [2] and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework [3], our approach improves Mean Average Precision (mAP) for small objects by 38% compared to a baseline and achieves more than double the inference speed compared to static tiling. This approach enables more efficient and accurate UAV-based SAR operations under diverse conditions.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the transferability of improved slicers in slice-based transport for distribution matching in computer vision tasks like image generation and point cloud alignment, aiming at scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scalability issues of Optimal Transport (OT) and study if slicers optimized for one distribution pair can effectively transfer to unseen distribution pairs under distributional shift.

Method: The authors analyze the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework, provide theoretical insights about slicer transferability under slight data distribution perturbations, develop a minibatch formulation of min-STP, and demonstrate empirical evaluation across tasks.

Result: The paper shows that optimized slicers remain close under small data distribution changes, enabling efficient transfer. Minibatch min-STP formulation demonstrates strong one-shot matching performance and scalability in tasks like point cloud alignment.

Conclusion: The study confirms optimized slicers' transferability across related distributions, showcasing min-STP as an efficient and scalable solution for distribution matching tasks.

Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) offers a powerful framework for finding correspondences between distributions and addressing matching and alignment problems in various areas of computer vision, including shape analysis, image generation, and multimodal tasks. The computation cost of OT, however, hinders its scalability. Slice-based transport plans have recently shown promise for reducing the computational cost by leveraging the closed-form solutions of 1D OT problems. These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks. To further improve scalability, we introduce a minibatch formulation of min-STP and provide statistical guarantees on its accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transferable min-STP achieves strong one-shot matching performance and facilitates amortized training for point cloud alignment and flow-based generative modeling.

Conclusion: The study highlights the utility of pathology foundation models for clinical applications and positions PathFMTools as a valuable resource for adaptation and validation workflows.

Abstract: Despite the promise of computational pathology foundation models, adapting them to specific clinical tasks remains challenging due to the complexity of whole-slide image (WSI) processing, the opacity of learned features, and the wide range of potential adaptation strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce PathFMTools, a lightweight, extensible Python package that enables efficient execution, analysis, and visualization of pathology foundation models. We use this tool to interface with and evaluate two state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models, CONCH and MUSK, on the task of histological grading in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a critical criterion that informs cSCC staging and patient management. Using a cohort of 440 cSCC H&E WSIs, we benchmark multiple adaptation strategies, demonstrating trade-offs across prediction approaches and validating the potential of using foundation model embeddings to train small specialist models. These findings underscore the promise of pathology foundation models for real-world clinical applications, with PathFMTools enabling efficient analysis and validation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents "Prune-Then-Plan" to address inefficiencies in vision-language models (VLMs) for embodied question answering (EQA), improving navigation and answer quality by reinforcing step-level calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address issues caused by overconfidence and miscalibration in VLM-based EQA agents, which lead to inefficient navigation and unstable frontier oscillations during step-level exploration.

Method: The authors propose "Prune-Then-Plan," a two-step framework, where implausible frontier choices are pruned using a Holm-Bonferroni-like method, and final decisions are delegated to a coverage-based planner, creating more stable, conservative actions from VLMs.

Result: The proposed method improved 3D-Mem EQA performance, achieving up to 49% and 33% better visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match scores respectively, and provided enhanced scene coverage on OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets under the same exploration limits.

Conclusion: "Prune-Then-Plan" effectively stabilizes VLM behavior in EQA, reduces inefficiencies, and enhances answer quality by introducing step-level calibration, thus proving an effective solution to VLM overconfidence.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved embodied question answering (EQA) agents by providing strong semantic priors for open-vocabulary reasoning. However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines. Overall, our method achieves better scene coverage under equal exploration budgets on both OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach to species detection using multimodal prototype networks that are interpretable, cost-aware, and selective in using genetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring ecosystems and detecting species are critical for conservation, but current deep learning methods lack interpretability and require expensive, invasive genetic data collection.

Method: The authors extend prototype networks (ProtoPNets) to a multimodal setting, ensembling prototypes from various modalities and introducing methods to selectively allocate genetic data depending on prediction confidence.

Result: The proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to models using both image and genetic data while reducing reliance on expensive genetic information by using it only when necessary.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that multimodal prototype networks can maintain accuracy, improve cost-efficiency, and enhance interpretability in species detection tasks.

Abstract: Species detection is important for monitoring the health of ecosystems and identifying invasive species, serving a crucial role in guiding conservation efforts. Multimodal neural networks have seen increasing use for identifying species to help automate this task, but they have two major drawbacks. First, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of their decision making process. Second, collecting genetic data is often expensive and requires invasive procedures, often necessitating researchers to capture or kill the target specimen. We address both of these problems by extending prototype networks (ProtoPNets), which are a popular and interpretable alternative to traditional neural networks, to the multimodal, cost-aware setting. We ensemble prototypes from each modality, using an associated weight to determine how much a given prediction relies on each modality. We further introduce methods to identify cases for which we do not need the expensive genetic information to make confident predictions. We demonstrate that our approach can intelligently allocate expensive genetic data for fine-grained distinctions while using abundant image data for clearer visual classifications and achieving comparable accuracy to models that consistently use both modalities.

Abstract: World models are emerging as a foundational paradigm for scalable, data-efficient embodied AI. In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce reliance on extensive expert annotations for medical image segmentation by incorporating vision-language models into semi-supervised learning frameworks.

Method: The approach consists of training a segmentation assistant (VESSA) as reference-guided using exemplar templates, followed by integrating it into SSL frameworks, creating a dynamic feedback loop for improved pseudo-label and guidance generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on segmentation datasets demonstrate that VESSA-augmented SSL improves segmentation accuracy significantly while outperforming existing baselines under limited annotation conditions.

Conclusion: Incorporating vision-language understanding into SSL frameworks enhances medical image segmentation capabilities, showcasing effective application under annotation scarcity.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an effective paradigm for medical image segmentation, reducing the reliance on extensive expert annotations. Meanwhile, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization and few-shot capabilities across diverse visual domains. In this work, we integrate VLM-based segmentation into semi-supervised medical image segmentation by introducing a Vision-Language Enhanced Semi-supervised Segmentation Assistant (VESSA) that incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple segmentation datasets and domains show that VESSA-augmented SSL significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under extremely limited annotation conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), a fine-tuning framework for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, achieving better generalization by systematically relaxing proximity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the transfer and generalization of pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks, without harming their robust pretrained priors.

Method: MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling) is proposed, which schedules the relaxation of proximity constraints for model components, allowing visual encoders to retain pretrained priors while enabling flexibility for action-oriented language layers.

Result: The MAPS framework consistently improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance across various test setups and challenging benchmarks, with performance increases reaching up to 30%.

Conclusion: MAPS effectively balances stability and flexibility in fine-tuning VLA models, preserving broad generalization through an empirically guided approach that respects pretrained VLM priors.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models inherit strong priors from pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but naive fine-tuning often disrupts these representations and harms generalization. Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%). Our findings highlight empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs as a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer.

*Linxin Hua,Jianghua Deng,Ye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel feature, relative angle, to address challenges in 3D damage point cloud reconstruction, reducing data storage requirements while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of image-based methods prone to background noise in damage reconstruction and the high data volume involved in 3D point clouds.

Method: The study calculates a single-dimensional feature called relative angle and evaluates its performance through entropy analysis and PointNet++ modeling.

Result: Relative angle retains relevant damage information, dismisses redundant undamaged information, reduces storage by 27.6%, compresses input channels by 83%, and achieves similar performance as normal vector-based models.

Conclusion: Relative angle optimizes resource use for damage point cloud reconstruction, enabling efficient operation on hardware without altering model architecture.

Abstract: Point cloud reconstruction of damage offers an effective solution to image-based methods vulnerable to background noise, yet its application is constrained by the high volume of 3D data. This study proposes a new feature, relative angle, computed as the angle between the normal vector of a point and the average normal vector of its parent point cloud. This single-dimensional feature provides directionality information equivalent to normal vectors for concrete surface defect characteristics. Through entropy-based feature evaluation, this study demonstrates the ability of relative angle to filter out redundant information in undamaged sections while retaining effective information in damaged sections. By training and testing with PointNet++, models based on the relative angles achieved similar performance to that of models based on normal vectors while delivering 27.6% storage reduction and 83% input channel compression. This novel feature has the potential to enable larger-batch execution on resource-constrained hardware without the necessity of architectural modifications to models.

### [121] [Lightweight Transformer Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19765)
*Ali Torabi,Sanjog Gaihre,Yaqoob Majeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrispFormer enhances SegFormer for weakly supervised semantic segmentation using minimal changes, improving boundary precision, small-object recall, and mIoU through efficient mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve weakly supervised semantic segmentation by addressing challenges of noisy and under-specified cues while maintaining computational simplicity.

Method: Three modifications: (1) boundary branch with edge-aware loss, (2) uncertainty-guided refiner for weighting losses, and (3) dynamic multi-scale fusion with spatial softmax gating.

Result: Significant improvement in boundary preservation, small-object recall, and overall mask quality (mIoU) compared to SegFormer baselines, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: CrispFormer effectively enhances SegFormer with minimal complexity, offering robust semantic segmentation with higher fidelity using weak supervision.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) must learn dense masks from noisy, under-specified cues. We revisit the SegFormer decoder and show that three small, synergistic changes make weak supervision markedly more effective-without altering the MiT backbone or relying on heavy post-processing. Our method, CrispFormer, augments the decoder with: (1) a boundary branch that supervises thin object contours using a lightweight edge head and a boundary-aware loss; (2) an uncertainty-guided refiner that predicts per-pixel aleatoric uncertainty and uses it to weight losses and gate a residual correction of the segmentation logits; and (3) a dynamic multi-scale fusion layer that replaces static concatenation with spatial softmax gating over multi-resolution features, optionally modulated by uncertainty. The result is a single-pass model that preserves crisp boundaries, selects appropriate scales per location, and resists label noise from weak cues. Integrated into a standard WSSS pipeline (seed, student, and EMA relabeling), CrispFormer consistently improves boundary F-score, small-object recall, and mIoU over SegFormer baselines trained on the same seeds, while adding minimal compute. Our decoder-centric formulation is simple to implement, broadly compatible with existing SegFormer variants, and offers a reproducible path to higher-fidelity masks from image-level supervision.

*Debin Meng,Chen Jin,Zheng Gao,Yanran Li,Ioannis Patras,Georgios Tzimiropoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TPSO, a module that boosts image diversity in text-to-image diffusion models without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often produce low-diversity and repetitive outputs due to mode collapse in the learned distribution.

Method: TPSO is a training-free, model-agnostic module that uses optimization in the token-prompt embedding space to explore underrepresented regions while maintaining semantic constraints to prevent quality degradation.

Result: TPSO significantly improves generative diversity, raising performance metrics from 1.10 to 4.18 points in experiments conducted on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones.

Conclusion: TPSO effectively enhances image diversity in diffusion models without sacrificing quality, promising better creative exploration and utility in applications.

Abstract: Image diversity remains a fundamental challenge for text-to-image diffusion models. Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper presents Reasoning-VLA, a model enhancing efficiency, generalization, and decision-making in autonomous driving tasks, achieving superior performance and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models struggle with slow inference and limited generalization to new vehicle configurations and driving scenarios.

Method: They introduce Reasoning-VLA, which employs learnable action queries initialized via Gaussian sampling and utilizes reasoning-enhanced vision-language features for parallel action trajectory generation.

Result: Reasoning-VLA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, better generalization capabilities, and faster inference speeds across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves autonomous driving systems' performance and efficiency, solidifying its viability for complex driving scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong decision-making capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing VLAs often struggle with achieving efficient inference and generalizing to novel autonomous vehicle configurations and driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose Reasoning-VLA, a general and fast action-generation VLA framework. The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date.

*Miguel Carvalho,Helder Dias,Bruno Martins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CropVLM is an efficient external reinforcement learning-based method enhancing Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) fine-grained image understanding without requiring human-labeled data or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fall short on tasks demanding detailed visual comprehension due to limitations in perception and image fragmentation. The study motivates developing solutions to improve these shortcomings.

Method: CropVLM employs reinforcement learning to dynamically focus on relevant image regions. It avoids using human-labeled bounding boxes or synthetic datasets and trains independently from specific VLM models.

Result: The model significantly improves performance on fine-grained, high-resolution tasks, particularly in out-of-domain benchmarks, without modifying or retraining the VLM.

Conclusion: CropVLM enhances VLMs' performance efficiently and flexibly without reliance on expensive labeling or the risk of catastrophic forgetting, making it adaptable to various VLM architectures.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with tasks that require fine-grained image understanding, such as scene-text recognition or document analysis, due to perception limitations and visual fragmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce CropVLM as an external low-cost method for boosting performance, enabling VLMs to dynamically ''zoom in'' on relevant image regions, enhancing their ability to capture fine details. CropVLM is trained using reinforcement learning, without using human-labeled bounding boxes as a supervision signal, and without expensive synthetic evaluations. The model is trained once and can be paired with both open-source and proprietary VLMs to improve their performance. Our approach delivers significant improvements on tasks that require high-resolution image understanding, notably for benchmarks that are out-of-domain for the target VLM, without modifying or fine-tuning the VLM, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAP-World is a multi-modal planning framework for autonomous driving which avoids handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning, instead using masked action planning and a path-weighted world model to generate diverse, temporally consistent trajectory modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current motion planning systems in autonomous driving, such as discarding information about alternative futures and the reliance on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning.

Method: MAP-World employs Masked Action Planning (MAP) for diverse trajectory generation and a path-weighted world model for future semantic rollouts. It uses a latent planning state expanded into trajectory queries with noise and computes semantic losses from trajectory probabilities.

Result: MAP-World matches or surpasses anchor-based approaches and sets a new performance benchmark among world-model-based methods on the NAVSIM platform, maintaining real-time inference latency.

Conclusion: MAP-World offers a computationally efficient, multi-modal planning solution for autonomous driving that eliminates the reliance on time-intensive methods like reinforcement learning and handcrafted anchors, enhancing optimization while considering alternative futures.

Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous driving must handle multiple plausible futures while remaining computationally efficient. Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path. On NAVSIM, our method matches anchor-based approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance among world-model-based methods, while avoiding reinforcement learning and maintaining real-time inference latency.

### [126] [One Attention, One Scale: Phase-Aligned Rotary Positional Embeddings for Mixed-Resolution Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19778)
*Haoyu Wu,Jingyi Xu,Qiaomu Miao,Dimitris Samaras,Hieu Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA) to resolve failures in mixed-resolution denoising with Diffusion Transformers caused by phase aliasing in rotary positional embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the structural failure that occurs when conventional linear interpolation methods cause phase aliasing, destabilizing attention mechanisms in pretrained Diffusion Transformers during mixed-resolution denoising.

Method: CRPA modifies the RoPE index map in attention calls, aligning Q/K positions on the query's stride to maintain consistent phase patterns. It is training-free, fully compatible with pretrained models, and uniformly stabilizes all heads and layers.

Result: CRPA enables robust and high-quality mixed-resolution generation, surpassing prior state-of-the-art techniques in image and video generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CRPA method eliminates the core failure mode associated with mixed-resolution generation in Diffusion Transformers, providing a reliable drop-in solution that improves performance and stability.

Abstract: We identify a core failure mode that occurs when using the usual linear interpolation on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) for mixed-resolution denoising with Diffusion Transformers. When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse.
  To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly. We demonstrate that CRPA enables high-fidelity and efficient mixed-resolution generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on image and video generation.

### [127] [Reading Between the Lines: Abstaining from VLM-Generated OCR Errors via Latent Representation Probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19806)
*Jihan Yao,Achin Kulshrestha,Nathalie Rauschmayr,Reed Roberts,Banghua Zhu,Yulia Tsvetkov,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach named Latent Representation Probing (LRP) to improve Visual-Language Models (VLMs) in abstaining when uncertain, especially in Scene Text Visual Question Answering (STVQA) tasks, by detecting uncertainty signals from internal states rather than outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need for reliability in safety-critical applications like STVQA, where VLMs making errors (e.g., misreading traffic signs) could lead to severe consequences. Existing methods for abstention based on output probabilities or semantic agreement fail, highlighting the necessity to explore internal representations for uncertainty detection.

Method: The authors propose LRP, which involves training lightweight probes on VLMs' hidden states or attention patterns. They design three types of probes: concatenating representations across layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling probes by majority vote from single layers.

Result: Through experiments on four datasets, LRP enhances abstention accuracy by 7.6% compared to previous baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of probing internal representations for confidence signals.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that optimal confidence signals are found in intermediate layers of VLMs rather than final outputs, providing a robust framework for abstention in AI systems deployed in safety-critical environments.

Abstract: As VLMs are deployed in safety-critical applications, their ability to abstain from answering when uncertain becomes crucial for reliability, especially in Scene Text Visual Question Answering (STVQA) tasks. For example, OCR errors like misreading "50 mph" as "60 mph" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.
  Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs.

*Yuefei Chen,Jiang Liu,Xiaodong Lin,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CounterVQA, a benchmark to evaluate counterfactual reasoning capabilities of video-language models (VLMs), and proposes a method, CFGPT, to improve reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored area of counterfactual reasoning in VLMs, which is essential for understanding causal structures in videos and inferring unobserved possibilities.

Method: CounterVQA, a benchmark with three difficulty levels, is developed to assess counterfactual capabilities of VLMs. Additionally, a post-training method named CFGPT is introduced to enhance these capabilities by leveraging the model's language modality.

Result: Evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs perform well on basic counterfactual tasks but struggle with complex multi-hop causal reasoning. The CFGPT method consistently improves performance across all benchmark levels.

Conclusion: CounterVQA fills a critical gap in evaluating video-language reasoning, and CFGPT offers a path forward for advancing counterfactual reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown significant advancements in video understanding, especially in feature alignment, event reasoning, and instruction-following tasks. However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels. Dataset and code will be further released.

TL;DR: The paper presents a camera-only pipeline for 3D reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting, material semantics extraction, and physics-based material assignment for photorealistic and accurate sensor simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-camera fusion methods face challenges like calibration complexity and poor representation of materials (e.g., glass), prompting the need for a simpler and more effective approach.

Method: The authors propose using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images for reconstruction, extracting semantic material masks via vision models, converting Gaussian data to mesh surfaces with material labels, and assigning physics-based properties.

Result: The method achieves comparable fidelity to LiDAR-camera fusion for sensor simulation but avoids calibration and hardware complexities. Validation was done using an internal dataset from a test vehicle, with LiDAR reflectivity as ground truth and image similarity metrics.

Conclusion: This camera-only approach simplifies 3D reconstruction by eliminating the need for LiDAR while achieving photorealistic results suitable for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics.

TL;DR: BRIC is a test-time adaptation framework enabling realistic long-term human motion generation by combining diffusion-based motion planning with reinforcement learning-based physics controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of execution discrepancies in human motion generation caused by diffusion models producing unrealistic and physically implausible outputs.

Method: BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller at test-time using a loss function to prevent skill forgetting and introduces a lightweight guidance mechanism to adjust the diffusion model without altering its parameters.

Result: BRIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long-term tasks such as motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction.

Conclusion: BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term human motion simulation across diverse environments through effective test-time adaptation techniques.

Abstract: We propose BRIC, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enables long-term human motion generation by resolving execution discrepancies between diffusion-based kinematic motion planners and reinforcement learning-based physics controllers. While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner. We validate the effectiveness of BRIC on a variety of long-term tasks, including motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of previous video retake generation methods, particularly with camera motion and video length inconsistencies.

Method: It introduces Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE) to integrate multi-view relationships and rectify positional misuses in past techniques.

Result: The approach demonstrates enhanced dynamic object localization, static background preservation, and camera control across varying conditions.

Conclusion: ReDirector is effective in improving video retake generation quality, showcasing better camera handling and overall video coherence in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We present ReDirector, a novel camera-controlled video retake generation method for dynamically captured variable-length videos. In particular, we rectify a common misuse of RoPE in previous works by aligning the spatiotemporal positions of the input video and the target retake. Moreover, we introduce Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE), a camera-conditioned RoPE phase shift that captures and integrates multi-view relationships within and across the input and target videos. By integrating camera conditions into RoPE, our method generalizes to out-of-distribution camera trajectories and video lengths, yielding improved dynamic object localization and static background preservation. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements in camera controllability, geometric consistency, and video quality across various trajectories and lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning struggles with limited clinical datasets and similar disease characteristics within Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs). Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise but lack domain-specific knowledge, increasing diagnostic errors.

Method: The proposed BHD-RAG framework incorporates imaging descriptions and clinical evidence retrieval from a multimodal corpus, combined with cosine similarity-based methods and MLLM integration to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

Result: BHD-RAG outperformed existing methods, showcasing improved diagnostic accuracy and generating detailed evidence closely aligned with expert assessments.

Conclusion: The BHD-RAG framework successfully integrates medical expertise and machine learning to address rare disease diagnosis challenges, emphasizing its utility in clinical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning methods face dual challenges of limited clinical samples and low inter-class differentiation among Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs) in advancing Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) diagnosis via Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate diagnostic potential fo such rare diseases, the absence of domain-specific knowledge and referable radiological features intensify hallucination risks. To address this problem, we propose BHD-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates DCLD-specific expertise and clinical precedents with MLLMs to improve BHD diagnostic accuracy. BHDRAG employs: (1) a specialized agent generating imaging manifestation descriptions of CT images to construct a multimodal corpus of DCLDs cases. (2) a cosine similarity-based retriever pinpointing relevant imagedescription pairs for query images, and (3) an MLLM synthesizing retrieved evidence with imaging data for diagnosis. BHD-RAG is validated on the dataset involving four types of DCLDs, achieving superior accuracy and generating evidence-based descriptions closely aligned with expert insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in embodied AI tasks, where reproducible, closed-loop evaluation in realistic environments is lacking due to visual and geometric gaps in current simulation methods.

Method: The proposed method, Wanderland, combines multi-sensor capture and high-quality reconstruction to create a photorealistic simulation pipeline and urban datasets.

Result: This framework demonstrates improved reliability of embodied navigation evaluations and benchmarking capabilities for tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: Wanderland establishes a new standard for reproducible and reliable embodied AI research in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Reproducible closed-loop evaluation remains a major bottleneck in Embodied AI such as visual navigation. A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models. Our work establishes a new foundation for reproducible research in open-world embodied AI. Project website is at https://ai4ce.github.io/wanderland/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve performance degradation caused by attention sparsity in video generation transformers, particularly due to biases resulting from focusing only on critical tokens and neglecting non-critical ones.

Method: The authors developed Rectified SpaAttn with two key components: Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation for proper token focus correction, and Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification to balance gains and pooling errors for non-critical tokens.

Result: Rectified SpaAttn achieved up to 3.33x and 2.08x faster speeds on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1 while preserving high generation quality.

Conclusion: Rectified SpaAttn successfully addresses computation and attention biases in sparse attention, improving efficiency and video generation quality while being accessible as an open-source tool.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers dominate video generation, but the quadratic complexity of attention computation introduces substantial latency. Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality. We release Rectified SpaAttn as open-source at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn .

*Yiting Lu,Wei Luo,Peiyan Tu,Haoran Li,Hanxin Zhu,Zihao Yu,Xingrui Wang,Xinyi Chen,Xinge Peng,Xin Li,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Generation Models advance beyond 2D visual generation to create realistic 3D/4D worlds, evaluated systematically by the introduced 4DWorldBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing benchmarks that focus unevenly on different dimensions of evaluating world-realism capabilities of World Generation Models.

Method: Introduce the 4DWorldBench benchmark using multiple evaluation metrics—Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency—and employ adaptive tools like unified textual mapping and LLM-as-judge for systematic assessment.

Result: The benchmark demonstrates improved consistency across multimodal inputs evaluation and closer alignment with human judgments, validated through preliminary human studies.

Conclusion: 4DWorldBench offers a unified method to evaluate World Generation Models, supporting fair comparisons and advancements from visual generation to immersive world generation technologies.

Abstract: World Generation Models are emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation multimodal intelligence systems. Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from "visual generation" to "world generation."

*Thomas M Metz,Matthew Q Hill,Alice J O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a multitasking approach using foundation models to handle object, face, and person recognition tasks simultaneously without catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address catastrophic forgetting in models when fine-tuned for specific tasks while enabling them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a unified embedding space.

Method: They propose two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC) that fine-tunes foundation model backbones simultaneously on multiple tasks using a gradient-coupled, interleaving training strategy.

Result: Their method shows effectiveness with models like DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02, achieving performance comparable to domain experts and surpassing human abilities in multitasking across face, body, and object datasets, while preserving out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: IMIC achieves effective multitasking with minimal catastrophic forgetting, preserving generalization while maintaining task performance and showcasing shared features within a unified embedding space.

Abstract: Vision foundation models can perform generalized object classification in zero-shot mode, and face/person recognition when they are fine-tuned. However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks. Fewer than 100 PCs calculated from any one task could perform all other tasks with nearly zero performance degradation.

### [137] [DesignPref: Capturing Personal Preferences in Visual Design Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20513)
*Yi-Hao Peng,Jeffrey P. Bigham,Jason Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DesignPref, a dataset focused on personalized visual design preferences, revealing substantial disagreement among professional designers and proposing personalization strategies for modeling individual tastes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving how generative models address subjective and personalized visual design preferences, which vary widely among individuals.

Method: The authors created DesignPref, a dataset of 12,000 pairwise comparisons annotated by professional designers and utilized personalization strategies like fine-tuning and designer-specific annotations within models.

Result: Personalized models trained on designer-specific annotations excel in predicting individual preferences, performing better than aggregated models even with fewer examples.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of personalized approaches to model individual design taste, paving the way for future research in personalized visual design evaluation.

Abstract: Generative models, such as large language models and text-to-image diffusion models, are increasingly used to create visual designs like user interfaces (UIs) and presentation slides. Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples. Our work provides the first dataset to study personalized visual design evaluation and support future research into modeling individual design taste.

*Jiahui Sun,Junran Lu,Jinhui Yin,Yishuo Xu,Yuanqi Li,Yanwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOGE, a novel framework to extract road networks as Bézier Graphs directly from segmentation masks, bypassing the need for vector ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional polyline-based road network extraction that poorly represent curvilinear geometries, proposing a method that aligns better with curve-based road structures.

Method: The paper reframes road network extraction as a global optimization problem over parametric Bézier Graphs, utilizing two alternating modules, DiffAlign for geometric optimization using differentiable rendering and TopoAdapt for topological refinement using discrete operators.

Result: The proposed DOGE framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale road network benchmarks such as SpaceNet and CityScale.

Conclusion: DOGE represents a paradigm shift in extracting high-fidelity vector maps of road networks, effectively modeling curvilinear geometry without the need for vector ground-truth. The code and data will be released to the community.

Abstract: Automatic extraction of road networks from aerial imagery is a fundamental task, yet prevailing methods rely on polylines that struggle to model curvilinear geometry. We maintain that road geometry is inherently curve-based and introduce the Bézier Graph, a differentiable parametric curve-based representation. The primary obstacle to this representation is to obtain the difficult-to-construct vector ground-truth (GT). We sidestep this bottleneck by reframing the task as a global optimization problem over the Bézier Graph. Our framework, DOGE, operationalizes this paradigm by learning a parametric Bézier Graph directly from segmentation masks, eliminating the need for curve GT. DOGE holistically optimizes the graph by alternating between two complementary modules: DiffAlign continuously optimizes geometry via differentiable rendering, while TopoAdapt uses discrete operators to refine its topology. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale SpaceNet and CityScale benchmarks, presenting a new paradigm for generating high-fidelity vector maps of road networks. We will release our code and related data.

*Yuwei Niu,Weiyang Jin,Jiaqi Liao,Chaoran Feng,Peng Jin,Bin Lin,Zongjian Li,Bin Zhu,Weihao Yu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the understanding-generation gap in Unified Multimodal Models using the UniSandbox framework and controlled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if model understanding informs its generation and address the gap between reasoning and knowledge transfer in multimodal models.

Method: Introduced UniSandbox—an evaluation framework with synthetic, controlled datasets to analyze the understanding-generation gap. Employed Chain-of-Thought for reasoning and self-training methods.

Result: Found explicit Chain-of-Thought bridges reasoning gaps and aids knowledge retrieval during generation. Query-based architectures have latent CoT-like properties improving transfer.

Conclusion: Insights suggest new paths to enhance unified architecture designs and strategies for seamlessly linking understanding with generation.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

### [140] [STAvatar: Soft Binding and Temporal Density Control for Monocular 3D Head Avatars Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19854)
*Jiankuo Zhao,Xiangyu Zhu,Zidu Wang,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAvatar is a novel approach for reconstructing high-fidelity and animatable 3D head avatars from monocular videos by introducing UV-Adaptive Soft Binding and Temporal ADC strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing methods for 3D head avatar reconstruction, such as rigid motions, limited expressiveness, and challenges in handling frequently occluded regions.

Method: The proposed STAvatar framework includes two key components: UV-Adaptive Soft Binding for dynamic resampling and enhanced adaptability, and Temporal ADC for targeted densification using a fused perceptual error criterion.

Result: STAvatar outperforms previous methods on benchmark datasets, effectively capturing fine details and reconstructing occluded regions.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves the reconstruction performance of 3D head avatars and will contribute to advancing the field with plans for public code release.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity and animatable 3D head avatars from monocular videos remains a challenging yet essential task. Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAvatar achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions. The code will be publicly available.

*Xiangkai Ma,Han Zhang,Wenzhong Li,Sanglu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeArtist introduces a novel temporal-visual conversion framework that aligns time series with visual concepts to generate high-quality images capturing temporal fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches converting time series into pseudo-images fail to establish semantic-level alignment, leaving the potential of linking time series and images unexplored.

Method: TimeArtist employs a self-supervised dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer to create shared representations between temporal and visual data. It utilizes a 'warmup-align' paradigm to align data at the representation level, allowing image generation directly from time series.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that TimeArtist generates diverse, high-quality images directly from time series and achieves superior zero-shot performance in temporal tasks.

Conclusion: TimeArtist bridges the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics, establishing a path forward for cross-modal content generation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in aligning and generating content across text and image modalities. However, the potential of using non-visual, continuous sequential, as a conditioning signal for high-fidelity image generation remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, existing methods that convert series into "pseudo-images" for temporal forecasting fail to establish semantic-level alignment. In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a "warmup-align" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level. TimeArtist establishes a versatile cross-modal framework, enabling high-quality, diverse image generation directly from time series, while capturing temporal fluctuation patterns to render images as styles transfer. Extensive experiments show that TimeArtist achieves satisfactory performance in image generation metrics, while also attaining superior results in zero-shot temporal tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal generation, bridging the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ChessMamba, a novel structure-aware framework for change detection in multi-temporal remote sensing imagery, addressing issues of misalignment with innovations like chessboard interleaving and structure-aware fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges of heterogeneity and spatiotemporal misalignment in fine-grained recognition for change detection in remote sensing imagery.

Method: The proposed method, ChessMamba, utilizes chessboard interleaving for feature serialization and multi-dilated convolutions for structure-aware fusion, ensuring robust handling of multi-temporal inputs.

Result: ChessMamba achieves significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods in various change detection tasks, such as binary CD, semantic CD, and multimodal building damage assessment.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that structure-aware techniques can effectively address challenges in multi-temporal change detection, advancing the reliability and accuracy of remote sensing imagery analysis.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) in multitemporal remote sensing imagery presents significant challenges for fine-grained recognition, owing to heterogeneity and spatiotemporal misalignment. However, existing methodologies based on vision transformers or state-space models typically disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization. To address this, we introduce ChessMamba, a structure-aware framework leveraging interleaved state-space modeling for robust CD with multi-temporal inputs. ChessMamba integrates a SpatialMamba encoder with a lightweight cross-source interaction module, featuring two key innovations: (i) Chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order, which serializes multi-temporal features into a unified sequence within a single forward pass, thereby shortening interaction paths and enabling direct comparison for accurate change localization; and (ii) Structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions, selectively capturing center-and-corner neighborhood contexts within each mono-temporal. Comprehensive evaluations on three CD tasks, including binary CD, semantic CD and multimodal building damage assessment, demonstrate that ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.The relevant code will be available at: github.com/DingLei14/ChessMamba.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method to overcome challenges in cross-modal knowledge distillation by using frequency-decoupled techniques, leading to better performance over benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of traditional knowledge distillation methods in cross-modal applications due to inconsistent representations between modalities.

Method: The method decouples features into low- and high-frequency domains, aligns them with tailored losses, utilizes a scale consistency loss for adapting modality shifts, and employs a shared classifier to unify feature spaces.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art cross-modal knowledge distillation methods across various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation offers a more effective way to align inconsistent modality representations, advancing the field of cross-modal knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has proven highly effective for compressing large models and enhancing the performance of smaller ones. However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited application scope and dataset constraints in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for liver lesions.

Method: Constructed a multi-task liver dataset, LiMT, based on CT scans with annotations by experienced clinicians, enabling multi-task correlations without dataset heterogeneity concerns.

Result: LiMT includes 150 CT volumes covering four liver diseases and normal cases, with relevant baseline results and reviews of existing datasets/methods presented.

Conclusion: LiMT provides a valuable public resource for advancing liver-focused medical imaging research.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology can assist clinicians in evaluating liver lesions and intervening with treatment in time. Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future. In addition, this paper not only provides relevant baseline experimental results but also reviews existing datasets and methods related to liver-related tasks.

TL;DR: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) face challenges in answering questions about scientific figures due to limitations and lack of high-quality datasets. This paper presents a scalable Generate-then-Verify framework to address these issues, resulting in the creation of the VeriSciQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LVLMs struggle with Scientific Visual Question Answering (SVQA) due to limited public, high-quality datasets and systematic errors in synthesized QA pairs.

Method: The paper introduces a Generate-then-Verify framework which generates QA pairs using figure-associated textual contexts and applies cross-modal consistency checks and filters to enhance data quality.

Result: The study curates the VeriSciQA dataset containing 20,351 QA pairs across diverse scientific domains and demonstrates its benchmarking value, with a noticeable accuracy gap between open-source models and proprietary systems.

Conclusion: VeriSciQA improves SVQA benchmark performance in LVLMs, with scalable framework potential to further advance SVQA capabilities in the open-source community.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for scientific applications, yet open-source models still struggle with Scientific Visual Question Answering (SVQA), namely answering questions about figures from scientific papers. A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%). Moreover, models fine-tuned on VeriSciQA achieve consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks, with performance gains that scale with data size and surpass models trained on existing datasets. Human evaluation further validates the superior correctness of VeriSciQA. Together, these evidences demonstrate that continued data expansion by our scalable framework can further advance SVQA capability in the open-source community.

TL;DR: Agent0-VL is a vision-language agent that utilizes tool-integrated reasoning for self-evaluation and continual improvement, achieving a 12.5% performance boost without human annotations or external rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language agents still face limitations in learning from human-annotated supervision. Self-rewarding approaches are emerging but struggle with verifying complex visual reasoning and often encounter hallucinations in evaluation.

Method: Agent0-VL employs tool-integrated reasoning in self-evaluation and self-repair through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, enabling the model to verify and refine its reasoning. It combines Solver and Verifier roles that interact to align reasoning and evaluation distributions.

Result: Agent0-VL achieves a 12.5% improvement over its base model in tasks like geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis, demonstrating its effectiveness in zero-external-reward evolution.

Conclusion: By incorporating tools into reasoning and evaluation, Agent0-VL achieves continual self-improvement without relying on human annotations or external reward systems, paving the way for advanced vision-language agents.

Abstract: Vision-language agents have achieved remarkable progress in a variety of multimodal reasoning tasks; however, their learning remains constrained by the limitations of human-annotated supervision. Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

TL;DR: The paper develops a multimodal approach for continuous American Sign Language (ASL) recognition, focusing on sign segmentation and recognition using 3D features and handshape data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately detecting signs in continuous ASL videos is challenging due to the dynamics at sign boundaries. This paper aims to improve robustness and accuracy for ASL recognition using multimodal and linguistically informed techniques.

Method: The approach involves detecting sign boundaries using machine learning with 3D skeletal features and pretrained handshape classifiers, followed by integrating these components using a multimodal fusion module for improved sign recognition.

Result: The method achieves significant accuracy improvements in boundary detection and sign recognition on the ASLLRP corpus, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework effectively enhances ASL sign recognition by leveraging 3D skeletal and handshape features, advancing the state of the art in continuous sign language recognition.

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal approach for continuous sign recognition that first uses machine learning to detect the start and end frames of signs in videos of American Sign Language (ASL) sentences, and then recognizes the segmented signs. For improved robustness, we use 3D skeletal features extracted from sign language videos to capture the convergence of sign properties and their dynamics, which tend to cluster at sign boundaries. Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets. A multimodal fusion module is then used to unify the pretrained sign video segmentation framework and the handshape classification models. Finally, the estimated boundaries are used for sign recognition, where the recognition model is trained on a large database containing both citation-form isolated signs and signs pre-segmented (based on manual annotations) from continuous signing, as such signs often differ in certain respects. We evaluate our method on the ASLLRP corpus and demonstrate significant improvements over previous work.

*Haoxuan Wang,Jiachen Tao,Junyi Wu,Gaowen Liu,Ramana Rao Kompella,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion Marionette is a zero-shot framework for transferring motion from videos to images without relying on prior constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to motion transfer rely on external priors, creating trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. A new framework without these limitations is needed.

Method: The method uses an internal spatial-temporal prior derived from a unified 3D space of the source video and target image, along with Position-Based Dynamics to refine results and ensure consistency.

Result: The system generates videos that generalize across diverse objects while ensuring motion consistency and controllable video production.

Conclusion: Motion Marionette enables effective, temporally consistent motion transfer free from external constraint trade-offs, supporting versatile and controllable video synthesis.

Abstract: We present Motion Marionette, a zero-shot framework for rigid motion transfer from monocular source videos to single-view target images. Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence. The resulting velocity field can be flexibly employed for efficient video production. Empirical results demonstrate that Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos that align well with the source motion, and supports controllable video generation.

### [149] [Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation: Spatially Decoding Volumetric Photochemical Conversion in Complex 3D-Printed Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19913)
*Maryam Eftekharifar,Churun Zhang,Jialiang Wei,Xudong Cao,Hossein Heidari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for predicting photochemical conversions in 3D printed objects using 3D visual data, leveraging a novel computer vision model and a unique dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in traditional vision models in predicting volumetric physical properties from 3D visual data, focusing on the chemical conversion state in 3D printed objects.

Method: The authors propose a model named Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA) which fuses multimodal data using sparse physical parameters and dynamically adapts visual features through a novel gating approach. It processes raw projection stacks and corrected counterparts through dual 3D-CNNs.

Result: The framework enables accurate prediction of volumetric photochemical properties, eliminating the need for traditional post-print measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances virtual chemical characterization and offers precise control over 3D printed chemical states, addressing a challenging issue in computer vision and materials science.

Abstract: We present a framework that pioneers the prediction of photochemical conversion in complex three-dimensionally printed objects, introducing a challenging new computer vision task: predicting dense, non-visual volumetric physical properties from 3D visual data. This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context. This approach offers a breakthrough in virtual chemical characterisation, eliminating the need for traditional post-print measurements and enabling precise control over the chemical conversion state.

*Qin Ren,Yufei Wang,Lanqing Guo,Wen Zhang,Zhiwen Fan,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoTTS, a framework for localized test-time scaling in diffusion models to enhance text-to-image generation quality by targeting defective regions instead of the entire image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods overlook spatial heterogeneity in image quality, leading to inefficient computations and insufficient corrections of localized defects.

Method: LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts to detect defective regions, refines them into coherent masks, and locally denoises while maintaining global consistency.

Result: LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improves local quality and global fidelity, and reduces GPU costs by 2-4x compared to the best existing methods.

Conclusion: Localized test-time scaling is a promising approach, as demonstrated by its effectiveness and efficiency through LoTTS, marking a pivotal advancement for diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the dominant paradigm in text-to-image generation, and test-time scaling (TTS) further improves quality by allocating more computation during inference. However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling. These findings establish localized TTS as a promising new direction for scaling diffusion models at inference time.

*Yufan Chen,Omar Moured,Ruiping Liu,Junwei Zheng,Kunyu Peng,Jiaming Zhang,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HybriDLA, a method combining diffusion and autoregressive decoding for better document layout analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity and variety in document layouts exceed the capabilities of traditional methods reliant on simpler layouts or fixed query approaches.

Method: HybriDLA integrates diffusion to refine bounding-boxes and autoregressive decoding for semantic/contextual understanding. It employs a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder for improved detection.

Result: HybriDLA achieved 83.5% mAP and outperformed prior methods in DocLayNet and M^6Doc benchmarks.

Conclusion: HybriDLA demonstrates superior performance in document layout analysis and offers new benchmarks, with both data and models made publicly available.

Abstract: Conventional document layout analysis (DLA) traditionally depends on empirical priors or a fixed set of learnable queries executed in a single forward pass. While sufficient for early-generation documents with a small, predetermined number of regions, this paradigm struggles with contemporary documents, which exhibit diverse element counts and increasingly complex layouts. To address challenges posed by modern documents, we present HybriDLA, a novel generative framework that unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding within a single layer. The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues. This architecture elevates performance to 83.5% mean Average Precision (mAP). Extensive experiments on the DocLayNet and M$^6$Doc benchmarks demonstrate that HybriDLA sets a state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous approaches. All data and models will be made publicly available at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/HybriDLA.

### [152] [Intelligent Image Search Algorithms Fusing Visual Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19920)
*Kehan Wang,Tingqiong Cui,Yang Zhang,Yu Chen,Shifeng Wu,Zhenzhang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DetVLM, a framework combining object detection and Visual Large Models (VLMs) to enhance fine-grained image retrieval with state-specific and zero-shot capabilities, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained image retrieval faces challenges including lack of robustness in manual features, limited capabilities of deep learning detectors, and inefficiencies of Visual Large Models.

Method: DetVLM operates with a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector for initial high-recall screening and a VLM for recall enhancement and sophisticated state judgments based on task-specific prompts.

Result: DetVLM achieved state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy of 94.82% on a vehicle component dataset, with significant improvements in zero-shot (94.95%) and state-specific (90%+) search tasks.

Conclusion: DetVLM effectively bridges the gaps of traditional methods and sets a new standard for precise, efficient, and versatile image retrieval in fine-grained scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-grained image retrieval, which aims to find images containing specific object components and assess their detailed states, is critical in fields like security and industrial inspection. However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., "sun visor lowered"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., "driver wearing a mask") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines. It also attains 94.95\% accuracy in zero-shot search for driver mask-wearing and over 90\% average accuracy in state search tasks.

*Janani Kugarajeevan,Thanikasalam Kokul,Amirthalingam Ramanan,Subha Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CPDATrack, a new Transformer-based object tracker that enhances performance by minimizing distractions from background and distractor tokens, leading to state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional one-stream Transformer-based trackers suffer from decreased performance due to excessive background interference and distractor tokens near the target. Pruning methods often exacerbate the issue by removing essential contextual information.

Method: CPDATrack incorporates a learnable module for probabilistic token pruning, preserving context around the target, and uses selective attention mechanisms to refine target detection by filtering background and distractor tokens during tracking.

Result: CPDATrack significantly outperforms existing trackers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks such as GOT-10k with an average overlap of 75.1%.

Conclusion: By effectively addressing background and distractor interference while maintaining essential contextual cues, CPDATrack improves tracking efficiency and accuracy, setting a new benchmark in Transformer-based trackers.

Abstract: One-stream Transformer-based trackers have demonstrated remarkable performance by concatenating template and search region tokens, thereby enabling joint attention across all tokens. However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens. The proposed CPDATrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly on GOT-10k, where it attains an average overlap of 75.1 percent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to utilize the rich semantic structures captured by image diffusion models, originally designed for image generation, for recognition and video object tracking tasks.

Method: The authors reinterpret self-attention maps from diffusion models as semantic label propagation kernels. They introduce test-time optimization strategies like DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting, and propose the DRIFT framework with SAM-guided mask refinement for video object tracking.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks, showing robust and consistent label propagation capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that image diffusion models can be effectively repurposed for video object tracking through semantic label propagation and optimization strategies, presenting DRIFT as a novel and high-performing solution.

Abstract: Image diffusion models, though originally developed for image generation, implicitly capture rich semantic structures that enable various recognition and localization tasks beyond synthesis. In this work, we investigate their self-attention maps can be reinterpreted as semantic label propagation kernels, providing robust pixel-level correspondences between relevant image regions. Extending this mechanism across frames yields a temporal propagation kernel that enables zero-shot object tracking via segmentation in videos. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing approaches are limited to low-resolution settings, highlighting the need for effective manipulation methods for high-resolution images.

Method: A test-time optimization framework with patch-wise optimization, a fine-grained detail transfer module, and synchronization strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the approach's capacity to deliver high-quality image edits.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances high-resolution content creation and enhances controllable image editing.

Abstract: High-resolution content creation is rapidly emerging as a central challenge in both the vision and graphics communities. While images serve as the most fundamental modality for visual expression, content generation that aligns with the user intent requires effective, controllable high-resolution image manipulation mechanisms. However, existing approaches remain limited to low-resolution settings, typically supporting only up to 1K resolution. In this work, we introduce the task of high-resolution image editing and propose a test-time optimization framework to address it. Our method performs patch-wise optimization on high-resolution source images, followed by a fine-grained detail transfer module and a novel synchronization strategy to maintain consistency across patches. Extensive experiments show that our method produces high-quality edits, facilitating the way toward high-resolution content creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for scalable, accurate, and training-free methods in nuclear instance segmentation for computational pathology, overcoming the limitations of dense supervision and retraining requirements.

Method: SPROUT constructs slide-specific reference prototypes using histology-informed priors and partial optimal transport, leveraging these as prompts for the SAM model to delineate nuclei without parameter updates or supervision.

Result: SPROUT achieves competitive segmentation performance across various histopathology benchmarks without requiring any training or annotation.

Conclusion: SPROUT establishes a scalable, novel approach for precise and training-free nuclear segmentation in pathology, eliminating the need for traditional supervision and retraining.

Abstract: Accurate nuclear instance segmentation is a pivotal task in computational pathology, supporting data-driven clinical insights and facilitating downstream translational applications. While large vision foundation models have shown promise for zero-shot biomedical segmentation, most existing approaches still depend on dense supervision and computationally expensive fine-tuning. Consequently, training-free methods present a compelling research direction, yet remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce SPROUT, a fully training- and annotation-free prompting framework for nuclear instance segmentation. SPROUT leverages histology-informed priors to construct slide-specific reference prototypes that mitigate domain gaps. These prototypes progressively guide feature alignment through a partial optimal transport scheme. The resulting foreground and background features are transformed into positive and negative point prompts, enabling the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to produce precise nuclear delineations without any parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple histopathology benchmarks demonstrate that SPROUT achieves competitive performance without supervision or retraining, establishing a novel paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in pathology.

Motivation: To address the need for secure and privacy-preserving biometric systems suitable for high-security applications while dealing with vulnerabilities like illumination and pose variations.

Method: The framework combines Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to extract spectral features from 3D face meshes.

Conclusion: GFT-GCN successfully balances privacy and performance, providing a robust solution for secure 3D face authentication in high-security applications.

Abstract: 3D face recognition offers a robust biometric solution by capturing facial geometry, providing resilience to variations in illumination, pose changes, and presentation attacks. Its strong spoof resistance makes it suitable for high-security applications, but protecting stored biometric templates remains critical. We present GFT-GCN, a privacy-preserving 3D face recognition framework that combines spectral graph learning with diffusion-based template protection. Our approach integrates the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to extract compact, discriminative spectral features from 3D face meshes. To secure these features, we introduce a spectral diffusion mechanism that produces irreversible, renewable, and unlinkable templates. A lightweight client-server architecture ensures that raw biometric data never leaves the client device.

TL;DR: This paper proposes MambaEye, a causal sequential visual encoder optimized for arbitrary image sizes using State Space Models and relative move embeddings. It achieves scalable performance with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing visual encoders that are sensitive to input image sizes and lack true input-size agnosticism, aiming to replicate characteristics of human vision.

Method: Introduced MambaEye with unidirectional causal sequential processing, relative move embeddings for translation invariance, and diffusion-inspired loss for step-wise supervision.

Result: MambaEye performs robustly across varying image resolutions, including high resolutions like 1536x1536, for tasks such as ImageNet-1K classification, while maintaining linear time/memory complexity.

Conclusion: MambaEye offers a scalable and input-size agnostic solution for visual encoding with inherent adaptability to diverse resolutions and scanning patterns, marking progress toward replicating human vision properties.

Abstract: Despite decades of progress, a truly input-size agnostic visual encoder-a fundamental characteristic of human vision-has remained elusive. We address this limitation by proposing \textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a novel diffusion-inspired loss function that provides dense, step-wise supervision, training the model to build confidence as it gathers more visual evidence. We demonstrate that MambaEye exhibits robust performance across a wide range of image resolutions, especially at higher resolutions such as $1536^2$ on the ImageNet-1K classification task. This feat is achieved while maintaining linear time and memory complexity relative to the number of patches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HiCoGen, a novel framework for improving the fidelity and compositional accuracy of image generation from complex textual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models excel with simple prompts but fail with complex ones, leading to issues like concept omission and poor compositionality. This paper aims to resolve these shortcomings.

Method: HiCoGen uses a Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm to iteratively synthesize minimal semantic units of a prompt. It employs a reinforcement learning framework with a Decaying Stochasticity Schedule and hierarchical reward mechanism for optimal image generation.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves concept coverage and compositional accuracy, as validated by experiments and the introduction of the HiCoPrompt benchmark.

Conclusion: HiCoGen offers a robust solution for generating high-quality, compositionally accurate images from complex prompts through novel paradigms and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capability in generating high-quality images for simple prompts. However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration. Our RL algorithm is then guided by a hierarchical reward mechanism that jointly evaluates the image at the global, subject, and relationship levels. We also construct HiCoPrompt, a new text-to-image benchmark with hierarchical prompts for rigorous evaluation. Experiments show our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both concept coverage and compositional accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust disentanglement of dynamic objects from static backgrounds in 4D scene reconstruction, particularly as existing methods rely on external priors, fine-tuning, or heavy optimization, and struggle with moving objects.

Method: The authors extend VGGT by mining global dynamic cues using gram similarity and amplifying them across a temporal window, refining masks using projection gradient strategies, and integrating these masks into VGGT's early-stage inference.

Result: VGGT4D achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction across six datasets, and supports single-pass inference on lengthy sequences.

Conclusion: VGGT4D demonstrates success in mitigating motion interference and achieves efficient and precise 4D scene reconstruction without training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 4D scenes is challenging, as it requires robust disentanglement of dynamic objects from the static background. While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction. It also supports single-pass inference on sequences longer than 500 frames.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms of how RLVR affects reasoning capabilities in Large Multimodal Models and finding an efficient way to improve these capabilities without extensive post-training.

Method: The study explores input activation changes caused by RLVR using the perspective of the logit lens and conducts experiments to analyze their relation to reasoning. They propose a method called Activation Replay to enhance low-entropy activations in base models, improving reasoning in post-trained LMMs at test time.

Result: Activation Replay improves reasoning performance across tasks such as mathematics, visual agents, and video reasoning. It boosts metrics like Pass@K and addresses narrower reasoning coverage of RLVR.

Conclusion: Modulating low-entropy activations can enhance reasoning in LMMs. Activation Replay is an effective and efficient technique to achieve this, outperforming alternative approaches. Its benefits are demonstrated in diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach to incentivizing reasoning capability in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), while the underlying mechanisms behind this post-training paradigm are poorly understood. We begin by exploring how input activations are affected by RLVR through the perspective of logit lens. Our systematic investigations across multiple post-trained LMMs suggest that RLVR shifts low-entropy activations unexpectedly, while high-entropy ones are less affected. We further demonstrate that such phenomena are associated with LMM reasoning by controlled experiments, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of modulating low-entropy activations. To this end, we propose Activation Replay, a novel simple yet effective training-free approach that boosts multimodal reasoning of post-trained LMMs without requiring expensive policy optimization. Our design involves manipulation of visual tokens at test time, replaying low-entropy activations from the input context of base LMMs to regulating the RLVR counterparts. Activation Replay triggers better reasoning across diverse scenarios, including mathematics, o3-like visual agents, and video reasoning. We further show that Activation Replay boosts Pass@K and mitigates narrower reasoning coverage of RLVR. Our design is compared against alternative choices, such as replaying high-entropy activations instead of low-entropy ones, or direct cross-model intervention instead of manipulating input tokens, demonstrating the superiority of our implementation. Codes will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning-based model (EmoFeedback2) for continuous emotional image generation with improved emotional continuity and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to emotional image generation fail to incorporate sufficient emotional feedback from generated images and lack adaptive alignment between emotions and textual/image content.

Method: The EmoFeedback2 paradigm uses a fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to evaluate generated images for emotional continuity and provide textual feedback. It includes an emotion-aware reward system for reinforcement tuning and an iterative self-promotion textual feedback mechanism to refine prompts.

Result: Experiments show that EmoFeedback2 generates high-quality images with desired continuous emotions and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a customized dataset.

Conclusion: EmoFeedback2 enhances the emotional continuity and fidelity of generated images by leveraging a reinforcement learning process guided by a vision-language model. The study addresses key deficiencies of prior methods.

Abstract: Continuous emotional image generation (C-EICG) is emerging rapidly due to its ability to produce images aligned with both user descriptions and continuous emotional values. However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset. The code and dataset will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free inpainting method for text-to-image models using optimized initial seed noise and achieves superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guidance-based methods for inpainting often require specialized models due to their limited effectiveness, necessitating exploration of general training-free approaches.

Method: The method optimizes the initial seed noise to align with unmasked data parts, followed by conventional inpainting techniques integrated with linear approximation and spectral optimization.

Result: The proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of training-free inpainting methods, outperforming existing methods in multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Optimizing initial seed noise coupled with novel implementation strategies enables effective training-free inpainting, providing an alternative to specialized models.

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free method for inpainting with off-the-shelf text-to-image models. While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art. Project page: https://ubc-vision.github.io/sonic/

### [164] [GazeProphetV2: Head-Movement-Based Gaze Prediction Enabling Efficient Foveated Rendering on Mobile VR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19988)
*Farhaan Ebadulla,Chiraag Mudlpaur,Shreya Chaurasia,Gaurav BV*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal approach to gaze prediction in virtual reality (VR) using gaze patterns, head movement, and visual scene data, achieving high accuracy and cross-scene generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving gaze behavior prediction in virtual reality environments holds potential for optimizing rendering and interface design while reducing dependence on costly eye-tracking hardware.

Method: The paper employs a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention to combine temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information for predictive modeling.

Result: The approach achieves a 93.1% validation accuracy across multiple VR scenes, showcases temporal consistency in gaze trajectory predictions, and outperforms single-modality methods.

Conclusion: The multimodal gaze prediction method enhances understanding of attention in VR, aiding rendering optimization and interaction design while promoting efficient systems.

Abstract: Predicting gaze behavior in virtual reality environments remains a significant challenge with implications for rendering optimization and interface design. This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames. Cross-scene generalization testing shows consistent performance with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories. These findings contribute to understanding attention mechanisms in virtual environments while suggesting potential applications in rendering optimization, interaction design, and user experience evaluation. The approach represents a step toward more efficient virtual reality systems that can anticipate user attention patterns without requiring expensive eye tracking hardware.

*Yaoli Liu,Ziheng Ouyang,Shengtao Lou,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to refine generated images, ensuring fine-grained detail preservation and pixel-level consistency using diffusion models and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle to preserve fine-grained details and introduce inconsistencies due to limitations in latent compression and post-editing methods.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage process: fine-tuning a single-image diffusion editor for global refinement and employing reinforcement learning for localized detail optimization.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior pixel-level coherence, accurate alignment with references, and surpasses existing models in detail preservation and consistency.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reference-driven image generation by addressing shortcomings in current techniques, improving visual fidelity and usability in practical applications.

Abstract: Reference-guided image generation has progressed rapidly, yet current diffusion models still struggle to preserve fine-grained visual details when refining a generated image using a reference. This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ourMthd{} significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks.

*Jiyeon Han,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang,Haedong Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CREward, the first type-specific creativity reward model focused on creativity in geometry, material, and texture for creative image evaluation and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing creativity as a singular concept is inadequate. A more nuanced approach is needed, especially in creative domains involving images, to better reflect human perception.

Method: The authors conducted human benchmark evaluations and analyzed alignment between human judgments and large vision-language models (LVLMs). They then used LVLM-generated labels to train their creativity-specific reward model, CREward.

Result: CREward outperformed in tasks like creativity assessment. Applications include explainable creativity and aiding both human design and creative image generation.

Conclusion: CREward provides a robust framework for evaluating, explaining, and inspiring creativity in images across key creative dimensions.

Abstract: Creativity is a complex phenomenon. When it comes to representing and assessing creativity, treating it as a single undifferentiated quantity would appear naive and underwhelming. In this work, we learn the \emph{first type-specific creativity reward model}, coined CREward, which spans three creativity ``axes," geometry, material, and texture, to allow us to view creativity through the lens of the image formation pipeline. To build our reward model, we first conduct a human benchmark evaluation to capture human perception of creativity for each type across various creative images. We then analyze the correlation between human judgments and predictions by large vision-language models (LVLMs), confirming that LVLMs exhibit strong alignment with human perception. Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images. We explore three applications of CREward: creativity assessment, explainable creativity, and creative sample acquisition for both human design inspiration and guiding creative generation through low-rank adaptation.

*Changyue Li,Jiaying Li,Youliang Yuan,Jiaming He,Zhicong Huang,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new threat where a single perturbation can manipulate multiple decisions in models, showcasing vulnerabilities in real-world AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk of cascading errors in sequence-decision models and reveal vulnerabilities that have not been systematically studied.

Method: Developed a Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbation (SAUP) algorithm using normalized space and semantic separation strategy, and introduced a new dataset, RIST, for evaluation.

Result: Achieved a 70% attack success rate in multimodal large language models, demonstrating the impact of adversarial attacks on real-world models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the significant threat posed by semantic-aware adversarial attacks, emphasizing the importance of improving model robustness against such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Conventional adversarial attacks focus on manipulating a single decision of neural networks. However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.
  This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying "non-motorized lane" signs as "motorized lane" and "pedestrian" as "plastic bag".
  To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.

*Yuanzhe Li,Steffen Müller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal fusion network for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by using seven modality features and advanced attention mechanisms, achieving superior results on the JAAD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing pedestrian crossing intention prediction is crucial for improving the safety and effectiveness of autonomous vehicles in urban environments.

Method: The approach uses Transformer-based modules to extract features from visual and motion data, incorporates a depth-guided attention module for spatial feature interaction, and applies modality and temporal attention mechanisms to handle varying importance of modalities and frames.

Result: The proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods, validated through experiments on the JAAD dataset.

Conclusion: The paper presents an effective multimodal network design, highlighting its potential to enhance predictive accuracy for pedestrian behavior in autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban environments. Ideal prediction provides AVs with critical environmental cues, thereby reducing the risk of pedestrian-related collisions. However, the prediction task is challenging due to the diverse nature of pedestrian behavior and its dependence on multiple contextual factors. This paper proposes a multimodal fusion network that leverages seven modality features from both visual and motion branches, aiming to effectively extract and integrate complementary cues across different modalities. Specifically, motion and visual features are extracted from the raw inputs using multiple Transformer-based extraction modules. Depth-guided attention module leverages depth information to guide attention towards salient regions in another modality through comprehensive spatial feature interactions. To account for the varying importance of different modalities and frames, modality attention and temporal attention are designed to selectively emphasize informative modalities and effectively capture temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on the JAAD dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, achieving superior performance compared to the baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance pedestrian safety and reduce traffic accidents by accurately predicting crossing intentions in complex urban environments.

Method: The MFT model uses a progressive fusion strategy integrating intra-context and cross-context attention across four contextual dimensions: pedestrian behavior, environmental, localization, and vehicle motion.

Result: The MFT demonstrates superior performance with accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, validating effectiveness in pedestrian intention prediction.

Conclusion: The model improves prediction capabilities through effective fusion of contextual data, providing a reliable tool for autonomous vehicle safety enhancement.

Abstract: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for autonomous vehicles to improve pedestrian safety and reduce traffic accidents. However, accurate pedestrian intention prediction in urban environments remains challenging due to the multitude of factors affecting pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration. Experimental results validate the superiority of MFT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the network architecture and contribution of different input context.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ACIT, an attention-guided Transformer model for pedestrian crossing intention prediction, achieving high accuracy on JAAD datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurately predicting pedestrian crossing intention, crucial for autonomous vehicle safety, is hindered by challenges in extracting and integrating complementary information from diverse data sources.

Method: The proposed model, ACIT, utilizes six modalities grouped into interaction pairs and employs dual-path attention mechanisms, cross-modal attention, and multi-modal feature fusion, along with Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation.

Result: ACIT achieves superior predictive performance with accuracy rates of 70% on JAADbeh and 89% on JAADall datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ACIT effectively addresses the challenge of cross-modal interaction for pedestrian crossing intention prediction, showcasing strong performance and providing insights from extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian crossing intention is crucial for autonomous vehicles to prevent pedestrian-related collisions. However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step. Furthermore, a Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation module is introduced to capture sequential dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that ACIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 70% and 89% on the JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the contribution of different modules of ACIT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are being applied to autonomous driving, focusing on high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios using multi-view inputs and a new dataset (WaymoQA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of existing MLLMs in handling high-level reasoning in safety-critical driving scenarios, a crucial aspect for safer autonomous driving.

Method: The authors define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a two-stage task, employ multi-view inputs, and introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 annotated driving questions to improve reasoning capabilities.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that current MLLMs struggle in safety-critical situations; however, fine-tuning them with the WaymoQA dataset significantly improves their reasoning ability.

Conclusion: The research establishes WaymoQA as an effective resource for advancing MLLMs to handle complex reasoning in autonomous driving, enhancing their safety and decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong understanding of driving scenes, drawing interest in their application to autonomous driving. However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge. Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs underperform in safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes, but fine-tuning with WaymoQA significantly improves their reasoning ability, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset in developing safer and more reasoning-capable driving agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-MI integrates SAM with OVSS models to address over-segmentation and mask-label combination issues, significantly improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, including SAM's over-segmentation and hard combination between masks and labels.

Method: SAM-MI introduces sparse point prompts, shallow mask aggregation, and decoupled mask injection to improve SAM's integration with OVSS models.

Result: SAM-MI achieves a 16.7% relative improvement in mIoU over Grounded-SAM on the MESS benchmark and offers a 1.6× speedup.

Conclusion: SAM-MI provides an effective framework to enhance open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, addressing key limitations of SAM and improving segmentation performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment and recognize objects universally. Trained on extensive high-quality segmentation data, the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable universal segmentation capabilities, offering valuable support for OVSS. Although previous methods have made progress in leveraging SAM for OVSS, there are still some challenges: (1) SAM's tendency to over-segment and (2) hard combinations between fixed masks and labels. This paper introduces a novel mask-injected framework, SAM-MI, which effectively integrates SAM with OVSS models to address these challenges. Initially, SAM-MI employs a Text-guided Sparse Point Prompter to sample sparse prompts for SAM instead of previous dense grid-like prompts, thus significantly accelerating the mask generation process. The framework then introduces Shallow Mask Aggregation (SMAgg) to merge partial masks to mitigate the SAM's over-segmentation issue. Finally, Decoupled Mask Injection (DMI) incorporates SAM-generated masks for guidance at low-frequency and high-frequency separately, rather than directly combining them with labels. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of SAM-MI. Notably, the proposed method achieves a 16.7% relative improvement in mIoU over Grounded-SAM on the MESS benchmark, along with a 1.6$\times$ speedup. We hope SAM-MI can serve as an alternative methodology to effectively equip the OVSS model with SAM.

*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Chong Feng,Zhixing Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method to enhance visual grounding and reduce hallucinations in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual attention in MLLMs often causes hallucinations due to poor localization capabilities, necessitating a method to leverage visual semantics more effectively during inference.

Method: The authors propose VGA, which constructs precise visual grounding from visual tokens and dynamically guides inference processes. In image captioning, VGA suppresses already described regions, and operates with minimal latency, compatible with efficient attention mechanisms like FlashAttention.

Result: VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance across different MLLMs and hallucination benchmarks, with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: The study confirms that explicit visual guidance significantly enhances the visual understanding of MLLMs, reducing hallucinations effectively.

Abstract: Visual attention serves as the primary mechanism through which MLLMs interpret visual information; however, its limited localization capability often leads to hallucinations. We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance. Further analysis confirms that explicit visual guidance plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image vectorization methods struggle with preserving semantic conciseness and fail in handling complex real-world images effectively.

Method: COVec utilizes the Clair-Obscur principle to decompose images into intrinsic albedo, shade, and light vector layers using semantic-guided initialization and a two-stage optimization process with differentiable rendering.

Result: COVec demonstrates enhanced visual fidelity and significantly improved editability over other existing vectorization methods tested on various datasets.

Conclusion: COVec offers a milestone advancement in image vectorization by combining illumination-aware vectorization and intrinsic image decomposition to achieve better results in real-world image processing.

Abstract: Image vectorization aims to convert raster images into editable, scalable vector representations while preserving visual fidelity. Existing vectorization methods struggle to represent complex real-world images, often producing fragmented shapes at the cost of semantic conciseness. In this paper, we propose COVec, an illumination-aware vectorization framework inspired by the Clair-Obscur principle of light-shade contrast. COVec is the first to introduce intrinsic image decomposition in the vector domain, separating an image into albedo, shade, and light layers in a unified vector representation. A semantic-guided initialization and two-stage optimization refine these layers with differentiable rendering. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that COVec achieves higher visual fidelity and significantly improved editability compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: MFM-Point introduces a novel multi-scale Flow Matching method for efficiently generating high-quality 3D point clouds, outperforming existing point-based and some representation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud generation from point-based methods is computationally efficient but underperforms compared to representation-based methods. The motivation is to close this performance gap while retaining simplicity and low overhead.

Method: MFM-Point employs a multi-scale Flow Matching framework, using a coarse-to-fine generation strategy with a structured downsampling and upsampling process to maintain geometric structure and resolution alignment.

Result: MFM-Point outperforms other point-based approaches and matches or surpasses the performance of some representation-based methods, excelling in multi-category and high-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that MFM-Point achieves state-of-the-art results among point-based methods by improving scalability and quality, marking a significant advancement in point cloud generation.

Abstract: In recent years, point cloud generation has gained significant attention in 3D generative modeling. Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges the best representation-based methods. In particular, MFM-point demonstrates strong results in multi-category and high-resolution generation tasks.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in planetary remote sensing caused by image degradation and the lack of ground-truth data, which hinder supervised blind super-resolution approaches.

Method: The authors propose HACBSR, which uses contrastive kernel sampling to reduce sampling bias, and history-augmented contrastive learning to optimize performance without requiring ground-truth images or kernel priors.

Result: HACBSR achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art unsupervised methods for various upscaling factors in super-resolution, supported by a novel dataset, Ceres-50.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that the HACBSR framework provides an effective and unsupervised solution to blind super-resolution for degraded planetary images, overcoming key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Planetary remote sensing images are affected by diverse and unknown degradations caused by imaging environments and hardware constraints. These factors limit image quality and hinder supervised blind super-resolution due to the lack of ground-truth images. This work presents History-Augmented Contrastive Blind Super-Resolution (HACBSR), an unsupervised framework for blind super-resolution that operates without ground-truth images and external kernel priors. HACBSR comprises two components: (1) a contrastive kernel sampling mechanism with kernel similarity control to mitigate distribution bias from Gaussian sampling, and (2) a history-augmented contrastive learning that uses historical models to generate negative samples to enable less greedy optimization and to induce strong convexity without ground-truth. A convergence analysis of the history-augmented contrastive learning is given in the Appendix. To support evaluation in planetary applications, we introduce Ceres-50, a dataset with diverse geological features simulated degradation patterns. Experiments show that HACBSR achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods across multiple upscaling factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance issues in monocular depth estimation for endoscopic navigation caused by uneven illumination, where existing solutions fail to adapt effectively in low-light settings.

Method: Developed an illumination-reflectance-depth model to decompose images using auxiliary networks and a self-supervised joint-optimizing framework with novel loss functions to address uneven lighting challenges.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated effectiveness through comparisons and an ablation study on two public datasets.

Conclusion: Decoupling illumination successfully mitigates its negative impact on depth estimation, enabling improved self-supervised monocular depth estimation under challenging lighting conditions.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation serves as a key task in the development of endoscopic navigation systems. However, performance degradation persists due to uneven illumination inherent in endoscopic images, particularly in low-intensity regions. Existing low-light enhancement techniques fail to effectively guide the depth network. Furthermore, solutions from other fields, like autonomous driving, require well-lit images, making them unsuitable and increasing data collection burdens. To this end, we present DeLight-Mono - a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework with illumination decoupling. Specifically, endoscopic images are represented by a designed illumination-reflectance-depth model, and are decomposed with auxiliary networks. Moreover, a self-supervised joint-optimizing framework with novel losses leveraging the decoupled components is proposed to mitigate the effects of uneven illumination on depth estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was rigorously verified through extensive comparisons and an ablation study performed on two public datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that significantly improves compression ratios and reconstruction quality for point cloud data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing the compression ratio and reconstruction quality in point cloud data is challenging, as low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently to the results.

Method: FLaTEC introduces frequency-aware compression by decoupling low-frequency structures from high-frequency textures, utilizing latent triplanes to reduce data sparsity, computational costs, and storage. Frequency-disentangling and modulation techniques recover full-spectrum signals.

Result: The method significantly outperforms standard codecs, achieving 78% and 94% BD-rate improvement on SemanticKITTI and Ford datasets, respectively, indicating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: FLaTEC addresses the limitations in current point cloud compression methods by introducing frequency-aware mechanisms and triplane representations, achieving both high efficiency and quality in reconstruction.

Abstract: Point cloud compression methods jointly optimize bitrates and reconstruction distortion. However, balancing compression ratio and reconstruction quality is difficult because low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently at the same resolution. To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points. Our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and outperforms the standard codecs by 78\% and 94\% in BD-rate on both SemanticKITTI and Ford datasets.

*Simon Damm,Jonas Ricker,Henning Petzka,Asja Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRADA introduces a novel method for detecting and attributing images generated by autoregressive (AR) models using probability ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable detection methods for AR-generated images amidst their deceptive realism.

Method: PRADA inspects the ratio between conditional and unconditional probabilities of token sequences in AR-generated images, exploiting unique characteristics for model-specific score-based detection.

Result: Evaluation shows PRADA’s effectiveness in reliably detecting images from eight class-to-image and four text-to-image AR models.

Conclusion: PRADA provides a simple, interpretable, and effective solution for identifying and attributing AR-generated images to their source models.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image synthesis. Leveraging the generation principle of large language models, they allow for efficiently generating deceptively real-looking images, further increasing the need for reliable detection methods. However, to date there is a lack of work specifically targeting the detection of images generated by AR image generators. In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function. Our experimental evaluation shows that PRADA is highly effective against eight class-to-image and four text-to-image models.

### [180] [Learning Procedural-aware Video Representations through State-Grounded Hierarchy Unfolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20073)
*Jinghan Zhao,Yifei Huang,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, enhancing video representation learning by grounding procedural semantics in visually observable states, improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning high-level abstract task and step descriptions with concrete visual details for procedural video understanding.

Method: They propose the Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, which incorporates 'states' as visually-grounded semantic layers, and utilize a progressive pre-training strategy to enforce hierarchical structure.

Result: Their approach outperforms existing models on COIN and CrossTask datasets across tasks like task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Introducing state supervision and progressive pretraining boosted performance significantly.

Conclusion: Grounding procedural semantics in observable states and employing progressive pretraining effectively improves procedural video understanding, offering better alignment and task performance.

Abstract: Learning procedural-aware video representations is a key step towards building agents that can reason about and execute complex tasks. Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Ablation studies show that introducing state supervision is a key driver of performance gains across all tasks. Additionally, our progressive pretraining strategy proves more effective than standard joint training, as it better enforces the intended hierarchical structure.

*Chu Chen,Aitor Artola,Yang Liu,Se Weon Park,Raymond H. Chan,Jean-Michel Morel,Kannie W. Y. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the BALD method for improving noise reduction in CEST MRI, addressing complexities like spatially varying noise and heteroscedasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of spatially varying noise and the complex nature of noise in CEST data, which hinder the accurate visualization of low-concentration metabolites in clinical diagnostics.

Method: This paper proposes BALD, a novel denoising method utilizing an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform to equalize noise distributions and a two-stage denoising process with local SVD decomposition.

Result: Experiments show BALD outperformed existing denoisers in metrics like denoising quality and pivotal downstream tasks such as cancer detection and molecular mapping.

Conclusion: BALD successfully mitigates the challenges of noise in CEST MRI and shows promise in improving clinical relevance of quantitative imaging techniques.

Abstract: Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables molecular-level visualization of low-concentration metabolites by leveraging proton exchange dynamics. However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \textit{in vivo} CEST scans. In these experiments, BALD consistently outperformed state-of-the-art CEST denoisers in both denoising metrics and downstream tasks such as molecular concentration maps estimation and cancer detection.

*Arianna Stropeni,Valentina Zaccaria,Francesco Borsatti,Davide Dalle Pezze,Manuel Barusco,Gian Antonio Susto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) domain, achieving comparable performance to traditional methods while enhancing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite many VAD models offering visual explanations by highlighting anomalous image regions, they fall short in providing direct, semantically interpretable insights for users.

Method: The authors propose using CBMs to learn meaningful concepts, creating concept-based datasets, improving CBM architectures to combine concept-based and visual explanations, and developing a pipeline to synthesize artificial anomalies.

Result: CONVAD demonstrates comparable anomaly detection performance to existing VAD methods but excels in providing concept-driven and richer interpretability.

Conclusion: This work enhances the trust and interpretability of VAD systems by bridging visual anomaly detection with human-interpretable, concept-driven explanations.

Abstract: In recent years, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant attention due to its ability to identify anomalous images using only normal images during training. Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WPT introduces an online distillation paradigm for transferring knowledge from a world model to a lightweight student policy to improve planning performance and real-time deployability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing world models involving runtime overhead and offline reward signals, thereby improving optimization and inference efficiency.

Method: WPT uses world-to-policy transfer training through a trainable reward model, policy distillation, and world reward distillation to align trajectories with predicted dynamics and transfer reasoning ability.

Result: WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with notable metrics: 0.11 collision rate (open-loop), 79.23 driving score (closed-loop), and up to 4.9x faster inference.

Conclusion: WPT enhances policy efficiency and accuracy in spatio-temporal environments by leveraging world-model-based knowledge while ensuring safety and deployability.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in world models, which primarily aim to capture the spatio-temporal correlations between an agent's actions and the evolving environment. However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety. Moreover, the student sustains up to 4.9x faster inference, while retaining most of the gains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forest fire detection systems struggle due to the lack of appropriate datasets, often leading to missed detection or delays.

Method: The authors created a synthetic dataset using game simulators (e.g., Red Dead Redemption 2) and real-world images. Detection methods like YOLOv7 and transformers were tested on the dataset.

Result: The paper highlights the effectiveness of using YOLOv7 and transformer models for identifying early visual signs of forest fires in the proposed dataset.

Conclusion: The introduction of a comprehensive dataset and evaluation of advanced detection methods significantly aids early detection of forest fires, enhancing prevention efforts.

Abstract: There have been many recent developments in the use of Deep Learning Neural Networks for fire detection. In this paper, we explore an early warning system for detection of forest fires. Due to the lack of sizeable datasets and models tuned for this task, existing methods suffer from missed detection. In this work, we first propose a dataset for early identification of forest fires through visual analysis. Unlike existing image corpuses that contain images of wide-spread fire, our dataset consists of multiple instances of smoke plumes and fire that indicates the initiation of fire. We obtained this dataset synthetically by utilising game simulators such as Red Dead Redemption 2. We also combined our dataset with already published images to obtain a more comprehensive set. Finally, we compared image classification and localisation methods on the proposed dataset. More specifically we used YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) and different models of detection transformer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage advanced imaging and AI tools, specifically deep learning and attention mechanisms, to enhance the detection and diagnosis of structural cardiovascular abnormalities such as cardiomegaly in X-ray imaging.

Method: The proposed method is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) configuration incorporating the Inception V3 model and a multi-head attention mechanism. Key stages include data collection and preprocessing to ensure high-quality input, followed by feature learning via attention mechanisms which focus on specific regions to improve detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the application of attention mechanisms integrated with CNN for the automatic detection of cardiomegaly with high accuracy and precision, highlighting its potential clinical significance in healthcare imaging.

Abstract: The healthcare industry has been revolutionized significantly by novel imaging technologies, not just in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases but also by the visualization of structural abnormalities like cardiomegaly. This article explains an integrated approach to the use of deep learning tools and attention mechanisms for automatic detection of cardiomegaly using X-ray images. The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision. This will validate that the model can identify cardiomegaly and will also show the clinical significance of this method. The model has accuracy of 95.6, precision of 95.2, recall of 96.2, sensitivity of 95.7, specificity of 96.1 and an Area Under Curve(AUC) of 96.0 and their respective graphs are plotted for visualisation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LungEvaty, a transformer-based framework for long-term lung cancer risk prediction using an entire LDCT scan without pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is enhancing lung cancer risk prediction in population-wide screening programs by addressing challenges in scalability and performance.

Method: The method involves a transformer-based model trained on whole-lung LDCT inputs, using large-scale screening data and optionally incorporating Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG).

Result: LungEvaty achieves state-of-the-art performance, trained on over 90,000 CT scans, with scalability and data efficiency.

Conclusion: LungEvaty provides a robust, open-source solution for scalable lung cancer risk prediction, serving as a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Lung cancer risk estimation is gaining increasing importance as more countries introduce population-wide screening programs using low-dose CT (LDCT). As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets. Existing approaches either over-rely on pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability, or analyze the lung in fragments, weakening performance. We present LungEvaty, a fully transformer-based framework for predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan. The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk. Using only imaging data and no region supervision, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance, refinable by an optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss that encourages anatomically focused attention. In total, LungEvaty was trained on more than 90,000 CT scans, including over 28,000 for fine-tuning and 6,000 for evaluation. The framework offers a simple, data-efficient, and fully open-source solution that provides an extensible foundation for future research in longitudinal and multimodal lung cancer risk prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses video length extrapolation challenges in video diffusion transformers by proposing UltraViCo, a method to control attention dispersion and improve both quality degradation and repetition during extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the challenge of video diffusion transformers struggling to generalize to video lengths beyond their training window, improving both quality and extrapolation capabilities.

Method: The authors propose UltraViCo, a training-free method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window using a constant decay factor to address attention dispersion.

Result: UltraViCo improves video extrapolation limits from 2x to 4x, achieving a 233% boost in Dynamic Degree and a 40.5% increase in Imaging Quality compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: UltraViCo effectively addresses quality degradation and repetition issues in video diffusion transformers, proving useful not only for extrapolation but also for downstream tasks such as video synthesis and editing.

Abstract: Despite advances, video diffusion transformers still struggle to generalize beyond their training length, a challenge we term video length extrapolation. We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation. Furthermore, our method generalizes seamlessly to downstream tasks such as controllable video synthesis and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PETRG-3D, a 3D dual-branch framework for automated PET/CT report generation to tackle the shortage of specialists and enhance clinical reporting. Two new datasets and an evaluation protocol for lymphoma reporting were developed, showing substantial improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing demand for PET/CT imaging in oncology, where the shortage of trained specialists and the complexity of interpreting functional PET scans create a need for automated reporting solutions.

Method: The proposed method, PETRG-3D, is a dual-branch framework that encodes PET and CT volumes separately. It includes style-adaptive prompts to reduce variability in reporting across hospitals. The study developed two datasets (PETRG-Lym and AutoPET-RG-Lym) and introduced a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol (PETRG-Score).

Result: Experiments demonstrated that PETRG-3D outperforms existing methods in both natural language metrics (+31.49% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (+8.18% PET-All), highlighting significant improvements in volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting.

Conclusion: The study establishes a strong foundation for PET/CT-specific automated models by demonstrating the potential of disease-aware reasoning and reliable clinical evaluation techniques, aiming to enhance clinical workflows and diagnostic consistency. Codes, models, and datasets will be released to support further research.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is essential in oncology, yet the rapid expansion of scanners has outpaced the availability of trained specialists, making automated PET/CT report generation (PETRG) increasingly important for reducing clinical workload. Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for future PET/CT-specific models emphasizing disease-aware reasoning and clinically reliable evaluation. Codes, models, and AutoPET-RG-Lym will be released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCFSSNet, a hybrid architecture combining CNNs and Vision Frequency State Space (VFSS) blocks to enhance learned image compression. It achieves competitive results with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in learned image compression, such as balancing local high-frequency details and long-range low-frequency modeling.

Method: HCFSSNet combines CNNs for local detail extraction, VFSS blocks for long-range information, and integrates frequency-aware modules like AFMM and FSTAM.

Result: HCFSSNet demonstrates superior rate distortion performance, reducing BD rates on Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC validation datasets while being parameter-efficient.

Conclusion: HCFSSNet provides a hybrid and interpretable approach for improved image compression with optimized efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has recently benefited from Transformer based and state space model (SSM) based architectures. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local high frequency details, whereas Transformers and SSMs provide strong long range modeling capabilities but may cause structural information loss or ignore frequency characteristics that are crucial for compression. In this work we propose HCFSSNet, a Hybrid Convolution and Frequency State Space Network for LIC. HCFSSNet uses CNNs to extract local high frequency structures and introduces a Vision Frequency State Space (VFSS) block that models long range low frequency information. The VFSS block combines an Omni directional Neighborhood State Space (VONSS) module, which scans features horizontally, vertically and diagonally, with an Adaptive Frequency Modulation Module (AFMM) that applies content adaptive weighting of discrete cosine transform frequency components for more efficient bit allocation. To further reduce redundancy in the entropy model, we integrate AFMM with a Swin Transformer to form a Frequency Swin Transformer Attention Module (FSTAM) for frequency aware side information modeling. Experiments on the Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC Professional Validation datasets show that HCFSSNet achieves competitive rate distortion performance compared with recent SSM based codecs such as MambaIC, while using significantly fewer parameters. On Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC, HCFSSNet reduces BD rate over the VTM anchor by 18.06, 24.56 and 22.44 percent, respectively, providing an efficient and interpretable hybrid architecture for future learned image compression systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow model methods for image restoration encounter challenges like long processing times and over-smoothed results, necessitating improvements in both efficiency and output quality.

Method: The paper introduces Restora-Flow, a method that incorporates a degradation mask to guide flow matching sampling and a trajectory correction mechanism to maintain consistency with degraded inputs.

Result: Restora-Flow demonstrates superior perceptual quality and reduced processing time when tested on natural and medical datasets for image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: Restora-Flow effectively balances high-quality results and short processing times, establishing itself as a robust solution in flow matching-based image restoration.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a promising generative approach that addresses the lengthy sampling times associated with state-of-the-art diffusion models and enables a more flexible trajectory design, while maintaining high-quality image generation. This capability makes it suitable as a generative prior for image restoration tasks. Although current methods leveraging flow models have shown promising results in restoration, some still suffer from long processing times or produce over-smoothed results. To address these challenges, we introduce Restora-Flow, a training-free method that guides flow matching sampling by a degradation mask and incorporates a trajectory correction mechanism to enforce consistency with degraded inputs. We evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets across several image restoration tasks involving a mask-based degradation, i.e., inpainting, super-resolution and denoising. We show superior perceptual quality and processing time compared to diffusion and flow matching-based reference methods.

*Xin Hong,Ying Shi,Yinhao Li,Yen-Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of irregularly sampled imaging data for Alzheimer’s disease progression prediction using a novel manifold-based neural network framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The desire is to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness in modeling disease progression, particularly addressing the irregular intervals in longitudinal Alzheimer’s imaging data.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework combining Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware neural ODE, and Attention-based Riemannian Gated recurrent unit to model disease progression effectively.

Result: The framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, shows strong temporal generalizability, performs well across different datasets, and demonstrates robustness in handling missing and irregular data.

Conclusion: The approach effectively models disease progression, improves predictive accuracy, and exhibits strong generalizability and applicability in diverse clinical scenarios.

Abstract: The uncertainty of clinical examinations frequently leads to irregular observation intervals in longitudinal imaging data, posing challenges for modeling disease progression.Most existing imaging-based disease prediction models operate in Euclidean space, which assumes a flat representation of data and fails to fully capture the intrinsic continuity and nonlinear geometric structure of irregularly sampled longitudinal images. To address the challenge of modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data, we propose a Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware manifold Neural ordinary differential equation, and an Attention-based riemannian Gated recurrent unit (R-TNAG) framework. Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression. Ablation studies verify the contributions of each module, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing predictive accuracy. Moreover, the model exhibits stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, indicating strong temporal generalizability. Cross-dataset validation further confirms its robustness and applicability in diverse clinical settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SKEL-CF, a transformer-based approach for more accurate human pose and shape estimations using the SKEL anatomically realistic model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the biomechanical limitations in traditional parametric 3D human models like SMPL and enhancing the realism with the SKEL model.

Method: SKEL-CF employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework with coarse-to-fine parameter prediction and anatomically consistent training data using the 4DHuman-SKEL dataset.

Result: SKEL-CF demonstrates superior accuracy in human motion analysis, outperforming prior SKEL-based approaches on datasets like MOYO (85.0 MPJPE/51.4 PA-MPJPE).

Conclusion: The SKEL-CF framework successfully bridges computer vision and biomechanics, offering scalability and anatomical fidelity in human motion analysis.

Abstract: Parametric 3D human models such as SMPL have driven significant advances in human pose and shape estimation, yet their simplified kinematics limit biomechanical realism. The recently proposed SKEL model addresses this limitation by re-rigging SMPL with an anatomically accurate skeleton. However, estimating SKEL parameters directly remains challenging due to limited training data, perspective ambiguities, and the inherent complexity of human articulation. We introduce SKEL-CF, a coarse-to-fine framework for SKEL parameter estimation. SKEL-CF employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder predicts coarse camera and SKEL parameters, and the decoder progressively refines them in successive layers. To ensure anatomically consistent supervision, we convert the existing SMPL-based dataset 4DHuman into a SKEL-aligned version, 4DHuman-SKEL, providing high-quality training data for SKEL estimation. In addition, to mitigate depth and scale ambiguities, we explicitly incorporate camera modeling into the SKEL-CF pipeline and demonstrate its importance across diverse viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed design. On the challenging MOYO dataset, SKEL-CF achieves 85.0 MPJPE / 51.4 PA-MPJPE, significantly outperforming the previous SKEL-based state-of-the-art HSMR (104.5 / 79.6). These results establish SKEL-CF as a scalable and anatomically faithful framework for human motion analysis, bridging the gap between computer vision and biomechanics.

### [193] [Harmonious Parameter Adaptation in Continual Visual Instruction Tuning for Safety-Aligned MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20158)
*Ziqi Wang,Chang Che,Qi Wang,Hui Ma,Zenglin Shi,Cees G. M. Snoek,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing safety and task performance in continual visual instruction tuning for safety-aligned multimodal language models, proposing the Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to mitigate risks in real-world multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which require safety alignment during continual adaptation processes.

Method: The study introduces Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), involving parameter partitioning based on focus (safety/task), balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: HPA demonstrates superior performance in maintaining safety levels and mitigating forgetting compared to other baselines on the CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: HPA effectively balances safety and continual learning performance, providing a robust strategy for adapting safety-aligned MLLMs.

Abstract: While continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) has shown promise in adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs), existing studies predominantly focus on models without safety alignment. This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective. In addition, HPA imposes orthogonality constraints on parameter updates to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets demonstrate that HPA better maintains high safety and mitigates forgetting than existing baselines.

TL;DR: ADNet is a large-scale anomaly detection (AD) benchmark with 380 categories and 196,294 images, revealing scalability challenges of current AD methods, and introduces Dinomaly-m for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing anomaly detection benchmarks that cover a narrow range of categories, limiting cross-context generalization and scalability evaluation.

Method: Researchers developed ADNet, a benchmark encompassing 380 categories aggregated from 49 datasets across multiple domains, providing standardized multimodal annotations, and proposed Dinomaly-m as an advanced model for enhanced performance.

Result: Experiments showed existing methods drop from 90.6% I-AUROC to 78.5% in multi-class scalability tests; Dinomaly-m achieved improved performance with 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC.

Conclusion: ADNet provides a comprehensive benchmark to address scalability in anomaly detection across diverse domains and offers a scalable and extensible solution for community use.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify defects using normal-only training data. Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.

Abstract: Eye tracking is fundamental to numerous applications, yet achieving robust, high-frequency tracking with ultra-low power consumption remains challenging for wearable platforms. While event-based vision sensors offer microsecond resolution and sparse data streams, they have lacked fully integrated, low-power processing solutions capable of real-time inference.

Our solution features a novel uncertainty-quantifying spiking neural network with gated temporal decoding, optimized for strict memory and bandwidth constraints, complemented by systematic deployment mechanisms that bridge the reality gap. We validate our system on a new multi-user dataset and demonstrate a wearable prototype with dual neuromorphic devices achieving robust binocular pupil tracking at 100 Hz with an average power consumption below 5 mW per eye. Our work demonstrates that end-to-end neuromorphic computing enables practical, always-on eye tracking for next-generation energy-efficient wearable systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 for generating egocentric videos from exocentric views using a structured framework without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable cross-view video synthesis, particularly generating egocentric views from exocentric observations, which traditional models like WAN 2.2 do not support.

Method: The framework incorporates three modules: (1) EgoExo-Align for aligning exocentric and egocentric latent representations, (2) MultiExoCon for aggregating multi-view exocentric videos into unified conditioning, and (3) PoseInj for injecting camera pose information into the generative process.

Result: Experiments on the ExoEgo4D dataset demonstrate that Exo2EgoSyn significantly improves cross-view video synthesis performance.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable, high-quality cross-view video generation leveraging foundation models, suggesting practical applications and advancements in video synthesis.

Abstract: Foundation video generation models such as WAN 2.2 exhibit strong text- and image-conditioned synthesis abilities but remain constrained to the same-view generation setting. In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch. Experiments on ExoEgo4D validate that Exo2EgoSyn significantly improves Ego2Exo synthesis, paving the way for scalable cross-view video generation with foundation models. Source code and models will be released publicly.

Motivation: Existing models struggle to address challenges in Video TextVQA, such as accurately understanding scene text across frames, integrating temporal and semantic information, and filtering irrelevant cues.

Method: The proposed SFA framework enables adaptive scanning of frames, selective focus on key regions, and amplification of relevant textual cues to guide attention for Video-LLM systems, without requiring training.

Result: SFA achieves state-of-the-art performance and significant improvements over previous methods in multiple public Video TextVQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: SFA demonstrates its effectiveness and generalizability as a robust solution for the Video TextVQA task, presenting a new direction for leveraging Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) task aims to answer questions about videos by leveraging the visual text appearing within the videos. This task poses significant challenges, requiring models to accurately perceive and comprehend scene text that varies in scale, orientation, and clarity across frames, while effectively integrating temporal and semantic context to generate precise answers. Moreover, the model must identify question-relevant textual cues and filter out redundant or irrelevant information to ensure answering is guided by the most relevant and informative cues. To address these challenges, we propose SFA, a training-free framework and the first Video-LLM-based method tailored for Video TextVQA, motivated by the human process of answering questions. By adaptively scanning video frames, selectively focusing on key regions, and directly amplifying them, SFA effectively guides the Video-LLM's attention toward essential cues, enabling it to generate more accurate answers. SFA achieves new state-of-the-art results across several public Video TextVQA datasets and surpasses previous methods by a substantial margin, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GHR-VQA, a human-centric framework using graph-guided hierarchical reasoning for Video QA with improved object-relation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in understanding complex human-object interactions and spatiotemporal reasoning in video question answering.

Method: It represents video frames as scene graphs, links human nodes across frames to form a video-level graph, processes these graphs with GNNs, and integrates them with question features in a hierarchical network.

Result: The method achieves substantial performance improvements, including a 7.3% boost in object-relation reasoning on the AGQA dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances interpretability, emphasizes human-centered interactions, and boosts understanding of spatiotemporal video dynamics.

Abstract: We propose GHR-VQA, Graph-guided Hierarchical Relational Reasoning for Video Question Answering (Video QA), a novel human-centric framework that incorporates scene graphs to capture intricate human-object interactions within video sequences. Unlike traditional pixel-based methods, each frame is represented as a scene graph and human nodes across frames are linked to a global root, forming the video-level graph and enabling cross-frame reasoning centered on human actors. The video-level graphs are then processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), transforming them into rich, context-aware embeddings for efficient processing. Finally, these embeddings are integrated with question features in a hierarchical network operating across different abstraction levels, enhancing both local and global understanding of video content. This explicit human-rooted structure enhances interpretability by decomposing actions into human-object interactions and enables a more profound understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. We validate our approach on the Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA) dataset, achieving significant performance improvements, including a 7.3% improvement in object-relation reasoning over the state of the art.

*Hao Yu,Jiabo Zhan,Zile Wang,Jinglin Wang,Huaisong Zhang,Hongyu Li,Xinrui Chen,Yongxian Wei,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniAlpha, a unified generative framework for RGBA image tasks, outperforming specialized baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGBA image manipulation is fragmented between specialized alpha-focused models and RGB-oriented frameworks, creating a need for a unified approach.

Method: OmniAlpha utilizes MSRoPE-BiL within a Diffusion Transformer architecture, powered by a novel AlphaLayers dataset and trained on 21 tasks.

Result: OmniAlpha achieves a significant reduction in SAD for mask-free matting, strong performance on AIM-500, and high human preference ratings.

Conclusion: OmniAlpha showcases the efficiency and superiority of a shared representation for RGBA image handling, enabling robust layer-aware generative systems.

Abstract: Generative models have excelled in RGB synthesis, but real-world applications require RGBA manipulation. This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion. Our work proves that a unified, multi-task model can learn a superior shared representation for RGBA, paving the way for more powerful, layer-aware generative systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CT-CIG, a method leveraging text guidance and advanced techniques to produce realistic camouflage images while considering logical scene alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the shortcomings of existing camouflage image generation methods that fail to produce natural results due to neglecting logical relationships between objects and their environments.

Method: They propose CT-CIG, which uses a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism to create text prompts from existing datasets and finetunes Stable Diffusion with a lightweight controller to guide object placement. Additionally, they incorporate a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module for better texture learning.

Result: Experiments such as CLIPScore and camouflage effectiveness evaluations show the generated images are semantically aligned and photorealistic.

Conclusion: CT-CIG demonstrates significant improvements in generating realistic and logically plausible camouflage images, addressing prior limitations by leveraging advanced visual language and texture-learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Camouflage Images Generation (CIG) is an emerging research area that focuses on synthesizing images in which objects are harmoniously blended and exhibit high visual consistency with their surroundings. Existing methods perform CIG by either fusing objects into specific backgrounds or outpainting the surroundings via foreground object-guided diffusion. However, they often fail to obtain natural results because they overlook the logical relationship between camouflaged objects and background environments. To address this issue, we propose CT-CIG, a Controllable Text-guided Camouflage Images Generation method that produces realistic and logically plausible camouflage images. Leveraging Large Visual Language Models (VLM), we design a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM) to annotate existing camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts. Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness. Moreover, we design a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module (FIRM) to capture high-frequency texture features, facilitating the learning of complex camouflage patterns. Extensive experiments, including CLIPScore evaluation and camouflage effectiveness assessment, demonstrate the semantic alignment of our generated text prompts and CT-CIG's ability to produce photorealistic camouflage images.

Abstract: The significant molecular and pathological heterogeneity of glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor, complicates diagnosis and patient stratification. While traditional histopathological assessment remains the standard, deep learning offers a promising path toward objective and automated analysis of whole slide images. For the BraTS-Path 2025 Challenge, we developed a method that fine-tunes a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a dedicated classification head on the official training dataset. Our model's performance on the online validation set, evaluated via the Synapse platform, yielded a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.7064 and an F1-score of 0.7676. On the final test set, the model achieved an MCC of 0.6509 and an F1-score of 0.5330, which secured our team second place in the BraTS-Pathology 2025 Challenge. Our results establish a solid baseline for ViT-based histopathological analysis, and future efforts will focus on bridging the performance gap observed on the unseen validation data.

*Sen Nie,Jie Zhang,Jianxin Yan,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces V-Attack, a novel method targeting vulnerabilities in Large Vision-Language Models by manipulating value features (V) for precise local semantic attacks, achieving a significant improvement in success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attacks struggle with controllable and precise semantic manipulation due to semantic entanglement in patch-token representations of image elements.

Method: The study proposes V-Attack, which manipulates value features (V) in transformer attention blocks using two components: a Self-Value Enhancement module to boost V's semantic richness and a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module for targeted adjustments.

Result: V-Attack significantly improves attack accuracy, achieving a 36% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple Large Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: The results reveal critical vulnerabilities in current LVLMs and demonstrate that manipulating disentangled local semantic information via value features (V) enables more precise and effective adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have evolved from simply disrupting predictions on conventional task-specific models to the more complex goal of manipulating image semantics on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning framework for reconstructing medical images from multimode fiber (MMF) speckles with improved fidelity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMF imaging methods struggle with complex real-world datasets and are reliant on large amounts of data. The study aims to overcome these limitations for practical clinical application.

Method: The authors propose a deep learning method, HistoSpeckle-Net, with distribution-aware learning, histogram-based mutual information loss, and multiscale refinements. They develop an optical setup to create clinically relevant MMF speckles linked to OrganAMNIST images.

Result: HistoSpeckle-Net achieves superior structural fidelity and statistical alignment compared to baseline models, performing well even with limited training data and fiber bending conditions.

Conclusion: By successfully reconstructing complex anatomical features under challenging scenarios, HistoSpeckle-Net advances MMF imaging for practical clinical use.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods in multimode fiber (MMF) imaging often focus on simpler datasets, limiting their applicability to complex, real-world imaging tasks. These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions. By effectively reconstructing complex anatomical features with reduced data and under fiber perturbations, HistoSpeckle-Net brings MMF imaging closer to practical deployment in real-world clinical environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage pipeline for estimating 3D motion and spin of a table tennis ball from monocular videos, overcoming limitations of synthetic data models in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with the generalization of synthetic data to noisy real-world detections, and no 3D ground truth trajectories or spin annotations exist for real-world videos.

Method: The pipeline consists of a front-end perception task trained on a new TTHQ dataset for 2D supervision, and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task trained on synthetic data. The backend model is tailored for robustness against real-world artifacts.

Result: A practical and high-performing end-to-end system was developed, capable of robust 3D table tennis ball trajectory and spin extraction in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully tackles challenges in generalizing 3D motion analysis to real-world data, integrating perception and uplifting tasks into a unified, reliable system.

Abstract: Obtaining the precise 3D motion of a table tennis ball from standard monocular videos is a challenging problem, as existing methods trained on synthetic data struggle to generalize to the noisy, imperfect ball and table detections of the real world. This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates. By integrating a ball detector and a table keypoint detector, our approach transforms a proof-of-concept uplifting method into a practical, robust, and high-performing end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis.

*Bo-Kai Ruan,Teng-Fang Hsiao,Ling Lo,Yi-Lun Wu,Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the fidelity-diversity trade-off in text-to-image generation with long prompts and proposes a novel training-free method, PromptMoG, to enhance diversity while retaining semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the fidelity-diversity dilemma in text-to-image models, where long prompts, while encoding rich information, often lead to repetitive and less creative outputs due to reduced diversity.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark, LPD-Bench, for evaluating fidelity and diversity and propose PromptMoG, a training-free method that samples prompt embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians in the embedding space to boost diversity while maintaining semantic alignment.

Result: Experiments using four state-of-the-art text-to-image models reveal that PromptMoG consistently enhances diversity in long-prompt generation without leading to semantic drift.

Conclusion: The study highlights the impact of long prompts on diversity in T2I generation and offers PromptMoG as an effective solution for improving diversity without loss of semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved remarkable visual outcomes through large-scale rectified flow models. However, how these models behave under long prompts remains underexplored. Long prompts encode rich content, spatial, and stylistic information that enhances fidelity but often suppresses diversity, leading to repetitive and less creative outputs. In this work, we systematically study this fidelity-diversity dilemma and reveal that state-of-the-art models exhibit a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases. To enable consistent evaluation, we introduce LPD-Bench, a benchmark designed for assessing both fidelity and diversity in long-prompt generation. Building on our analysis, we develop a theoretical framework that increases sampling entropy through prompt reformulation and propose a training-free method, PromptMoG, which samples prompt embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians in the embedding space to enhance diversity while preserving semantics. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art models, SD3.5-Large, Flux.1-Krea-Dev, CogView4, and Qwen-Image, demonstrate that PromptMoG consistently improves long-prompt generation diversity without semantic drifting.

### [207] [Zoo3D: Zero-Shot 3D Object Detection at Scene Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20253)
*Andrey Lemeshko,Bulat Gabdullin,Nikita Drozdov,Anton Konushin,Danila Rukhovich,Maksim Kolodiazhnyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zoo3D is a novel training-free open-vocabulary method for 3D object detection that constructs 3D bounding boxes and assigns semantic labels using graph clustering and a best-view selection mechanism. It achieves state-of-the-art results in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of closed-set 3D object detection methods that require annotations and cannot generalize to unseen objects while building a framework that operates without training dependency.

Method: The Zoo3D framework utilizes graph clustering of 2D instance masks to construct 3D bounding boxes and introduces an open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus for semantic labeling. It has two modes: zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which is entirely training-free, and self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which uses pseudo labels for refinement.

Result: Zoo3D demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes datasets in open-vocabulary 3D detection. Zoo3D$_0$ surpassed existing self-supervised methods without requiring training.

Conclusion: The research highlights the effectiveness and adaptability of training-free approaches like Zoo3D for real-world 3D object detection, showing potential for broader applications in spatial understanding tasks.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for spatial understanding. Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

TL;DR: The study develops a ResNet18-based pipeline to detect and obtain metadata on camera activation from the DaVinci Xi surgical system’s UI, aiding automated surgical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for precise detection of camera and robotic arm activation states in minimally invasive surgery to enhance data-driven tasks like tool tracking, skill assessment, and camera control automation.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned a ResNet18 convolutional neural network model on manually annotated surgical video data to locate the camera UI tile and detect its activation state. They tested its performance on over 70,000 video frames from three public datasets.

Result: The pipeline delivered nearly perfect detection performance, with F1-scores ranging from 0.993 to 1.000, and accurately identified the active camera tile without false detections.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates a highly reliable and real-time system for extracting camera activation metadata from endoscopic videos, enabling improvements in surgical data management and downstream applications. Public access to related assets ensures replicability and further development.

Abstract: Purpose: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery relies on endoscopic video as the sole intraoperative visual feedback. The DaVinci Xi system overlays a graphical user interface (UI) that indicates the state of each robotic arm, including the activation of the endoscope arm. Detecting this activation provides valuable metadata such as camera movement information, which can support downstream surgical data science tasks including tool tracking, skill assessment, or camera control automation.
  Methods: We developed a lightweight pipeline based on a ResNet18 convolutional neural network to automatically identify the position of the camera tile and its activation state within the DaVinci Xi UI. The model was fine-tuned on manually annotated data from the SurgToolLoc dataset and evaluated across three public datasets comprising over 70,000 frames.
  Results: The model achieved F1-scores between 0.993 and 1.000 for the binary detection of active cameras and correctly localized the camera tile in all cases without false multiple-camera detections.
  Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables reliable, real-time extraction of camera activation metadata from surgical videos, facilitating automated preprocessing and analysis for diverse downstream applications. All code, trained models, and annotations are publicly available.

### [209] [The Image as Its Own Reward: Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Reward for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20256)
*Weijia Mao,Hao Chen,Zhenheng Yang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adv-GRPO, an RL framework for image generation that mitigates reward hacking by using adversarially learned reward models and dense visual signals for improved image quality and style customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of scalar rewards in RL for image generation, which often fail to align with human perception and are susceptible to reward hacking.

Method: Adv-GRPO is proposed with a reward model supervised through reference images as positive samples, avoiding hacking, and using vision foundation models to provide dense visual feedback instead of scalar rewards.

Result: Adv-GRPO achieves consistent improvements in image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics, outperforming prior methods like Flow-GRPO and SD3 in human evaluations.

Conclusion: By employing dense visual rewards and combining visual foundation models with reference images, Adv-GRPO enhances robustness, image quality, and flexibility in style customization for RL-guided image generation.

Abstract: A reliable reward function is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) in image generation. Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization. In human evaluation, our method outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively. Code and models have been released.

### [210] [Modality-Balanced Collaborative Distillation for Multi-Modal Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20258)
*Xiaohan Wang,Zhangtao Cheng,Ting Zhong,Leiting Chen,Fan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MBCD, a framework addressing the challenges of Weight Averaging (WA) in multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) by enhancing modality fusion, reducing bias, and promoting flatter loss surfaces for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WA struggles in MMDG due to differences in optimization speeds among modalities, leading to over-reliance on faster-converging ones and suboptimal modality fusion, which reduces generalization.

Method: MBCD uses adaptive modality dropout to reduce early-stage bias, enforces gradient consistency for smoother optimization, and employs a WA-based teacher for improved cross-modal knowledge distillation.

Result: MBCD shows superior accuracy and robustness on MMDG benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse unseen domains.

Conclusion: MBCD effectively enhances generalization in MMDG by addressing WA's limitations, proving it as a more robust approach to optimizing multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Weight Averaging (WA) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing generalization by promoting convergence to a flat loss landscape, which correlates with stronger out-of-distribution performance. However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions. Extensive experiments on MMDG benchmarks show that MBCD consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

*Omer Belhasin,Shelly Golan,Ran El-Yaniv,Michael Elad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a framework leveraging diffusion for classifying images under challenging conditions, showcasing improved accuracy on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately classifying images under conditions like corrupted inputs or limited training data is challenging, and conventional classifiers may underperform in such circumstances.

Method: The proposed method, DiDiCM, uses a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on input images, supporting both class probabilities and discrete class labels with customizable computation-memory trade-offs.

Result: The method outperforms standard classifiers, achieving higher accuracy with fewer diffusion iterations on challenging tasks, demonstrated on the ImageNet dataset.

Conclusion: DiDiCM proves to be a superior approach for image classification under uncertain conditions, with promising potential and openly available implementation for further research.

Abstract: Image classification is a well-studied task in computer vision, and yet it remains challenging under high-uncertainty conditions, such as when input images are corrupted or training data are limited. Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging. We release our code at https://github.com/omerb01/didicm .

*Amirhossein Khadivi Noghredeh,Abdollah Safari,Fatemeh Ziaeetabar,Firoozeh Haghighi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning framework for anomaly detection in visual inspection, addressing the scarcity of defective samples and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial visual inspection often lacks defective samples needed for effective anomaly detection, leading to challenges in identifying subtle defects.

Method: The framework integrates a neural batch sampler, an autoencoder, and a predictor, using reinforcement learning to select patches and combining loss profiles with segmentation to detect anomalies with limited labeled data.

Result: Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset show improved accuracy, better anomaly localization, and low complexity, with significant improvements in metrics like F1_max and AUC.

Conclusion: The method effectively detects subtle anomalies, leveraging limited labeled data, and outperforms existing techniques while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in industrial visual inspection is challenging due to the scarcity of defective samples. Most existing methods rely on unsupervised reconstruction using only normal data, often resulting in overfitting and poor detection of subtle defects. We propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a neural batch sampler, an autoencoder, and a predictor. The RL-based sampler adaptively selects informative patches by balancing exploration and exploitation through a composite reward. The autoencoder generates loss profiles highlighting abnormal regions, while the predictor performs segmentation in the loss-profile space. This interaction enables the system to effectively learn both normal and defective patterns with limited labeled data. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy and better localization of subtle anomalies than recent state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining low complexity, yielding an average improvement of 0.15 in F1_max and 0.06 in AUC, with a maximum gain of 0.37 in F1_max in the best case.

*Tianxiang Jiang,Sheng Xia,Yicheng Xu,Linquan Wu,Xiangyu Zeng,Limin Wang,Yu Qiao,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VKnowU, a benchmark for evaluating high-level visual knowledge in multimodal language models, alongside VideoKnow+, a model to enhance this capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models are good at recognizing objects but lack human-like understanding of physical and social principles of the world, known as visual knowledge.

Method: The authors developed VKnowU, a benchmark with 1,680 questions across 1,249 videos, evaluating 8 key areas of visual knowledge. They also created VideoKnow+, a model using a See-Think-Answer paradigm and reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward.

Result: VideoKnow+ increased performance by +3.7% on the VKnowU benchmark and showed consistent improvement in other evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating visual knowledge is crucial for advancing multimodal language models towards better reasoning and understanding of physical and social dynamics.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become adept at recognizing objects, they often lack the intuitive, human-like understanding of the world's underlying physical and social principles. This high-level vision-grounded semantics, which we term visual knowledge, forms a bridge between perception and reasoning, yet remains an underexplored area in current MLLMs. To systematically evaluate this capability, we present VKnowU, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 1,680 questions in 1,249 videos, covering 8 core types of visual knowledge spanning both world-centric (e.g., intuitive physics) and human-centric (e.g., subjective intentions). Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs reveals that leading models still fall short of human performance, with particularly notable gaps in the world-centric. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, VKnowQA, and VideoKnow+, a baseline model that explicitly incorporates visual knowledge into MLLMs. VideoKnow+ follows a structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and adopts reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward, achieving a +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on MVBench, Video-MME, and MMVU. Our work highlights visual knowledge as a missing cornerstone for developing more generalizable MLLMs that can not only see but also truly understand our physical and social worlds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenarioCLIP enhances CLIP-type models for multi-object scene representation by leveraging grounded relations and focused regions. Pretrained on a curated dataset, it sets new benchmarks in cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP models mostly address single-object tasks and lack explicit modeling of multi-object relations and compositional scene understanding. ScenarioCLIP aims to overcome this by focusing on relational and compositional structures within scenes.

Method: ScenarioCLIP integrates input texts, grounded relations, and images with focused regions to model scene relationships. It is pretrained on curated scenario datasets and utilizes both manual and automatic data curation to extend existing datasets for domain-specific benchmarks.

Result: ScenarioCLIP achieves robust zero-shot and finetuning performance across scenario-based cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. Its curated dataset and benchmarks outperformed existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: ScenarioCLIP effectively advances scene representation tasks by introducing comprehensive modeling for inter-object relations and compositional understanding, setting a new standard in cross-modal AI tasks.

Abstract: Until recently, the general corpus of CLIP-type fundamental models has widely explored either the retrieval of short descriptions or the classification of objects in the scene as SINGLE-object image classification task. The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods. ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/scenario-clip/ScenarioCLIP

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DAPointMamba, a novel framework for domain adaptive point cloud completion (DA PCC), leveraging State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient and effective cross-domain adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in domain adaptive point cloud completion, where the goal is narrowing discrepancies between labeled source and unlabeled target domains using methods with global receptive fields and reduced complexity.

Method: The framework, DAPointMamba, introduces three modules for adaptation: Cross-Domain Patch-Level Scanning for local alignment, Cross-Domain Spatial SSM Alignment for spatial consistency, and Cross-Domain Channel SSM Alignment for addressing global semantic gaps.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DAPointMamba achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with reduced computational complexity and inference latency.

Conclusion: DAPointMamba demonstrates the effectiveness and adaptability of SSM-based designs in DA PCC, with promising results and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Domain adaptive point cloud completion (DA PCC) aims to narrow the geometric and semantic discrepancies between the labeled source and unlabeled target domains. Existing methods either suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to using CNNs or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the adaptability of State Space Models (SSMs) in DA PCC and find that directly applying SSMs to DA PCC will encounter several challenges: directly serializing 3D point clouds into 1D sequences often disrupts the spatial topology and local geometric features of the target domain. Besides, the overlook of designs in the learning domain-agnostic representations hinders the adaptation performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, DAPointMamba for DA PCC, that exhibits strong adaptability across domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. It has three novel modules. In particular, Cross-Domain Patch-Level Scanning introduces patch-level geometric correspondences, enabling effective local alignment. Cross-Domain Spatial SSM Alignment further strengthens spatial consistency by modulating patch features based on cross-domain similarity, effectively mitigating fine-grained structural discrepancies. Cross-Domain Channel SSM Alignment actively addresses global semantic gaps by interleaving and aligning feature channels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DAPointMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with less computational complexity and inference latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of transformer-based tracking architectures, such as poor detection and conflicts between detection and association.

Method: SelfMOTR enhances transformer-based tracking by identifying and leveraging the hidden detection potential of MOTR-like models, using self-generated detection priors.

Result: SelfMOTR achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets like DanceTrack, showing improvement over state-of-the-art end-to-end tracking methods.

Conclusion: SelfMOTR provides a practical approach for optimizing tracking models by effectively using self-generated detection priors, highlighting the potential of leveraging hidden capabilities in existing models.

Abstract: Despite progress toward end-to-end tracking with transformer architectures, poor detection performance and the conflict between detection and association in a joint architecture remain critical concerns. Recent approaches aim to mitigate these issues by (i) employing advanced denoising or label assignment strategies, or (ii) incorporating detection priors from external object detectors via distillation or anchor proposal techniques. Inspired by the success of integrating detection priors and by the key insight that MOTR-like models are secretly strong detection models, we introduce SelfMOTR, a novel tracking transformer that relies on self-generated detection priors. Through extensive analysis and ablation studies, we uncover and demonstrate the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models, and present a practical set of tools for leveraging them effectively. On DanceTrack, SelfMOTR achieves strong performance, competing with recent state-of-the-art end-to-end tracking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models do not align well with real-world physical principles despite their visual quality.

Method: The paper uses large language models and vision-language models to iteratively refine prompts and address physical inconsistencies via a multimodal chain-of-thought process. The framework is training-free and plug-and-play.

Result: The method improves the Physics-IQ score on the PhyIQ benchmark from 56.31 to 62.38, achieving better physics-consistent video generation.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel approach to integrating physics awareness into video generation and serves as a foundation for further exploration in this area.

Abstract: Recent progress in video generation has led to impressive visual quality, yet current models still struggle to produce results that align with real-world physical principles. To this end, we propose an iterative self-refinement framework that leverages large language models and vision-language models to provide physics-aware guidance for video generation. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal chain-of-thought (MM-CoT) process that refines prompts based on feedback from physical inconsistencies, progressively enhancing generation quality. This method is training-free and plug-and-play, making it readily applicable to a wide range of video generation models. Experiments on the PhyIQ benchmark show that our method improves the Physics-IQ score from 56.31 to 62.38. We hope this work serves as a preliminary exploration of physics-consistent video generation and may offer insights for future research.

*Chao Wang,Chengan Che,Xinyue Chen,Sophia Tsoka,Luis C. Garcia-Peraza-Herrera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Back To The Feature (BTTF), a method for generating counterfactual explanations for video classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective methods for generating counterfactual explanations for video classifiers with requirements for physical plausibility, temporal coherence, and smooth motion trajectories.

Method: BTTF proposes an optimization-based framework introducing a latent noise retrieval conditioned on the first video frame and a two-stage optimization for generating counterfactual videos resembling the input while being guided by the target classifier.

Result: Experiments on various video datasets demonstrate that BTTF produces valid, realistic, and visually similar counterfactual videos offering insight into classifier decision-making.

Conclusion: BTTF successfully enables faithful counterfactual video generation, overcoming limitations of image-based methods and providing meaningful explanations for video classifier predictions.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are minimal and semantically meaningful modifications of the input of a model that alter the model predictions. They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism.

*Baoshun Shi,Ke Jiang,Qiusheng Lian,Xinran Yu,Huazhu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in sparse-view CT (SVCT) reconstruction by introducing LipNet, a provable Lipschitz-constrained network, and the PromptCT framework, enabling efficient and high-quality multiple SVCT configurations within a single model with reduced storage costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SVCT methods face challenges in proving Lipschitz constraints for prior networks and the high storage costs for multiple configuration models, hindering clinical applications.

Method: The authors propose LipNet, a provably Lipschitz-constrained network, integrated with an explicit prompt module, and embed it into the deep unfolding framework PromptCT for treating multiple SVCT configurations.

Result: PromptCT demonstrates superior reconstruction quality and efficiency across various SVCT configurations in real and simulated data experiments, with reduced storage requirements.

Conclusion: LipNet ensures provable Lipschitz continuity, and PromptCT successfully achieves efficient, high-quality SVCT reconstruction for diverse configurations using a single model, overcoming prior limitations.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep learning-based sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction algorithms, these methods still encounter two primary limitations: (i) It is challenging to explicitly prove that the prior networks of deep unfolding algorithms satisfy Lipschitz constraints due to their empirically designed nature. (ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms.

TL;DR: CrossEarth-Gate introduces a toolbox of modules and a Fisher-guided selection mechanism to address domain gaps in remote sensing (RS) data, achieving state-of-the-art results in semantic segmentation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT struggles to handle the multifaceted domain gaps in RS data, such as spatial, semantic, and frequency shifts.

Method: CrossEarth-Gate establishes a module toolbox addressing spatial, semantic, and frequency gaps and uses Fisher Information for adaptive module selection to guide gradient flow effectively.

Result: CrossEarth-Gate demonstrates superior performance across 16 cross-domain RS semantic segmentation benchmarks, showing its efficacy and generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables adaptive fine-tuning for large-scale RS tasks and will contribute further upon code release.

Abstract: In Remote Sensing (RS), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key approach to activate the generalizable representation ability of foundation models for downstream tasks. However, existing specialized PEFT methods often fail when applied to large-scale Earth observation tasks, as they are unable to fully handle the multifaceted and unpredictable domain gaps (\eg, spatial, semantic, and frequency shifts) inherent in RS data. To overcome this, we propose CrossEarth-Gate, which introduces two primary contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules. Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow. It dynamically activates only the most critical modules at the appropriate layers, guiding the gradient flow to maximize adaptation effectiveness and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy and generalizability of our method, where CrossEarth-Gate achieves state-of-the-art performance across 16 cross-domain benchmarks for RS semantic segmentation.

*Han Guo,Chenyang Liu,Haotian Zhang,Bowen Chen,Zhengxia Zou,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TaCo, a neural network enhancing remote sensing change detection by enforcing spatio-temporal semantic consistency via textual semantics and feature reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior methods lack effective temporal semantic constraints, leading to unresolved semantic inconsistencies despite producing spatially coherent predictions.

Method: TaCo enriches mask supervision with a novel Text-guided Transition Generator and spatio-temporal semantic joint constraints for improved feature alignment and discrimination of changes.

Result: TaCo achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across six public datasets for both binary and semantic change detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances change detection accuracy with consistent spatio-temporal semantics without adding computational overhead during inference.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes across bi-temporal satellite images. Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes. This design can yield substantial performance gains without introducing any additional computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments on six public datasets, spanning both binary and semantic change detection tasks, demonstrate that TaCo consistently achieves SOTA performance.

*Shengqian Li,Ming Gao,Yi Liu,Zuzeng Lin,Feng Wang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TReFT, a new method that adapts Rectified Flow (RF) models for real-time, one-step image-to-image translation by addressing convergence issues in adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RF models, though effective for image and video synthesis, are computationally intensive for multi-step image translation. CycleGAN-Turbo offers a pathway for one-step translation but fails when directly applied to RF models, necessitating a novel solution.

Method: TReFT directly utilizes the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models like DiT or UNet for one-step inference. It incorporates cycle-consistency and identity losses for efficient training and introduces lightweight architecture modifications for faster inference.

Result: TReFT finetunes existing large RF models to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple image translation datasets while enabling faster, real-time inference.

Conclusion: TReFT successfully addresses the limitations of RF models, providing an efficient, scalable solution for one-step image translation with competitive performance and real-time applicability.

Abstract: Rectified Flow (RF) models have advanced high-quality image and video synthesis via optimal transport theory. However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference. Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to sota methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference.

*Xuelin Qian,Jiaming Lu,Zixuan Wang,Wenxuan Wang,Zhongling Huang,Dingwen Zhang,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework for infrared small target detection (IRSTD) that dynamically adapts to diverse infrared image scenarios, improving detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IRSTD approaches struggle with challenges like low signal-to-noise ratios, complex backgrounds, and limited robustness across diverse scenarios.

Method: IrisNet employs an image-to-decoder transformer that maps infrared image features to structured decoder parameters, preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enhancing decoding via self and cross-attention, with added integration of high-frequency components.

Result: Experiments on three datasets (NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1K) show IrisNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: IrisNet effectively enhances robustness and detection performance for IRSTD by dynamically adapting decoding strategies to input infrared image characteristics.

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratios, complex backgrounds, and the absence of discernible target features. While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer. More concretely, we represent the parameterized decoder as a structured 2D tensor preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enable the transformer to model inter-layer dependencies through self-attention while generating adaptive decoding patterns via cross-attention. To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information. Experiments on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of our IrisNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety challenges and improve handling of long-tail events in reinforcement learning for autonomous driving by addressing optimistic bias in world models.

Method: Developed an Impartial World Model trained via Counterfactual Synthesis to simulate plausible accidents and integrated it as an internal critic within a closed-loop RL framework for policy refinement.

Result: The proposed model outperforms baselines in predicting failures and reduces safety violations in challenging simulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Teaching autonomous systems to accurately foresee dangers is crucial for developing safe and intelligent agents, as demonstrated by the improved safety outcomes in this study.

Abstract: End-to-end models for autonomous driving hold the promise of learning complex behaviors directly from sensor data, but face critical challenges in safety and handling long-tail events. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a unified model for efficient 3D reconstruction and vision tasks using a compact volumetric representation, addressing the need for spatial compactness and versatility across tasks.

Method: The method employs a sparse volumetric scene representation as the backend of a feed-forward network, enabling efficient multi-view reconstruction without task-specific fine-tuning or optimization during testing.

Result: AMB3R sets state-of-the-art benchmarks for camera pose, depth, metric-scale estimation, and 3D reconstruction, outperforming SLAM and SfM methods.

Conclusion: This flexible model demonstrates that leveraging compact volumetric representations can generalize across tasks, achieving exceptional performance without domain-specific fine-tuning or additional optimizations.

Abstract: We present AMB3R, a multi-view feed-forward model for dense 3D reconstruction on a metric-scale that addresses diverse 3D vision tasks. The key idea is to leverage a sparse, yet compact, volumetric scene representation as our backend, enabling geometric reasoning with spatial compactness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a humanoid visual search framework using 360-degree panoramic images for object and path search, highlighting the challenges of integrating embodied agents into complex, real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of existing static visual search methods by introducing a framework for more human-like, embodied visual search in 3D environments using panoramic images.

Method: It proposes 'humanoid visual search,' where agents perform active head movements to find objects or paths in challenging real-world scenes, and introduces H* Bench as a benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Proprietary models show poor performance (~30% success) under the benchmark. Enhancements to an open-source model improve success rates significantly, but path search performance remains low, revealing challenges in spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved spatial reasoning and advanced techniques for developing embodied agents, providing a research roadmap to integrate such technology into human environments.

Abstract: Humans rely on the synergistic control of head (cephalomotor) and eye (oculomotor) to efficiently search for visual information in 360°. However, prior approaches to visual search are limited to a static image, neglecting the physical embodiment and its interaction with the 3D world. How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360° panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%). Notably, the lower ceiling of path search reveals its inherent difficulty, which we attribute to the demand for sophisticated spatial commonsense. Our results not only show a promising path forward but also quantify the immense challenge that remains in building MLLM agents that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday human life.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the increasing concerns over malicious manipulation in 3D Gaussian Splatting models, emphasizing the importance of tampering localization in preventing misuse.

Method: The method integrates a 3D tampering attribute into Gaussian parameters and employs a 3D contrastive mechanism to identify tampering. Additionally, a cyclic optimization strategy refines the tampering attribute without relying on expensive 3D labels.

Result: Experimental results indicate that GS-Checker effectively identifies tampered regions in 3DGS models, showcasing strong performance without the need for costly 3D supervision.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that GS-Checker is a promising solution for tampering localization in 3DGS models, offering precision and cost efficiency to combat malicious content manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in editing technologies for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made it simple to manipulate 3D scenes. However, these technologies raise concerns about potential malicious manipulation of 3D content. To avoid such malicious applications, localizing tampered regions becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose GS-Checker, a novel method for locating tampered areas in 3DGS models. Our approach integrates a 3D tampering attribute into the 3D Gaussian parameters to indicate whether the Gaussian has been tampered. Additionally, we design a 3D contrastive mechanism by comparing the similarity of key attributes between 3D Gaussians to seek tampering cues at 3D level. Furthermore, we introduce a cyclic optimization strategy to refine the 3D tampering attribute, enabling more accurate tampering localization. Notably, our approach does not require expensive 3D labels for supervision. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to locate the tampered 3DGS area.

TL;DR: BoxPromptIML addresses the trade-off between extensive annotation and fine localization accuracy by combining coarse region annotations, lightweight models, and an innovative dual-guidance feature fusion strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image manipulation localization methods struggle to balance reduced annotation costs with delivering fine-grained localization accuracy, limiting scalability and real-world application.

Method: BoxPromptIML introduces coarse region annotations and uses a lightweight student model, enhanced through knowledge distillation from the Segment Anything Model. It also features a dual-guidance module that dynamically integrates prototypical memory with real-time observation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that BoxPromptIML achieves superior or comparable performance to fully-supervised methods in localization accuracy with reduced annotation costs and strong generalization.

Conclusion: BoxPromptIML successfully advances weakly-supervised approaches in IML by achieving a balance between efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and accurate localization.

Abstract: Image manipulation localization (IML) faces a fundamental trade-off between minimizing annotation cost and achieving fine-grained localization accuracy. Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that BoxPromptIML outperforms or rivals fully-supervised models, while maintaining strong generalization, low annotation cost, and efficient deployment characteristics.

Motivation: To address the limitations of manual efforts, lack of generalization, and limited expressiveness in existing methods for facial geometry reconstruction in digital avatar creation pipelines.

Method: The method leverages VGGT for its generalization ability and expressive power and augments it with Pixel3DMM for topology information. It also proposes a Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy with Laplacian energy.

Result: VGGTFace achieves state-of-the-art results, reconstructs high-quality meshes in 10 seconds using a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, and generalizes impressively to in-the-wild data.

Conclusion: VGGTFace successfully overcomes key limitations of existing methods while maintaining scalability and efficiency, marking an advancement in automated avatar geometry reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing topologically consistent facial geometry is crucial for the digital avatar creation pipelines. Existing methods either require tedious manual efforts, lack generalization to in-the-wild data, or are constrained by the limited expressiveness of 3D Morphable Models. To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, \emph{i.e.} VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective. Our method achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and impressive generalization to in-the-wild data. Code is available at https://github.com/grignarder/vggtface.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FREE and FREE (relax) frameworks to accelerate DiTs-based diffusion models without quality loss, achieving up to 2.25× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) provide excellent generation quality but suffer from high inference latency due to long denoising processes.

Method: FREE employs feature-level autoregression for parallel verification and introduces an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy to improve acceptance rates during speculative sampling.

Result: The proposed FREE achieves up to 1.86× speedup, while FREE (relax) further enhances acceleration to 2.25× on ImageNet-$512^2$ with preserved generation quality.

Conclusion: The frameworks overcome the limitations of speculative inference methods for DiTs, effectively reducing inference latency while maintaining high-quality outputs.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art generation quality but require long sequential denoising trajectories, leading to high inference latency. Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their acceleration is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \times$ acceleration, and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes "MultiID," a training-free approach for multi-ID customization, addressing challenges like copy-paste and text controllability by adapting single-ID customization models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-ID customization faces challenges with image quality degradation due to copy-paste issues and poor alignment with text prompts, making it more complex than single-ID customization.

Method: The paper introduces MultiID, which adapts single-ID models with an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism and strategies like local prompts, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention to generate high-quality multi-ID images.

Result: The proposed MultiID method demonstrates superior qualitative and quantitative results compared to training-based methods, effectively solving challenges related to copy-paste and text controllability.

Conclusion: MultiID achieves efficient multi-ID customization without training, providing improved image generation quality and alignment with text prompts, surpassing prior methods.

Abstract: Multi-ID customization is an interesting topic in computer vision and attracts considerable attention recently. Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges. Its performance is comparable or even better than the training-based multi-ID customization methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), a novel framework for efficient and simplified timestep distillation in diffusion models, avoiding reliance on external data. It demonstrates improved performance and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliance of current consistency distillation methods on extensive training data and computational resources, which limit scalability and deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: The method uses a self-contained distillation paradigm, extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory without external training data or VAE encoding.

Result: TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores under one-step generation on MJHQ-30k, reduces training time by 40%, and saves GPU memory significantly, all without compromising output quality.

Conclusion: TBCM improves efficiency, simplicity, and performance in timestep distillation for diffusion models, while addressing the distribution gap between training and inference in continuous-time consistency distillation.

Abstract: Timestep distillation is an effective approach for improving the generation efficiency of diffusion models. The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of balancing creative flexibility and structural consistency in generating realistic 3D urban scenes using natural language inputs.

Method: MajutsuCity employs a four-stage pipeline, integrates MajutsuAgent for interactive editing, and leverages a high-quality dataset (MajutsuDataset) with annotated 3D assets. It also develops practical evaluation metrics.

Result: MajutsuCity reduces layout FID significantly compared to other methods while ranking first in AQS and RDR scores, establishing it as state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: MajutsuCity achieves superior geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation, paving the way for further research.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D cities is fundamental to world models, virtual reality, and game development, where an ideal urban scene must satisfy both stylistic diversity, fine-grained, and controllability. However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/MajutsuCity.

### [236] [StableTrack: Stabilizing Multi-Object Tracking on Low-Frequency Detections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20418)
*Matvei Shelukhan,Timur Mamedov,Karina Kvanchiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces StableTrack, addressing multi-object tracking challenges under low-frequency detections using a two-stage matching strategy and novel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance multi-object tracking in low-frequency detection scenarios, which are crucial for applications with limited computing resources.

Method: The authors propose StableTrack, introducing a two-stage matching strategy with a novel Bbox-Based Distance metric and integrate visual tracking into the Kalman filter pipeline.

Result: StableTrack achieves significant performance improvements, with 11.6% HOTA enhancement at 1 Hz on MOT17-val, while maintaining high-quality tracking on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: StableTrack offers a robust solution for tracking under limited computational resources, balancing efficiency with tracking accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, where it is important to correctly detect objects and associate these detections across frames. Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers in the case of low-frequency detections, achieving $\textit{11.6%}$ HOTA improvement at $\textit{1}$ Hz on MOT17-val, while keeping up with the best approaches on the standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections.

### [237] [Block Cascading: Training Free Acceleration of Block-Causal Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20426)
*Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay,Nikhil Pinnaparaju,Rahim Entezari,Jim Scott,Yi-Zhe Song,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Block Cascading significantly improves video generation speed for block-causal models by enabling parallel block operations, achieving ~2x speed-ups without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the severe speed-quality trade-off in block-causal video generation, which forces users to choose between faster or higher-quality outputs.

Method: The authors introduce Block Cascading, a training-free parallelization method that allows multiple video blocks to denoise simultaneously using partially denoised contexts from predecessor blocks.

Result: Using Block Cascading with 5 GPUs achieves approximately 2x acceleration in video generation speeds for models of all scales. Small models increased from 16 to 30 FPS, while large models rose from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. The method also eliminates ~200ms KV-recaching overhead without sacrificing generation quality.

Conclusion: Block Cascading provides a breakthrough in accelerating block-causal video generation while maintaining high output quality, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Block-causal video generation faces a stark speed-quality trade-off: small 1.3B models manage only 16 FPS while large 14B models crawl at 4.5 FPS, forcing users to choose between responsiveness and quality. Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

### [238] [Object-Centric Vision Token Pruning for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20439)
*Guangyuan Li,Rongzhen Zhao,Jinhong Deng,Yanbo Wang,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OC-VTP, a method to prune redundant vision tokens in Vision Language Models (VLMs) for efficiency without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision tokens in VLMs are numerous and information-dispersed, leading to excessive computation. Efficient pruning of these tokens is essential while maintaining accuracy.

Method: OC-VTP involves pre-training a lightweight object-centric token pruner, which can be integrated into existing VLMs without fine-tuning models on any datasets. It ensures representative tokens are retained by minimizing reconstruction errors.

Result: OC-VTP consistently preserves inference accuracy in mainstream VLMs across various pruning ratios and exhibits improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach offers a direct, guaranteed efficiency-optimization mechanism for VLMs, contributing to both computational savings and accuracy preservation in vision token processing.

Abstract: In Vision Language Models (VLMs), vision tokens are quantity-heavy yet information-dispersed compared with language tokens, thus consume too much unnecessary computation. Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy. Our pruning also demonstrates interesting interpretability. Our codes are available at https://github.com/GarryLarry010131/OC-VTP.

*Jeonghyeon Na,Sangwon Baik,Inhee Lee,Junyoung Lee,Hanbyul Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for modeling Human-Human-Object Interactions (HHOIs), presenting a new dataset, synthetic HHOI generation methods, and a generative diffusion-based model for realistic, text-to-HHOI creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable machines to understand and model the complex and contextual interpersonal and object interactions in multi-human environments, which were not sufficiently addressed in prior research.

Method: The authors created a new HHOI dataset and synthesized HHOI data using image generative models. They trained two score-based diffusion models for text-to-HOI and text-to-HHI tasks, which were later combined into a unified generative framework for complete HHOI synthesis.

Result: The proposed method outperforms earlier approaches in generating realistic HHOIs from text descriptions. It also enables multi-human motion generation involving objects, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Conclusion: This research addresses an important gap by introducing an extensive framework for modeling and generating realistic, contextually accurate HHOIs, providing tools for broader applications in multi-human interaction modeling.

Abstract: The way humans interact with each other, including interpersonal distances, spatial configuration, and motion, varies significantly across different situations. To enable machines to understand such complex, context-dependent behaviors, it is essential to model multiple people in relation to the surrounding scene context. In this paper, we present a novel research problem to model the correlations between two people engaged in a shared interaction involving an object. We refer to this formulation as Human-Human-Object Interactions (HHOIs). To overcome the lack of dedicated datasets for HHOIs, we present a newly captured HHOIs dataset and a method to synthesize HHOI data by leveraging image generative models. As an intermediary, we obtain individual human-object interaction (HOIs) and human-human interaction (HHIs) from the HHOIs, and with these data, we train an text-to-HOI and text-to-HHI model using score-based diffusion model. Finally, we present a unified generative framework that integrates the two individual model, capable of synthesizing complete HHOIs in a single advanced sampling process. Our method extends HHOI generation to multi-human settings, enabling interactions involving more than two individuals. Experimental results show that our method generates realistic HHOIs conditioned on textual descriptions, outperforming previous approaches that focus only on single-human HOIs. Furthermore, we introduce multi-human motion generation involving objects as an application of our framework.

*Yunqi Zhou,Chengjie Jiang,Chun Yuan,Jing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZoomSearch is a training-free and efficient pipeline enhancing remote sensing models to process ultra-high-resolution (Ultra-HR) images effectively, achieving state-of-the-art results and higher inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-high-resolution (Ultra-HR) remote sensing imagery poses challenges for current models due to token/memory limits or loss of critical details during resizing.

Method: ZoomSearch employs Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search to hierarchically localize query-relevant areas and Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly for compact and faithful patch reorganizing.

Result: ZoomSearch demonstrated substantial accuracy improvement (26.3% on LRS-VQA, 114.8% on MME-RealWorld-RS) and faster inference speed compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: This approach is effective for Ultra-HR RS-VQA, advancing both accuracy and efficiency in ultra-high-resolution remote sensing models.

Abstract: With advances in satellite constellations, sensor technologies, and imaging pipelines, ultra-high-resolution (Ultra-HR) remote sensing imagery is becoming increasingly widespread. However, current remote sensing foundation models are ill-suited to such inputs: full-image encoding exhausts token and memory budgets, while resize-based preprocessing loses fine-grained and answer-critical details. In this context, guiding the model look where it matters before prediction becomes crucial. Therefore, we present ZoomSearch, a training-free, plug-and-play pipeline that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RS-VQA). ZoomSearch combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search, which performs a hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions, with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly, which reorganizes the selected patches into a compact, layout-faithful canvas. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Ultra-HR RS-VQA benchmarks MME-RealWorld-RS and LRS-VQA, comparing against (i) strong general foundation models, (ii) remote sensing foundation models, (iii) Ultra-HR RS-VQA methods, and (iv) plug-and-play search-based VQA methods. When integrated with LLaVA-ov, ZoomSearch attains state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse tasks, improving the LLaVA-ov baseline by 26.3% on LRS-VQA and 114.8\% on MME-RealWorld-RS. Meanwhile, it achieves much higher inference efficiency, outperforming prior search-based methods by 20%~44% in speed.

*Jiatao Gu,Ying Shen,Tianrong Chen,Laurent Dinh,Yuyang Wang,Miguel Angel Bautista,David Berthelot,Josh Susskind,Shuangfei Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, offering significant advantages over diffusion-based models. It achieves robust visual fidelity and temporal consistency while supporting multiple generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the limitations of current video generation approaches relying on diffusion-based models, the paper revisits normalizing flows to address challenges related to spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost.

Method: The paper introduces STARFlow-V, featuring spatiotemporal latent space design, a global-local architecture, flow-score matching for video consistency, and a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme to enhance sampling efficiency while preserving causality.

Result: STARFlow-V demonstrates strong visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and practical sampling throughput compared to diffusion-based baselines. It also supports diverse generative tasks like text-to-video and video-to-video generation.

Conclusion: Normalizing flows (NFs) are established as a feasible and promising approach for high-quality autoregressive video generation, and STARFlow-V highlights their potential for building advanced world models.

Abstract: Normalizing flows (NFs) are end-to-end likelihood-based generative models for continuous data, and have recently regained attention with encouraging progress on image generation. Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to classify dance styles using pose estimates, employing temporal-spatial descriptors and Fourier Transform features for robust yet lightweight analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve human activity recognition in dance genres, addressing challenges in distinguishing styles with overlapping motion patterns.

Method: The technique uses pose estimates to generate descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis, capturing dynamics like velocity, and incorporates Fast Fourier Transform to analyze rhythmic patterns.

Result: The approach provides a reliable classification of dance styles with minimal computational requirements and eliminates the need for complex models.

Conclusion: Interpretable motion representations are effective for capturing stylistic aspects and achieving robust classification with low computational effort.

Abstract: Dance is an essential component of human culture and serves as a tool for conveying emotions and telling stories. Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain. The proposed approach achieves robust classification of different dance styles with low computational effort, as complex model architectures are not required, and shows that interpretable motion representations can effectively capture stylistic nuances.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Loss (PIL) function to enhance cerebral artery extraction from digital subtraction angiography sequences, improving vascular segmentation by incorporating physics-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional loss functions that ignore geometric and structural consistency of vascular boundaries, leading to fragmented or unstable predictions.

Method: A novel Physics-Informed Loss (PIL) was developed, inspired by material physics' dislocation theory. It enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency through physics-based regularization, integrated into multiple segmentation architectures.

Result: The proposed PIL outperformed traditional loss functions in sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence on public benchmarks (DIAS and DSCA).

Conclusion: Physics-based boundary interactions improve the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging, integrating physical principles into deep learning models effectively.

Abstract: Accurate extraction and segmentation of the cerebral arteries from digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences is essential for developing reliable clinical management models of complex cerebrovascular diseases. Conventional loss functions often rely solely on pixel-wise overlap, overlooking the geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, which can lead to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Physics-Informed Loss} (PIL) that models the interaction between the predicted and ground-truth boundaries as an elastic process inspired by dislocation theory in materials physics. This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging. The implementation of the proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/irfantahir301/Physicsis_loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for an advanced benchmark to accurately assess fine-grained image-text alignment, as existing benchmarks depend on rule-based perturbations or short captions, which are inadequate.

Method: The authors developed AlignBench, a benchmark utilizing annotated image-caption pairs from various models to closely evaluate the performance of visual-language models (VLMs).

Result: Benchmarking decoder-based VLMs revealed that (i) CLIP-based models struggle with compositional reasoning, (ii) existing detectors over-score initial sentences, and (iii) models show bias towards their own outputs.

Conclusion: AlignBench serves as an effective tool to uncover limitations in current VLMs for image-text alignment, highlighting areas for refinement.

Abstract: Assessing image-text alignment models such as CLIP is crucial for bridging visual and linguistic representations. Yet existing benchmarks rely on rule-based perturbations or short captions, limiting their ability to measure fine-grained alignment. We introduce AlignBench, a benchmark that provides a new indicator of image-text alignment by evaluating detailed image-caption pairs generated by diverse image-to-text and text-to-image models. Each sentence is annotated for correctness, enabling direct assessment of VLMs as alignment evaluators. Benchmarking a wide range of decoder-based VLMs reveals three key findings: (i) CLIP-based models, even those tailored for compositional reasoning, remain nearly blind; (ii) detectors systematically over-score early sentences; and (iii) they show strong self-preference, favoring their own outputs and harming detection performance.

TL;DR: HBridge introduces an asymmetric architecture for better multimodal generation by selectively bridging intermediate layers, enhancing efficiency and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with modality discrepancies in multimodal fusion, limiting their generation quality and efficiency.

Method: HBridge employs an asymmetric H-shaped design, selectively bridges intermediate layers, decouples shallow and deep layers, and uses semantic reconstruction tokens for visual coherence.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved generation quality, efficiency, and cross-modal performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: HBridge establishes a new paradigm for unified multimodal generation by effectively addressing modality discrepancies.

Abstract: Recent unified models integrate understanding experts (e.g., LLMs) with generative experts (e.g., diffusion models), achieving strong multimodal performance. However, recent advanced methods such as BAGEL and LMFusion follow the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) paradigm, adopting a symmetric design that mirrors one expert to another for convenient initialization and fusion, which remains suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies. In this work, we propose HBridge, an asymmetric H-shaped architecture that enables heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains. Unlike prior dense fusion strategies that straightforwardly connect all layers between experts via shared attention, HBridge selectively bridges intermediate layers, reducing over 40% attention sharing, which improves efficiency and enhances generation quality. Shallow and deep layers, which capture modality-specific representations, are decoupled, while mid-layer bridging promotes semantic alignment. To further strengthen cross-modal coherence, we introduce semantic reconstruction tokens that explicitly guide the generative expert to reconstruct visual semantic tokens of the target image. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of HBridge, establishing a new paradigm for unified multimodal generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mistake Attribution (MATT), a task for analyzing human mistakes in egocentric video by attributing errors to different dimensions. It presents new datasets and a unified model, MisFormer, which surpasses existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic and fine-grained analysis of human mistakes in egocentric videos, addressing the limitations of prior methods lacking precision and granularity.

Method: The authors propose MATT, which pinpoints semantic violations, the Point-of-No-Return (PNR), and spatial mistake locations. They develop MisEngine to generate enriched data and MisFormer, an attention-based model for mistake attribution.

Result: The study introduces two large datasets, EPIC-KITCHENS-M and Ego4D-M, and demonstrates that MisFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple mistake understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and datasets enable more precise mistake analysis in egocentric video, advancing the field and setting new benchmarks for related research tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Mistake Attribution (MATT), a task for fine-grained understanding of human mistakes in egocentric video. Unlike prior mistake understanding work, which lacks fine-grained output, MATT concretely attributes mistakes to the input instruction text or the attempt video. MATT determines what part of the instruction is violated (semantic role), when the deviation becomes irreversible (the Point-of-No-Return, PNR), and where the mistake appears in the PNR frame. We develop MisEngine, a data engine that automatically constructs attribution-rich mistake samples from existing datasets and inherits their annotations. Applied to large egocentric corpora, MisEngine yields EPIC-KITCHENS-M and Ego4D-M, two datasets that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than prior mistake datasets. We then present MisFormer, a unified attention-based model for mistake attribution across semantic (what), temporal (when), and spatial (where) dimensions, trained using MisEngine supervision. Experiments on our new datasets and prior benchmarks show that MisFormer outperforms strong video-language, temporal localization, hand-object interaction, and mistake-detection baselines.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for automated crack detection vital for preserving cultural heritage by utilizing efficient segmentation techniques.

Method: Different U-Net architectures with CNN encoders are evaluated on OmniCrack30k dataset using segmentation metrics, complemented by testing on unseen, real-world cracked statues and monuments.

Result: The models effectively segment cracks and generalize well to unseen contexts despite not being specifically trained on images of cultural heritage objects.

Conclusion: The study highlights the promise of CNN-based U-Net models for fine-grained crack detection, aiding in the conservation efforts for statues and monuments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for automated crack detection in the preservation of cultural heritage through semantic segmentation. We present a comparative study of U-Net architectures, using various convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders, for pixel-level crack identification on statues and monuments. A comparative quantitative evaluation is performed on the test set of the OmniCrack30k dataset [1] using popular segmentation metrics including Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice coefficient, and Jaccard index. This is complemented by an out-of-distribution qualitative evaluation on an unlabeled test set of real-world cracked statues and monuments. Our findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of different CNN- based encoders for fine-grained crack segmentation. We show that the models exhibit promising generalization capabilities to unseen cultural heritage contexts, despite never having been explicitly trained on images of statues or monuments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'New York Smells' dataset, which pairs visual and olfactory signals for deeper multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine olfactory capabilities are limited by the absence of diverse and natural multimodal datasets.

Method: The authors collected 7,000 smell-image pairs from 3,500 objects in various settings and proposed three tasks to train models on this dataset.

Result: Experiments show that combining visuals with olfactory signals enhances representation learning, outperforming traditional frameworks.

Conclusion: Multimodal learning using the presented dataset advances the integration of olfactory data into machine learning applications.

Abstract: While olfaction is central to how animals perceive the world, this rich chemical sensory modality remains largely inaccessible to machines. One key bottleneck is the lack of diverse, multimodal olfactory training data collected in natural settings. We present New York Smells, a large dataset of paired image and olfactory signals captured ``in the wild.'' Our dataset contains 7,000 smell-image pairs from 3,500 distinct objects across indoor and outdoor environments, with approximately 70$\times$ more objects than existing olfactory datasets. Our benchmark has three tasks: cross-modal smell-to-image retrieval, recognizing scenes, objects, and materials from smell alone, and fine-grained discrimination between grass species. Through experiments on our dataset, we find that visual data enables cross-modal olfactory representation learning, and that our learned olfactory representations outperform widely-used hand-crafted features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flash-DMD proposes an optimal framework to speed up diffusion model generation while improving image quality through efficient distillation and stabilized RL fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Models are computationally expensive in their sampling process, and existing acceleration techniques compromise image quality and stability during fine-tuning.

Method: Flash-DMD combines an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy with a joint RL-based refinement mechanism where the distillation process acts as a stabilizer for RL fine-tuning.

Result: Flash-DMD achieves quicker convergence and state-of-the-art generation quality in diffusion models, excelling in realism, human preference, and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: Flash-DMD introduces an effective approach for training stable, high-quality generative models with reduced computational demands and bypasses challenges associated with RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have emerged as a leading class of generative models, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally expensive. Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics. Our work presents an effective paradigm for training efficient, high-fidelity, and stable generative models. Codes are coming soon.

*Haoze Zhang,Tianyu Huang,Zichen Wan,Xiaowei Jin,Hongzhi Zhang,Hui Li,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysChoreo is a novel framework for generating physically controllable and realistic videos from a single image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of existing video generation models which lack explicit physical controllability, plausibility, and struggle with long temporal sequences.

Method: The framework first estimates physical properties of objects in a static image, then employs temporally instructed and editable simulations to synthesize realistic dynamic videos.

Result: PhysChoreo outperforms current methods in generating videos with diverse behaviors, controllability, and physical realism according to multiple metrics.

Conclusion: PhysChoreo effectively combines physically-aware modeling and temporal simulation to achieve superior control and realism in video generation from a single input image.

Abstract: While recent video generation models have achieved significant visual fidelity, they often suffer from the lack of explicit physical controllability and plausibility. To address this, some recent studies attempted to guide the video generation with physics-based rendering. However, these methods face inherent challenges in accurately modeling complex physical properties and effectively control ling the resulting physical behavior over extended temporal sequences. In this work, we introduce PhysChoreo, a novel framework that can generate videos with diverse controllability and physical realism from a single image. Our method consists of two stages: first, it estimates the static initial physical properties of all objects in the image through part-aware physical property reconstruction. Then, through temporally instructed and physically editable simulation, it synthesizes high-quality videos with rich dynamic behaviors and physical realism. Experimental results show that PhysChoreo can generate videos with rich behaviors and physical realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics.

*Shengqiong Wu,Weicai Ye,Yuanxing Zhang,Jiahao Wang,Quande Liu,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Hao Fei,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReaDe improves controllability in video generation by precisely translating ambiguous instructions into actionable formats for video generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limited controllability of video generation models when handling ambiguous and complex user inputs.

Method: ReaDe uses a reason-then-describe approach, training via reasoning-augmented supervision and a multi-dimensional reward assigner for improved parsing and caption generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ReaDe achieves better instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and video quality across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: ReaDe bridges the gap between user intent and controllable video generation, showing generalization to reasoning-intensive and novel inputs.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have significantly improved video fidelity and temporal coherence, however, practical controllability remains limited. Concise, ambiguous, and compositionally complex user inputs contrast with the detailed prompts used in training, yielding an intent-output mismatch. We propose ReaDe, a universal, model-agnostic interpreter that converts raw instructions into precise, actionable specifications for downstream video generators. ReaDe follows a reason-then-describe paradigm: it first analyzes the user request to identify core requirements and resolve ambiguities, then produces detailed guidance that enables faithful, controllable generation. We train ReaDe via a two-stage optimization: (i) reasoning-augmented supervision imparts analytic parsing with stepwise traces and dense captions, and (ii) a multi-dimensional reward assigner enables stable, feedback-driven refinement for natural-style captions. Experiments across single- and multi-condition scenarios show consistent gains in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and downstream video quality, with strong generalization to reasoning-intensive and unseen inputs. ReaDe offers a practical route to aligning controllable video generation with accurately interpreted user intent. Project Page: https://sqwu.top/ReaDe/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DINO-Tok, a visual tokenizer based on DINO, which improves latent space representation and achieves state-of-the-art generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual tokenizers struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity, especially in high-dimensional latent spaces.

Method: DINO-Tok integrates hierarchical representations using shallow features for detail retention and deep features for semantics. It also applies global PCA reweighting to stabilize vector quantization and preserve information.

Result: DINO-Tok demonstrates superior reconstruction performance (28.54 PSNR for autoencoding, 23.98 PSNR for VQ modeling), outperforming previous tokenizers and matching billion-level data-trained models.

Conclusion: DINO-Tok advances visual generative models by leveraging pretrained representations for semantically aligned and high-fidelity latent spaces. Code will be released.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have highlighted the rise of Latent Generative Models (LGMs), which rely on effective visual tokenizers to bridge pixels and semantics. However, existing tokenizers are typically trained from scratch and struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity, particularly in high-dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we introduce DINO-Tok, a DINO-based visual tokenizer that unifies hierarchical representations into an information-complete latent space. By integrating shallow features that retain fine-grained details with deep features encoding global semantics, DINO-Tok effectively bridges pretrained representations and visual generation. We further analyze the challenges of vector quantization (VQ) in this high-dimensional space, where key information is often lost and codebook collapse occurs. We thus propose a global PCA reweighting mechanism to stabilize VQ and preserve essential information across dimensions. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, DINO-Tok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, reaching 28.54 PSNR for autoencoding and 23.98 PSNR for VQ-based modeling, significantly outperforming prior tokenizers and comparable to billion-level data trained models (such as Hunyuan and Wan). These results demonstrate that adapting powerful pretrained vision models like DINO for tokenization enables semantically aligned and high-fidelity latent representations, enabling next-generation visual generative models. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/MKJia/DINO-Tok.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to replicate and improve upon proprietary systems like NanoBanana and GPT-Image by developing an open-source solution for VQ-VA, which generates images in response to visual questions.

Method: A data-centric framework, VQ-VA World, is introduced, involving extensive data collection of 1.8M image-text pairs using a large-scale pipeline. The study also presents the IntelligentBench benchmark for systematic evaluation.

Result: Training with VQ-VA World data significantly enhances model performance on IntelligentBench (e.g., 53.06 for LightFusion), outperforming prior open-source baselines and approaching proprietary systems' performance.

Conclusion: The release of model weights, datasets, and pipelines fosters further open-source research in VQ-VA, facilitating developments comparable to proprietary systems.

Abstract: This paper studies Visual Question-Visual Answering (VQ-VA): generating an image, rather than text, in response to a visual question -- an ability that has recently emerged in proprietary systems such as NanoBanana and GPT-Image. To also bring this capability to open-source models, we introduce VQ-VA World, a data-centric framework built around an agentic pipeline for large-scale, targeted data construction. Leveraging web-scale deployment, this pipeline crawls a massive amount of ~1.8M high-quality, interleaved image-text samples for model training. For evaluation, we further release IntelligentBench, a human-curated benchmark that systematically assesses VQ-VA along the aspects of world knowledge, design knowledge, and reasoning. Training with VQ-VA World data yields strong empirical gains: it helps LightFusion attain 53.06 on IntelligentBench, substantially surpassing the best prior open-source baselines (i.e., 7.78 from vanilla LightFusion; 1.94 from UniWorld-V1), and significantly narrowing the gap toward leading proprietary systems (e.g., 81.67 from NanoBanana; 82.64 from GPT-Image). By releasing the full suite of model weights, datasets, and pipelines, we hope to stimulate future research on VQ-VA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ImageCritic, an approach for resolving inconsistencies in image generation by using a reference-guided post-editing method, resulting in improved fine-grained detail consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of inconsistency in fine-grained details in images generated by current models, which fails in certain scenarios despite available advancements.

Method: The authors simulate inaccuracies by creating a dataset of reference-degraded-target triplets and propose an attention alignment loss and a detail encoder. This enables fine-grained editing and resolving inconsistencies through a reference-guided agent framework.

Result: ImageCritic significantly improves detail-related consistency compared to existing generation approaches across experiments conducted in various customized generation tasks.

Conclusion: ImageCritic successfully addresses the inconsistency problem in image generation with a post-editing approach, offering a robust solution for improving detail consistency across intricate scenarios.

Abstract: Previous works have explored various customized generation tasks given a reference image, but they still face limitations in generating consistent fine-grained details. In this paper, our aim is to solve the inconsistency problem of generated images by applying a reference-guided post-editing approach and present our ImageCritic. We first construct a dataset of reference-degraded-target triplets obtained via VLM-based selection and explicit degradation, which effectively simulates the common inaccuracies or inconsistencies observed in existing generation models. Furthermore, building on a thorough examination of the model's attention mechanisms and intrinsic representations, we accordingly devise an attention alignment loss and a detail encoder to precisely rectify inconsistencies. ImageCritic can be integrated into an agent framework to automatically detect inconsistencies and correct them with multi-round and local editing in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImageCritic can effectively resolve detail-related issues in various customized generation scenarios, providing significant improvements over existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates deep neural networks for predicting human posture during dynamic load-reaching tasks using BLSTM and transformer architectures, introducing a novel cost function to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance human posture prediction during load-reaching tasks leveraging deep neural networks, addressing challenges in motion dynamics during material handling.

Method: Two time-series models (BLSTM and transformer) were trained using a dataset of 3D body coordinates during 25% of tasks, predicting the rest. A novel cost function optimized body segment consistency.

Result: The novel cost function improved prediction accuracy by 8% (arm models) and 21% (leg models). Transformer models showed superior long-term performance with higher accuracy compared to BLSTM models.

Conclusion: Transformer neural networks, combined with body segment optimization, provide an effective approach for predicting human posture in dynamic tasks, facilitating advancements in material handling ergonomics.

Abstract: This study aimed to explore the application of deep neural networks for whole-body human posture prediction during dynamic load-reaching activities. Two time-series models were trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model. This study merits the use of neural networks that capture time series dependencies in 3D motion frames, providing a unique approach for understanding and predict motion dynamics during manual material handling activities.

Result: ShapeGen demonstrates superior performance and successfully integrates high-quality 3D assets into standard pipelines, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ShapeGen establishes itself as a cutting-edge solution in image-to-3D generation, addressing prior challenges and elevating the quality of generated 3D assets.

Abstract: Inspired by generative paradigms in image and video, 3D shape generation has made notable progress, enabling the rapid synthesis of high-fidelity 3D assets from a single image. However, current methods still face challenges, including the lack of intricate details, overly smoothed surfaces, and fragmented thin-shell structures.

In this paper, we present ShapeGen, which achieves high-quality image-to-3D shape generation through 3D representation and supervision improvements, resolution scaling up, and the advantages of linear transformers. These advancements allow the generated assets to be seamlessly integrated into 3D pipelines, facilitating their widespread adoption across various applications. Through extensive experiments, we validate the impact of these improvements on overall performance. Ultimately, thanks to the synergistic effects of these enhancements, ShapeGen achieves a significant leap in image-to-3D generation, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods, MapReduce LoRA and RaTE, for multi-preference alignment in generative models, showing improved performance across several tasks and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing multiple rewards simultaneously in reinforcement learning, which often results in an alignment tax where improving one reward dimension degrades others.

Method: Two methods are introduced: MapReduce LoRA, which trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and merges them iteratively, and RaTE, which learns reward-specific token embeddings for flexible preference control.

Result: Significant performance improvements were observed in Text-to-Image (up to 67.1%), Text-to-Video (up to 90%), and natural language tasks (up to 136.7%), achieving state-of-the-art results in multi-preference alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effectiveness in aligning generative models to human preferences across modalities, overcoming the alignment tax challenge, and setting a new standard for multi-preference alignment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with reward models has advanced alignment of generative models to human aesthetic and perceptual preferences. However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively. On Text-to-Video generation (HunyuanVideo), visual and motion quality improve by 48.1% and 90.0%, respectively. On the language task, Helpful Assistant, with Llama-2 7B, helpful and harmless improve by 43.4% and 136.7%, respectively. Our framework sets a new state-of-the-art multi-preference alignment recipe across modalities.

TL;DR: iMontage is a framework that adapts a video model for diverse image generation and editing tasks by integrating image dataset diversity while retaining motion priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in diversity and dynamics of content generated by video models by injecting the diversity of image data.

Method: Proposed a minimally invasive adaptation strategy, supported by data curation and an innovative training paradigm, to repurpose a video model for image generation.

Result: iMontage effectively handles many-in-many-out image generation and editing tasks with high contextual consistency and extraordinary dynamic scope.

Conclusion: iMontage demonstrates potential as an all-in-one image generator, integrating the benefits of both video and image data systems for superior dynamic and consistent outputs.

Abstract: Pre-trained video models learn powerful priors for generating high-quality, temporally coherent content. While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrained content diversity from image data into this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to video editing by focusing on precise motion control using sparse trajectory edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of video editing by exploring the under-utilized paradigm of precise motion control in generative video models.

Method: The authors extract sparse trajectories from input videos, introduce the concept of 'motion edits,' and use a motion-conditioned video diffusion model fine-tuned on motion counterfactuals.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates powerful video editing capabilities, achieves natural propagating edits, and receives over 65% preference in user studies compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: Directly editing video motion through sparse trajectories enables precise, effective video alterations, advancing the capabilities of generative video editing models.

Abstract: While generative video models have achieved remarkable fidelity and consistency, applying these capabilities to video editing remains a complex challenge. Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a "motion edit" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating "motion counterfactuals", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

TL;DR: CAPNET is a new framework addressing long-tailed multi-label visual recognition using fine-tuned CLIP and optimized learning strategies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of biased models in long-tailed multi-label visual recognition where highly imbalanced class distributions favor head classes at the expense of the tail.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end framework, CAPNET, combining CLIP's textual encoder with a graph convolutional network for label propagation, learnable soft prompts, a distribution-balanced Focal loss, test-time ensembling, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: CAPNET outperforms state-of-the-art methods on VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE benchmarks, proving its efficacy in multi-label recognition tasks.

Conclusion: CAPNET successfully tackles the limitations of previous methods, improving generalization and addressing imbalance in long-tailed multi-label visual tasks.

Abstract: Long-tailed multi-label visual recognition poses a significant challenge, as images typically contain multiple labels with highly imbalanced class distributions, leading to biased models that favor head classes while underperforming on tail classes. Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmarks including VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that CAPNET achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world long-tailed multi-label visual recognition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DataConcept and Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), new methods for task-adaptive online data curation for vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current offline, concept-agnostic data curation methods for vision-language models and improve their adaptability and task-specific performance.

Method: The authors present DataConcept, a 128M web-crawled dataset with fine-grained concept details, and propose CABS for batch sampling, including two variants: Diversity Maximization (CABS-DM) and Frequency Maximization (CABS-FM).

Result: CABS leads to significant performance improvements for vision-language models (like CLIP/SigLIP) and achieves strong results across 28 benchmarks.

Conclusion: CABS provides an effective and open-source solution for task-adaptive, concept-based data curation, enabling flexible model fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks.

Abstract: What data should a vision-language model be trained on? To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions. We propose two variants: (i) Diversity Maximization (CABS-DM) to curate batches with a broad coverage of available concepts, and (ii) Frequency Maximization (CABS-FM) to curate batches with high object multiplicity. Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our CABS method significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP model classes and yields highly performant models. Overall, CABS represents a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online data curation algorithms, enabling practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLM$^2$, a vision-language model designed for better spatial reasoning by integrating 3D-aware representation and a dual-memory module for improved long-horizon reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with spatial reasoning due to challenges in aligning semantic and geometric information and retaining 3D understanding over time.

Method: The proposed VLM$^2$ utilizes a dual-memory module. This consists of a working memory for short-term context and an episodic memory for long-term storage, combined with a 3D-aware representation derived from 2D videos.

Result: VLM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in spatial reasoning across multiple benchmarks, surpassing previous video-only models.

Conclusion: The model successfully addresses the challenges of semantic-geometric misalignment and persistent memory, advancing the capabilities of vision-language systems in spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a critical capability for intelligent robots, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) still fall short of human-level performance in video-based spatial reasoning. This gap mainly stems from two challenges: a semantic-geometric misalignment that prevents consistent 3D understanding, and the absence of persistent memory to retain 3D representation and understanding over time. To address these limitations, we present VLM$^2$, a Vision-Language Model with persistent Memory for spatial reasoning with a view-consistent, 3D-aware representation purely from 2D video. Specifically, to enhance long-horizon reasoning, we incorporate a dual-memory module, consisting of a working memory that operates as a sliding window to focus on immediate context, and an episodic memory that consolidates and stores critical long-term information. This design enables efficient and long-horizon spatial reasoning with a fixed computational cost. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that VLM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance among video-only models, significantly advancing the frontier of visual-spatial intelligence.

Motivation: The motivation is to eliminate the lossy reconstruction and error accumulation of latent-space modeling by creating an end-to-end pixel-space approach, improving joint optimization and detail preservation.

Result: PixelDiT achieved 1.61 FID on ImageNet 256x256 and outperformed existing pixel generative models. In text-to-image generation, it achieved strong metrics of 0.74 on GenEval and 83.5 on DPG-bench.

Conclusion: PixelDiT demonstrates the feasibility of single-stage pixel-space diffusion models, providing both qualitative and quantitative improvements over existing methods, and approaches the top-performing latent diffusion models in effectiveness.

Abstract: Latent-space modeling has been the standard for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). However, it relies on a two-stage pipeline where the pretrained autoencoder introduces lossy reconstruction, leading to error accumulation while hindering joint optimization. To address these issues, we propose PixelDiT, a single-stage, end-to-end model that eliminates the need for the autoencoder and learns the diffusion process directly in the pixel space. PixelDiT adopts a fully transformer-based architecture shaped by a dual-level design: a patch-level DiT that captures global semantics and a pixel-level DiT that refines texture details, enabling efficient training of a pixel-space diffusion model while preserving fine details. Our analysis reveals that effective pixel-level token modeling is essential to the success of pixel diffusion. PixelDiT achieves 1.61 FID on ImageNet 256x256, surpassing existing pixel generative models by a large margin. We further extend PixelDiT to text-to-image generation and pretrain it at the 1024x1024 resolution in pixel space. It achieves 0.74 on GenEval and 83.5 on DPG-bench, approaching the best latent diffusion models.

*Xiaoye Wang,Chen Tang,Xiangyu Yue,Wei-Hong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for multi-task learning by incorporating 3D-aware geometric consistency using a Cross-view Module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of current MTL methods that mainly rely on 2D image space correlations, often lacking 3D awareness, which is crucial for comprehensive scene understanding.

Method: The authors introduce a Cross-view Module (CvM) that integrates geometric consistency through cost volume, enabling cross-view and cross-task feature correlations. This module is lightweight, shared across tasks, and architecture-agnostic.

Result: The proposed method achieves improved performance on NYUv2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing geometric consistency in MTL.

Conclusion: Incorporating 3D-aware geometric consistency into MTL networks can significantly enhance their performance by modeling cross-task correlations better.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of training a single network to jointly perform multiple dense prediction tasks, such as segmentation and depth estimation, i.e., multi-task learning (MTL). Current approaches mainly capture cross-task relations in the 2D image space, often leading to unstructured features lacking 3D-awareness. We argue that 3D-awareness is vital for modeling cross-task correlations essential for comprehensive scene understanding. We propose to address this problem by integrating correlations across views, i.e., cost volume, as geometric consistency in the MTL network. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Cross-view Module (CvM), shared across tasks, to exchange information across views and capture cross-view correlations, integrated with a feature from MTL encoder for multi-task predictions. This module is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to both single and multi-view data. Extensive results on NYUv2 and PASCAL-Context demonstrate that our method effectively injects geometric consistency into existing MTL methods to improve performance.

*Tahira Kazimi,Connor Dunlop,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses the low diversity challenge in text-to-video models by introducing a novel framework, DPP-GRPO, which enhances video diversity while retaining quality and prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of low diversity in generated videos from text-to-video models, enabling a broader range of plausible outputs from single prompts.

Method: The paper introduces DPP-GRPO, combining Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to penalize redundant samples and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for group-based feedback on candidates, ensuring diverse video generation.

Result: The implementation of DPP-GRPO on WAN and CogVideoX improves diversity in outputs (visual appearance, camera motions, scenes) as validated on benchmarks like VBench and through human preference studies.

Conclusion: DPP-GRPO enhances video diversity without compromising perceptual quality or fidelity, and the release of code and a new benchmark dataset supports future research.

Abstract: While recent text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have achieved impressive quality and prompt alignment, they often produce low-diversity outputs when sampling multiple videos from a single text prompt. We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies. Moreover, we release our code and a new benchmark dataset of 30,000 diverse prompts to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LocateAnything3D, a method for 3D detection using vision-language models (VLMs) through next-token prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Omni3D benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLMs excel at 2D tasks but struggle with 3D multi-object detection. The paper aims to address this gap by developing a practical and effective methodology for VLMs to perceive in 3D.

Method: The paper proposes a Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence approach, using next-token prediction to infer 3D attributes such as distance, size, and pose. The method uses a structured curriculum and a VLM-native interface to integrate open-vocabulary capabilities.

Result: LocateAnything3D achieves 49.89 AP_3D on Omni3D, surpassing previous benchmarks by a significant margin, and generalizes well in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The introduced method turns 3D detection into a next-token prediction problem, providing a robust foundation for VLMs to operate effectively in 3D environments with improved accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: To act in the world, a model must name what it sees and know where it is in 3D. Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.

### [268] [Infinity-RoPE: Action-Controllable Infinite Video Generation Emerges From Autoregressive Self-Rollout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20649)
*Hidir Yesiltepe,Tuna Han Salih Meral,Adil Kaan Akan,Kaan Oktay,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces $$-RoPE, a novel framework addressing limitations in autoregressive video diffusion models, enabling infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models face constraints like finite temporal horizons, slow action control, and difficulty achieving cinematic transitions. The paper aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: The framework utilizes three components: Block-Relativistic RoPE for continuous video generation, KV Flush for immediate action control, and RoPE Cut for incorporating controlled discontinuous transitions.

Result: Experiments show that $$-RoPE outperforms existing models in generating high-quality, long-form controllable videos.

Conclusion: $$-RoPE provides a training-free solution for surpassing temporal and cinematic limitations in video diffusion models, establishing a foundation for advanced video generation capabilities.

Abstract: Current autoregressive video diffusion models are constrained by three core bottlenecks: (i) the finite temporal horizon imposed by the base model's 3D Rotary Positional Embedding (3D-RoPE), (ii) slow prompt responsiveness in maintaining fine-grained action control during long-form rollouts, and (iii) the inability to realize discontinuous cinematic transitions within a single generation stream. We introduce $\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.

TL;DR: MedROV introduces a real-time open-vocabulary detection for medical imaging, overcoming dataset limitations and enhancing text-image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional object detection models in medical imaging, specifically their inability to detect novel labels beyond a closed-set paradigm.

Method: MedROV leverages a curated large-scale dataset (Omnis), a pseudo-labeling strategy for handling missing annotations, and incorporates knowledge from a pre-trained foundation model. It uses contrastive learning and cross-modal representations.

Result: MedROV achieves a significant performance improvement, surpassing state-of-the-art models with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50 and closed-set detectors by 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS.

Conclusion: MedROV successfully bridges the gap in open-vocabulary object detection for medical imaging, setting a new benchmark and providing resources for further research.

Abstract: Traditional object detection models in medical imaging operate within a closed-set paradigm, limiting their ability to detect objects of novel labels. Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RubricRL introduces a framework for interpretable and customizable rewards in RL for text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of designing effective and interpretable reward systems in reinforcement learning for text-to-image generative models.

Method: RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt, evaluating fine-grained visual criteria using multimodal judges, coupled with adaptive weighting mechanisms.

Result: RubricRL enhances prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and model generalizability while providing modular supervision signals.

Conclusion: The framework provides an extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures and allows user-adjustable reward mechanisms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning text-to-image generative models with human preferences. A key challenge, however, lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Existing methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g., CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a single scalar reward distilled from human preference models, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We propose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-based reward design that offers greater interpretability, composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt--a decomposable checklist of fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism--tailored to the input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimensions. This design not only produces interpretable and modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g., GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that RubricRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Julia-based framework for efficient computation scheduling using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the inefficiency in handling complex computational problems with diverse hardware requirements, parallelism, and task dependencies.

Method: The authors extend DAG scheduling concepts with theoretical foundations and domain-specific optimizations, and implement an automatic framework in Julia for statically scheduled computation.

Result: A practical implementation of the framework is demonstrated through quantum electrodynamics calculations of matrix elements for scattering processes.

Conclusion: The framework improves computational efficiency by optimizing task scheduling and allows dynamic and automatic generation of compiled code for complex computations.

Abstract: Complex computational problems in science often consist of smaller parts that can have largely distinct compute requirements from one another. For optimal efficiency, analyzing each subtask and scheduling it on the best-suited hardware would be necessary. Other considerations must be taken into account, too, such as parallelism, dependencies between different subtasks, and data transfer speeds between devices. To achieve this, directed acyclic graphs are often employed to represent these problems and enable utilizing as much hardware as possible on a given machine. In this paper, we present a software framework written in Julia capable of automatically and dynamically producing statically scheduled and compiled code. We lay theoretical foundations and add domain-specific information about the computation to the existing concepts of DAG scheduling, enabling optimizations that would otherwise be impossible. To illustrate the theory we implement an example application: the computation of matrix elements for scattering processes with many external particles in quantum electrodynamics.

Motivation: The increase in cloud-based LLM adoption for automation in incident categorization poses challenges such as cost, latency, and confidentiality risks.

Method: Evaluation of 21 locally-executed SLMs ranging from 1B to 20B parameters with varying temperature hyperparameters, measuring precision and execution time on different architectures.

Result: Temperature variation plays a minimal role, while model parameter count and GPU capacity significantly influence performance.

Conclusion: Locally executed SLMs can be an effective solution for incident categorization when sufficient GPU resources are available and large model sizes are leveraged.

Abstract: SOCs and CSIRTs face increasing pressure to automate incident categorization, yet the use of cloud-based LLMs introduces costs, latency, and confidentiality risks. We investigate whether locally executed SLMs can meet this challenge. We evaluated 21 models ranging from 1B to 20B parameters, varying the temperature hyperparameter and measuring execution time and precision across two distinct architectures.

Motivation: To design a more efficient algorithm to improve resolution time while maintaining solution quality for extremely large-scale CVRP instances.

Method: A parallel adaptation of the existing FILO2 algorithm is implemented, leveraging locality and asynchronous optimization using multiple solvers for simultaneous solution refinement.

Result: FILO2$x$ significantly reduces computation time compared to the original single-threaded FILO2 while maintaining solution quality, with scalability from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of customers.

Conclusion: FILO2$x$ demonstrates the potential of parallel computation to enhance Large-scale optimization problems like CVRP, offering speed enhancements without compromising solution quality.

Abstract: We propose a parallel shared-memory schema to cooperatively optimize the solution of a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem instance with minimal synchronization effort and without the need for an explicit decomposition. To this end, we design FILO2$^x$ as a single-trajectory parallel adaptation of the FILO2 algorithm originally proposed for extremely large-scale instances and described in Accorsi and Vigo (2024). Using the locality of the FILO2 optimization applications, in FILO2$^x$ several possibly unrelated solution areas are concurrently asynchronously optimized. The overall search trajectory emerges as an iteration-based parallelism obtained by the simultaneous optimization of the same underlying solution performed by several solvers. Despite the high efficiency exhibited by the single-threaded FILO2 algorithm, the computational results show that, by better exploiting the available computing resources, FILO2$^x$ can greatly enhance the resolution time compared to the original approach, still maintaining a similar final solution quality for instances ranging from hundreds to hundreds of thousands customers.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic shard allocation protocol for scalable blockchains, achieving improved throughput and reduced latency while maintaining security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability challenges in blockchain systems by overcoming workload skew, congestion, and cross-shard communication inefficiencies in static or heuristic shard allocations.

Method: Introduces the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), combining a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a Safe-PPO reinforcement learning controller for workload prediction and dynamic shard reconfiguration.

Result: Achieves up to 2x throughput, 35% lower latency, and 20% reduced cross-shard overhead based on experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: Predictive, deterministic, and security-aware shard allocation improves scalability and efficiency in blockchain systems, making it a promising approach for blockchain advancements.

Abstract: Sharding has emerged as a key technique to address blockchain scalability by partitioning the ledger into multiple shards that process transactions in parallel. Although this approach improves throughput, static or heuristic shard allocation often leads to workload skew, congestion, and excessive cross-shard communication diminishing the scalability benefits of sharding. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), a dynamic and intelligent allocation framework that proactively assigns accounts and transactions to shards based on workload forecasts. PSAP integrates a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning (Safe-PPO) controller, jointly enabling multi-block-ahead prediction and adaptive shard reconfiguration. The protocol enforces deterministic inference across validators through a synchronized quantized runtime and a safety gate that limits stake concentration, migration gas, and utilization thresholds. By anticipating hotspot formation and executing bounded, atomic migrations, PSAP achieves stable load balance while preserving Byzantine safety. Experimental evaluation on heterogeneous datasets, including Ethereum, NEAR, and Hyperledger Fabric mapped via address-clustering heuristics, demonstrates up to 2x throughput improvement, 35\% lower latency, and 20\% reduced cross-shard overhead compared to existing dynamic sharding baselines. These results confirm that predictive, deterministic, and security-aware shard allocation is a promising direction for next-generation scalable blockchain systems.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of integrating robust storage solutions into autonomous vehicle systems to enhance scalability and efficiency, while paving the way for future developments in this domain.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are evolving into mobile computing platforms, equipped with powerful processors and diverse sensors that generate massive heterogeneous data, for example 14 TB per day. Supporting emerging third-party applications calls for a general-purpose, queryable onboard storage system. Yet today's data loggers and storage stacks in vehicles fail to deliver efficient data storage and retrieval. This paper presents AVS, an Autonomous Vehicle Storage system that co-designs computation with a hierarchical layout: modality-aware reduction and compression, hot-cold tiering with daily archival, and a lightweight metadata layer for indexing. The design is grounded with system-level benchmarks on AV data that cover SSD and HDD filesystems and embedded indexing, and is validated on embedded hardware with real L4 autonomous driving traces. The prototype delivers predictable real-time ingest, fast selective retrieval, and substantial footprint reduction under modest resource budgets. The work also outlines observations and next steps toward more scalable and longer deployments to motivate storage as a first-class component in AV stacks.

Motivation: Deploying DNNs on edge devices faces challenges due to high resource demands, existing methods like compression compromise accuracy, and hardware solutions are costly or inflexible.

Method: Introduces SparOA, leveraging operator characteristics with three components: threshold predictor for optimal conditions, reinforcement learning scheduler for dynamic resource allocation, and a hybrid inference engine optimizing execution.

Result: SparOA achieves speedups of 1.22-1.31x over baselines, up to 50.7x over CPU-only setups, and reduces energy consumption by 7%-16% compared to the best co-execution baseline.

Conclusion: Hybrid inference frameworks like SparOA improve both performance and energy efficiency for DNN deployment on edge devices through advanced operator scheduling strategies and resource optimization.

Abstract: The resource demands of deep neural network (DNN) models introduce significant performance challenges, especially when deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing solutions like model compression often sacrifice accuracy, while specialized hardware remains costly and inflexible. Hybrid inference methods, however, typically overlook how operator characteristics impact performance. In this work, we present SparOA, a CPU-GPU hybrid inference framework, which leverages both sparsity and computational intensity to optimize operator scheduling. SparOA embraces aforementioned challenges through three key components: (1) a threshold predictor that accurately determines optimal sparsity and computational intensity thresholds; (2) a reinforcement learning-based scheduler that dynamically optimizes resource allocation based on real-time hardware states; and (3) a hybrid inference engine that enhances efficiency through asynchronous execution and batch size optimization.Extensive results show that SparOA achieves an average speedup of 1.22-1.31x compared to all baselines, and outperforms the CPU-Only by up to 50.7x. Also, SparOA achieves optimal energy-per-inference, consuming 7\%-16\% less energy than the SOTA co-execution baseline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate long-term scalability and energy-efficiency for AI systems powered by renewable solar energy.

Method: Developed a satellite compute system with solar arrays, free-space optical links, Google TPUs, close-proximity formation flight, and radiation-tested hardware.

Result: Demonstrated radiation durability of TPUs for space missions. Highlighted potential launch cost reductions for feasibility by mid-2030s.

Conclusion: AI infrastructure in space powered by solar energy is technically viable with advancements in formation flight technology and decreasing launch costs.

Abstract: If AI is a foundational general-purpose technology, we should anticipate that demand for AI compute -- and energy -- will continue to grow. The Sun is by far the largest energy source in our solar system, and thus it warrants consideration how future AI infrastructure could most efficiently tap into that power. This work explores a scalable compute system for machine learning in space, using fleets of satellites equipped with solar arrays, inter-satellite links using free-space optics, and Google tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator chips. To facilitate high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite communication, the satellites would be flown in close proximity. We illustrate the basic approach to formation flight via a 81-satellite cluster of 1 km radius, and describe an approach for using high-precision ML-based models to control large-scale constellations. Trillium TPUs are radiation tested. They survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures, and are characterized for bit-flip errors. Launch costs are a critical part of overall system cost; a learning curve analysis suggests launch to low-Earth orbit (LEO) may reach $\lesssim$\$200/kg by the mid-2030s.

Abstract: As the demand grows for scalable and privacy-aware AI systems, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution, allowing decentralized model training without moving raw data.

*Aurelio Vivas,Harold Castro*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'nFlows,' a runtime system that incorporates NUMA-awareness in scheduling data-intensive workflows on modern HPC systems with heterogeneous memory architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workflow scheduling on HPC systems is challenging due to NUMA architecture complexities, requiring optimization for data locality within nodes with diverse memory types and accelerators.

Method: The authors developed nFlows, a NUMA-aware runtime system for simulating, executing, and validating scheduling algorithms on HPC systems.

Result: nFlows allows the creation of simulation models, direct execution on physical systems, and facilitates studies related to NUMA effects, algorithm designs, data behavior analysis, and performance bottlenecks in workflow execution.

Conclusion: nFlows provides a robust solution for addressing NUMA-related challenges, advancing research and practical applications in workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures.

Abstract: Data-intensive scientific workflows increasingly rely on high-performance computing (HPC) systems, complementing traditional Grid and Cloud platforms. However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system's design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a batch denoising framework and a STACKING algorithm to optimize edge-generated content and transmission for AIGC services, achieving superior quality and reduced delays under service constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently provide high-quality AIGC services in wireless edge networks by addressing challenges in content generation and transmission delays.

Method: The authors propose a batch denoising framework and introduce the STACKING algorithm for optimizing denoising steps without relying on specific content quality functions. They also optimize bandwidth allocation across AIGC services to meet delay constraints.

Result: The proposed solution significantly improves AIGC service quality while reducing delays, as demonstrated through simulation results.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that the STACKING algorithm and batch denoising framework effectively balance quality and latency in AIGC service provisioning in edge networks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) service provisioning in wireless edge networks involves two phases: content generation on edge servers and content transmission to mobile devices. In this paper, we take image generation as a representative application and propose a batch denoising framework, followed by a joint optimization of content generation and transmission, with the objective of maximizing the average AIGC service quality under an end-to-end service delay constraint. Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising. The STACKING operates independently of any specific form of the content quality function and achieves lower computational complexity. Building on the batch solution, we further optimize bandwidth allocation across AIGC services. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm in delivering high-quality, lower-latency AIGC services.

TL;DR: The paper proposes algorithms for computing a minimal dominating set in anonymous graphs using mobile agents, achieving linear-time complexity in the synchronous model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address efficient computation of classical graph problems, like minimal dominating sets, using mobile agents in distributed systems.

Method: They design two new algorithms based on a recent dispersion algorithm for mobile agents, achieving $O(n)$ time complexity with $O(\log n)$ memory per agent and no global parameter knowledge.

Result: The algorithms compute a minimal dominating set, construct a spanning tree, and perform leader election in $O(n)$ rounds, improving prior complexity results in the field.

Conclusion: These algorithms demonstrate efficient use of mobile agents for fundamental graph-based distributed problems, contributing significant advancements to time and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Mobile agents have emerged as a powerful framework for solving fundamental graph problems in distributed settings in recent times. These agents, modelled as autonomous physical or software entities, possess local computation power, finite memory and have the ability to traverse a graph, offering efficient solutions to a range of classical problems. In this work, we focus on the problem of computing a \emph{minimal dominating set} (mDS) in anonymous graphs using mobile agents. Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolarStore, a compressed shared storage solution for cloud-native RDBMSs, utilizing dual-layer compression to reduce storage costs while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cost concerns in cloud-native RDBMSs caused by storage expenses and the inefficiencies of existing compression methods, particularly in balancing flexibility, performance overheads, and workload diversity.

Method: Developing PolarStore, a system that integrates in-storage hardware-based compression (PolarCSD) with lightweight software-based compression, alongside database-specific optimizations and hardware improvements to enhance stability and cluster efficiency.

Result: PolarStore, deployed on thousands of servers managing over 100 PB of data for PolarDB, achieves a compression ratio of 3.55, reduces storage costs by 60%, and maintains performance similar to uncompressed systems.

Conclusion: PolarStore demonstrates that a hybrid software-hardware compression approach with system-level optimizations effectively reduces storage costs without sacrificing system performance, making it a viable solution for cloud-native RDBMSs.

Abstract: In recent years, resource elasticity and cost optimization have become essential for RDBMSs. While cloud-native RDBMSs provide elastic computing resources via disaggregated computing and storage, storage costs remain a critical user concern. Consequently, data compression emerges as an effective strategy to reduce storage costs. However, existing compression approaches in RDBMSs present a stark trade-off: software-based approaches incur significant performance overheads, while hardware-based alternatives lack the flexibility required for diverse database workloads. In this paper, we present PolarStore, a compressed shared storage system for cloud-native RDBMSs. PolarStore employs a dual-layer compression mechanism that combines in-storage compression in PolarCSD hardware with lightweight compression in software. This design leverages the strengths of both approaches. PolarStore also incorporates database-oriented optimizations to maintain high performance on critical I/O paths. Drawing from large-scale deployment experiences, we also introduce hardware improvements for PolarCSD to ensure host-level stability and propose a compression-aware scheduling scheme to improve cluster-level space efficiency. PolarStore is currently deployed on thousands of storage servers within PolarDB, managing over 100 PB of data. It achieves a compression ratio of 3.55 and reduces storage costs by approximately 60%. Remarkably, these savings are achieved while maintaining performance comparable to uncompressed clusters.

TL;DR: SwitchDelta proposes a novel mechanism to improve the performance of ordered writes in distributed storage systems by offloading metadata updates to network switches, resulting in significant improvements in both write latency and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address performance bottlenecks in distributed storage systems caused by the need for ordered writes to maintain strong consistency between data and metadata.

Method: SwitchDelta uses programmable switches to buffer metadata updates, allowing data to become visible within the network while maintaining strong consistency. The approach leverages a best-effort design to overcome resource limitations in switches and incorporates a new metadata update protocol.

Result: SwitchDelta achieves up to a 52.4% reduction in write latency and a 126.9% increase in throughput in write-heavy workloads across various distributed in-memory storage systems.

Conclusion: By moving metadata updates out of the critical path and utilizing programmable switches, SwitchDelta provides an efficient solution to improve the performance of distributed storage systems while preserving strong consistency.

Abstract: Distributed storage systems typically maintain strong consistency between data nodes and metadata nodes by adopting ordered writes: 1) first installing data; 2) then updating metadata to make data visible.We propose SwitchDelta to accelerate ordered writes by moving metadata updates out of the critical path. It buffers in-flight metadata updates in programmable switches to enable data visibility in the network and retain strong consistency. SwitchDelta uses a best-effort data plane design to overcome the resource limitation of switches and designs a novel metadata update protocol to exploit the benefits of in-network data visibility. We evaluate SwitchDelta in three distributed in-memory storage systems: log-structured key-value stores, file systems, and secondary indexes. The evaluation shows that SwitchDelta reduces the latency of write operations by up to 52.4% and boosts the throughput by up to 126.9% under write-heavy workloads.

TL;DR: MTMC is a hierarchical framework combining reinforcement learning and LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation, achieving superior accuracy and speedup compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address the challenge of crafting optimized GPU kernels, which currently requires expert knowledge and lacks portability. Existing LLM-based approaches fail to balance correctness and efficiency.

Method: MTMC adopts a two-stage hierarchical approach: Macro Thinking uses reinforcement learning to develop optimization strategies, while Micro Coding utilizes lightweight LLMs to incrementally implement these strategies, overcoming challenges in kernel generation.

Result: MTMC demonstrates enhanced accuracy and speedup metrics on benchmarks like KernelBench and TritonBench, surpassing state-of-the-art LLMs and expert-crafted kernels.

Conclusion: The MTMC framework effectively resolves issues of correctness and efficiency in GPU kernel generation, showcasing its practicality and advantages in automating AI and scientific computing workflows.

Abstract: Developing high-performance GPU kernels is critical for AI and scientific computing, but remains challenging due to its reliance on expert crafting and poor portability. While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the memory bottlenecks in GPU-accelerated systems caused by increasing LLM model sizes and long-context inference demands, which existing solutions like RDMA struggle to manage effectively.

Method: The proposed system, Beluga, uses CXL switches to enable low-latency, shared memory access for GPUs and CPUs, simplifying programming and minimizing synchronization issues. It also introduces Beluga-KVCache for optimized LLM inference.

Result: Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 7.35x throughput improvement during vLLM inference compared to RDMA-based systems.

Conclusion: Beluga represents a breakthrough in shared memory access for GPUs, utilizing CXL technology to overcome existing limitations and significantly improve the performance of LLM inference tasks.

Abstract: The rapid increase in LLM model sizes and the growing demand for long-context inference have made memory a critical bottleneck in GPU-accelerated serving systems. Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.

It features LCD screens for visualization of the local state of blockchain ledgers on each RPi, making it ideal for educational purposes and to demonstrate fundamental blockchain concepts to a wide audience. For example, a functioning PoW consensus is easily visible from the LCD screens, as well as consensus degradation which might arise from various factors, including peer-to-peer topology and communication latency - all parameters which can be configured from the central web-based interface.

Conclusion: The proposed PK-means GA method significantly enhances pilot assignment efficiency and low-latency performance, making it ideal for future wireless networks like 6G.

Abstract: The assignment of the pilot sequence is a critical challenge in massive MIMO systems, as sharing the same pilot sequence among multiple users causes interference, which degrades the accuracy of the channel estimation. This problem, equivalent to the NP-hard graph coloring problem, directly impacts real-time applications such as autonomous driving and industrial IoT, where minimizing channel estimation time is crucial. This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds. Within Vivado implementation, different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and function inlining are applied to realize the reported speedup.

Motivation: Optimizing prefix adder designs is challenging due to complex design rules and a vast design space.

Method: Utilizing a specialized GPT model, PrefixGPT uses a customized Transformer architecture with legality masks and a two-phase training approach to generate valid and optimized prefix adder designs.

Result: PrefixGPT discovers new designs that improve ADP by 7.7% and reduce average ADP by up to 79.1%, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PrefixGPT effectively applies GPT models to hardware design principles, demonstrating its capability for enhancing design efficiency and quality in compute-intensive applications.

Abstract: Prefix adders are widely used in compute-intensive applications for their high speed. However, designing optimized prefix adders is challenging due to strict design rules and an exponentially large design space. We introduce PrefixGPT, a generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that directly generates optimized prefix adders from scratch. Our approach represents an adder's topology as a two-dimensional coordinate sequence and applies a legality mask during generation, ensuring every design is valid by construction. PrefixGPT features a customized decoder-only Transformer architecture. The model is first pre-trained on a corpus of randomly synthesized valid prefix adders to learn design rules and then fine-tuned to navigate the design space for optimized design quality. Compared with existing works, PrefixGPT not only finds a new optimal design with a 7.7% improved area-delay product (ADP) but exhibits superior exploration quality, lowering the average ADP by up to 79.1%. This demonstrates the potential of GPT-style models to first master complex hardware design principles and then apply them for more efficient design optimization.

Result: The methodology successfully models and predicts tourist movements using data from social networks, demonstrated efficiently using Paris as the case study.

Conclusion: This paper shows that the adapted grammatical inference algorithm and hidden Markov model approach can effectively predict future tourist movements, offering valuable insights for tourism marketing and decision-making.

Abstract: Nowadays, social networks are becoming a popular way of analyzing tourist behavior, thanks to the digital traces left by travelers during their stays on these networks. The massive amount of data generated; by the propensity of tourists to share comments and photos during their trip; makes it possible to model their journeys and analyze their behavior. Predicting the next movement of tourists plays a key role in tourism marketing to understand demand and improve decision support. In this paper, we propose a method to understand and to learn tourists' movements based on social network data analysis to predict future movements. The method relies on a machine learning grammatical inference algorithm. A major contribution in this paper is to adapt the grammatical inference algorithm to the context of big data. Our method produces a hidden Markov model representing the movements of a group of tourists. The hidden Markov model is flexible and editable with new data. The capital city of France, Paris is selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Partial Information Decomposition (PID)-based framework to quantify contributions of modalities within multimodal models, aiming to provide interpretable insights beyond accuracy-drop methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for quantifying modality contributions in multimodal models rely on accuracy-based approaches, which fail to capture how modalities interact and influence each other, especially in cross-attention architectures.

Method: The study introduces a scalable framework employing Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to analyze embeddings in terms of unique, redundant, and synergistic components of predictive information. It utilizes an inference-only algorithm based on Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) for efficient analysis without retraining.

Result: The framework enables dataset-level and layer-level analysis of modality contributions, providing a principled, representation-driven view of multimodal behaviors.

Conclusion: The paper’s framework offers clearer and more interpretable insights into multimodal model contributions than traditional accuracy-based metrics, highlighting interactions between modalities.

Abstract: Quantifying modality contributions in multimodal models remains a challenge, as existing approaches conflate the notion of contribution itself. Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining. This provides a principled, representation-level view of multimodal behavior, offering clearer and more interpretable insights than outcome-based metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of ambiguity, redundancy, and unstructured data in free-form natural language descriptions for Verilog code generation.

Method: The proposed two-stage training framework focuses on Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization within a structured intermediate space called CRUX.

Result: The experiments prove that CRUX-V achieves superior performance on Verilog generation benchmarks and shows transferability to other code models.

Conclusion: CRUX effectively narrows the gap between natural language and precise Verilog generation, offering a significant improvement for HDL tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.

*Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,James Cheney,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method combining unsupervised anomaly detection using AutoEncoders and an active learning loop to enhance APT detection in imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the scarcity of labeled data in cybersecurity for detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and improve their detection accuracy with minimal manual labeling effort.

Method: The study introduces an Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder framework for detecting anomalies, coupled with an active learning loop where uncertain samples are labeled selectively to improve the model iteratively.

Result: The framework was evaluated on real-world provenance databases from DARPA, covering multiple operating systems and showing significant improvements in APT detection rates compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances APT detection in highly imbalanced datasets while minimizing labeling costs, showcasing superior performance in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their stealthy and long-term nature. Modern supervised learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that leverages AutoEncoders for unsupervised anomaly detection, augmented by active learning to iteratively improve the detection of APT anomalies. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The results have shown significant improvements in detection rates during active learning and better performance compared to other existing approaches.

*Haojin Yang,Rui Hu,Zequn Sun,Rui Zhou,Yujun Cai,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WavefrontDiffusion introduces an adaptive decoding method that expands active tokens outward from finalized positions, achieving state-of-the-art performance in reasoning and code generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Language Models face challenges with denoising strategies that often disrupt output coherence or semantic structure.

Method: Proposes WavefrontDiffusion, a dynamic decoding approach expanding tokens outward from finalized positions, maintaining semantic structure and keeping computational costs comparable to block-based methods.

Result: WavefrontDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across reasoning and code generation benchmarks while improving semantic fidelity in generated outputs.

Conclusion: Adaptive scheduling in WavefrontDiffusion enhances text generation coherence and efficiency, proving its advantage over other denoising strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for text generation and are becoming a competitive alternative to autoregressive models. The denoising strategy plays an important role in determining the quality of their outputs. Mainstream denoising strategies include Standard Diffusion and BlockDiffusion. Standard Diffusion performs global denoising without restricting the update range, often finalizing incomplete context and causing premature end-of-sequence predictions. BlockDiffusion updates fixed-size blocks in a preset order, but its rigid structure can break apart coherent semantic units and disrupt reasoning. We present WavefrontDiffusion, a dynamic decoding approach that expands a wavefront of active tokens outward from finalized positions. This adaptive process follows the natural flow of semantic structure while keeping computational cost equal to block-based methods. Across four benchmarks in reasoning and code generation, WavefrontDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing outputs with higher semantic fidelity, showing the value of adaptive scheduling for more coherent and efficient generation.

### [297] [When Should Neural Data Inform Welfare? A Critical Framework for Policy Uses of Neuroeconomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19548)
*Yiven,Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines how neural data can be meaningfully used to inform welfare judgments, proposing a framework linking neural signals, decision models, and normative welfare criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the legitimacy and conditions under which neural data and computational models inform welfare analysis, especially given their growing use in policy and commercial decisions.

Method: The paper establishes a model-based framework, using an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, to connect neural activity to welfare judgments and introduces a checklist for regulators and NeuroAI system designers.

Result: It identifies that neural data aids welfare judgments only with validated neural-computational mappings, decision models capturing true interests, and explicitly defined welfare criteria.

Conclusion: Internal neural or computational signals cannot serve as direct welfare measures without an explicitly defined normative framework, highlighting gaps in current neuroeconomic and policy interpretations.

Abstract: Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.

### [298] [From One Attack Domain to Another: Contrastive Transfer Learning with Siamese Networks for APT Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20500)
*Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses the challenge of detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) with a hybrid transfer framework including Transfer Learning, Explainable AI, and Siamese networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting APTs is challenging due to their adaptability, class imbalance, and feature complexity. Traditional methods lack generalization across domains and fail in novel attack scenarios.

Method: The paper integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks with an attention-based autoencoder for cross-domain knowledge transfer and feature stability using SHAP explanations.

Result: The framework improves detection scores across domains using real-world and synthetic data. It outperforms traditional algorithms in anomaly separability and robustness.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework presents a scalable and transferable solution for cross-domain APT detection with enhanced explainability and accuracy.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due to their stealth, persistence, and adaptability. Traditional machine learning detectors struggle with class imbalance, high dimensional features, and scarce real world traces. They often lack transferability-performing well in the training domain but degrading in novel attack scenarios. We propose a hybrid transfer framework that integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks to improve cross-domain generalization. An attention-based autoencoder supports knowledge transfer across domains, while Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) select stable, informative features to reduce dimensionality and computational cost. A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift. We evaluate on real-world traces from the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) program and augment with synthetic attack scenarios to test robustness. Across source to target transfers, the approach delivers improved detection scores with classical and deep baselines, demonstrating a scalable, explainable, and transferable solution for APT detection.

### [299] [Exploiting the Experts: Unauthorized Compression in MoE-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19480)
*Pinaki Prasad Guha Neogi,Ahmad Mohammadshirazi,Dheeraj Kulshrestha,Rajiv Ramnath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the vulnerability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs) to unauthorized compression through expert pruning and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the licensing and security risks posed by modular structures in MoE architectures that allow adversaries to bypass constraints via expert pruning and cheap fine-tuning.

Method: Developed an expert attribution framework to identify critical experts for task performance, evaluated pruning impacts using active learning-driven fine-tuning, and proposed defense strategies such as entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning.

Result: Found a significant knowledge loss-recovery trade-off during pruning, with degraded performance unless targeted expert re-alignments are implemented.

Conclusion: The paper highlights expert pruning as both a security vulnerability and an area for defense, proposing systematic strategies to resist unauthorized model adaptation and ensure secure specialization.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are increasingly adopted in large language models (LLMs) for their scalability and efficiency. However, their modular structure introduces a unique vulnerability: adversaries can attempt to compress or repurpose models by pruning experts and cheaply fine-tuning the remainder, effectively bypassing licensing and security constraints. In this paper, we systematically study the prunability of MoE-LLMs under task-specific usage. We first develop an expert attribution framework that identifies the subset of experts most responsible for a given task, then evaluate the performance trade-offs of pruning and re-aligning these experts using active learning-driven fine-tuning. Our findings reveal a critical knowledge loss--recovery trade-off: while certain experts can be isolated to retain task accuracy, significant degradation occurs without targeted re-alignment. Based on this analysis, we propose defense strategies that aim to make MoE models harder to compress and fine-tune without authorization, including entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning protocols that resist unauthorized adaptation. By positioning expert pruning as both a threat vector and a defense target, this work highlights the dual-use nature of MoE modularity and provides the first systematic evaluation framework for secure specialization of MoE-LLMs.

### [300] [Quality analysis and evaluation prediction of RAG retrieval based on machine learning algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19481)
*Ruoxin Zhang,Zhizhao Wen,Chao Wang,Chenchen Tang,Puyang Xu,Yifan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing retrieval quality in retrieval-augmented generation systems using an optimized machine learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in retrieval-augmented generation, particularly the distortion caused by retrieval module inefficiencies in handling tabular data features.

Method: Proposed XGBoost regression model is enhanced with feature engineering and particle swarm optimization, while correlation analysis examines interactions like semantic similarity and diversity.

Result: The VMD PSO BiLSTM model demonstrates significantly lower error rates (e.g., MSE, RMSE) and higher R2 values than traditional models like decision trees and AdaBoost.

Conclusion: This advancement optimizes retrieval relevance and improves the generation accuracy of RAG systems, contributing to better implementations of related technologies.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of large language models, retrieval enhanced generation technology has been widely used due to its ability to integrate external knowledge to improve output accuracy. However, the performance of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the retrieval module. If the retrieval results have low relevance to user needs or contain noisy information, it will directly lead to distortion of the generated content. In response to the performance bottleneck of existing models in processing tabular features, this paper proposes an XGBoost machine learning regression model based on feature engineering and particle swarm optimization. Correlation analysis shows that answer_quality is positively correlated with doc_delevance by 0.66, indicating that document relevance has a significant positive effect on answer quality, and improving document relevance may enhance answer quality; The strong negative correlations between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity were -0.89 and -0.88, respectively, indicating a tradeoff between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity. In other words, as the former two increased, diversity significantly decreased. The experimental results comparing decision trees, AdaBoost, etc. show that the VMD PSO BiLSTM model is superior in all evaluation indicators, with significantly lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE compared to the comparison model. The R2 value is higher, indicating that its prediction accuracy, stability, and data interpretation ability are more outstanding. This achievement provides an effective path for optimizing the retrieval quality and improving the generation effect of RAG system, and has important value in promoting the implementation and application of related technologies.

*Wanzhe Xu,Yutong Dai,Yitao Yang,Martin Loza,Weihang Zhang,Yang Cui,Xin Zeng,Sung Joon Park,Kenta Nakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniTFT, a deep learning framework aimed at accurately predicting vital signs and lab results in ICUs under challenging conditions. It demonstrates improved performance with interpretable attention patterns across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate time-series predictions in ICU settings, where noisy vital signs and missing lab values complicate early interventions and precision medicine.

Method: OmniTFT, based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer, implements methods like sliding window sampling, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage, hierarchical selection, and attention calibration for robust forecasting.

Result: OmniTFT achieves substantial improvements in forecasting vital signs and lab results on MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets, ensuring generalizability and consistent performance.

Conclusion: OmniTFT simplifies heterogeneous clinical data modeling, improves prediction accuracy, and offers interpretability, making it valuable for ICU decision support systems.

Abstract: Accurate multivariate time-series prediction of vital signs and laboratory results is crucial for early intervention and precision medicine in intensive care units (ICUs). However, vital signs are often noisy and exhibit rapid fluctuations, while laboratory tests suffer from missing values, measurement lags, and device-specific bias, making integrative forecasting highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Specifically, OmniTFT implements four novel strategies to enhance performance: sliding window equalized sampling to balance physiological states, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage to stabilize rare-class representations, hierarchical variable selection to guide model attention toward informative feature clusters, and influence-aligned attention calibration to enhance robustness during abrupt physiological changes. By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability. Across forecasting tasks, OmniTFT achieves substantial performance improvement for both vital signs and laboratory results on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets. Its attention patterns are interpretable and consistent with known pathophysiology, underscoring its potential utility for quantitative decision support in clinical care.

*Ben Shaw,Adam Rustad,Sofia Pelagalli Maia,Jake S. Rhodes,Kevin R. Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on extending Random Forest proximities to general supervised distance-based machine learning by introducing a generalized Proximity Forest (PF) model and a regression variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of Random Forest for proximity-based tasks (e.g., outlier detection, imputation), especially in contexts not ideally suited to RF.

Method: They generalize the Proximity Forest model to support broader machine learning tasks, including regression. Additionally, they propose using the generalized PF model as a meta-learning framework.

Result: The experimental results show that the generalized PF model offers advantages over Random Forest and $k$-nearest neighbors models.

Conclusion: The generalized PF model boosts proximity-based machine learning utility and applicability across diverse tasks beyond RF limitations.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the utility of Random Forest (RF) proximities for various supervised machine learning tasks, including outlier detection, missing data imputation, and visualization. However, the utility of the RF proximities depends upon the success of the RF model, which itself is not the ideal model in all contexts. RF proximities have recently been extended to time series by means of the distance-based Proximity Forest (PF) model, among others, affording time series analysis with the benefits of RF proximities. In this work, we introduce the generalized PF model, thereby extending RF proximities to all contexts in which supervised distance-based machine learning can occur. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the PF model for regression tasks. We also introduce the notion of using the generalized PF model as a meta-learning framework, extending supervised imputation capability to any pre-trained classifier. We experimentally demonstrate the unique advantages of the generalized PF model compared with both the RF model and the $k$-nearest neighbors model.

*Lei Wang,Zikun Ye,Jinglong Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining fine-tuning and rectification to optimize large language models (LLMs) for applications in market research and social science, utilizing data-driven sample allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for improving the performance of large language models in generating human-like responses by combining fine-tuning and rectification methods.

Method: The authors develop a new framework using variance minimization as the fine-tuning objective and a data-driven sample allocation strategy. Empirical scaling laws are leveraged to allocate labeled samples optimally between fine-tuning and rectification stages.

Result: Empirical analysis shows that the proposed framework outperforms using fine-tuning or rectification alone, with improved estimation and inference performance.

Conclusion: The combined approach of fine-tuning and rectification, optimized by sample allocation, enhances the effectiveness of LLMs in social science and market research applications.

Abstract: Driven by recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a growing body of work demonstrates the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses in market research and social science applications. Two primary approaches can be applied to improve the performance of LLMs: fine-tuning, which aligns LLM predictions more closely with human responses, and rectification, which corrects biases in LLM outputs. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines fine-tuning and rectification, and optimally allocates limited labeled samples across the two stages. Unlike the conventional objective that minimizes the mean squared prediction errors, we propose to minimize the variance of the prediction errors as the fine-tuning objective, which is optimal for the downstream rectification stage. Building on this insight, we leverage empirical scaling laws to develop a data-driven method for optimally splitting samples between the fine-tuning and rectification stages. Empirical analysis validates our framework, demonstrating improved estimation and inference performance compared to using either fine-tuning or rectification alone.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RFX, a production-ready Python implementation of Random Forests focusing on proximity matrix optimizations and classification with compression and acceleration for large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the memory bottleneck in Random Forest analysis and enable it to scale for datasets with 60,000+ samples, while improving usability and computational performance.

Method: Implemented RFX v1.0 with techniques including QLORA compression, CPU TriBlock for memory efficiency, GPU optimization strategies, and advanced visualization, ensuring cross-validation on multiple modes.

Result: Demonstrated significant memory savings (e.g., 12,500x with QLORA), faster processing using GPUs, and capability to handle datasets with up to 200,000+ samples.

Conclusion: RFX v1.0 eliminates proximity memory constraints, facilitating scalable and efficient Random Forest analysis and setting up for future enhancements like regression and unsupervised learning in v2.0.

Abstract: RFX (Random Forests X), where X stands for compression or quantization, presents a production-ready implementation of Breiman and Cutler's Random Forest classification methodology in Python. RFX v1.0 provides complete classification: out-of-bag error estimation, overall and local importance measures, proximity matrices with QLORA compression, case-wise analysis, and interactive visualization (rfviz)--all with CPU and GPU acceleration. Regression, unsupervised learning, CLIQUE importance, and RF-GAP proximity are planned for v2.0.
  This work introduces four solutions addressing the proximity matrix memory bottleneck limiting Random Forest analysis to ~60,000 samples: (1) QLORA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) compression for GPU proximity matrices, reducing memory from 80GB to 6.4MB for 100k samples (12,500x compression with INT8 quantization) while maintaining 99% geometric structure preservation, (2) CPU TriBlock proximity--combining upper-triangle storage with block-sparse thresholding--achieving 2.7x memory reduction with lossless quality, (3) SM-aware GPU batch sizing achieving 95% GPU utilization, and (4) GPU-accelerated 3D MDS visualization computing embeddings directly from low-rank factors using power iteration.
  Validation across four implementation modes (GPU/CPU x case-wise/non-case-wise) demonstrates correct implementation. GPU achieves 1.4x speedup over CPU for overall importance with 500+ trees. Proximity computation scales from 1,000 to 200,000+ samples (requiring GPU QLORA), with CPU TriBlock filling the gap for medium-scale datasets (10K-50K samples). RFX v1.0 eliminates the proximity memory bottleneck, enabling proximity-based Random Forest analysis on datasets orders of magnitude larger than previously feasible. Open-source production-ready classification following Breiman and Cutler's original methodology.

*Subramanyam Sahoo,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Divya Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'Alignment Trilemma,' which states that RLHF systems cannot simultaneously achieve representativeness, computational feasibility, and robustness. Current systems compromise on representativeness, and the paper explains observed issues in RLHF implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent challenge and trade-offs faced while aligning large language models using RLHF, particularly the safety-fairness trade-off, scalability to diverse populations, and sensitivity to biases.

Method: Develops a complexity-theoretic framework combining statistical learning theory and robust optimization to formalize and analyze the challenges, proving inherent computational limits in balancing representativeness, tractability, and robustness.

Result: Proves that achieving representativeness and robustness across global populations necessitates computational resources that grow super-polynomially with context dimensionality, explaining why current methods sacrifice representativeness.

Conclusion: The paper identifies that current RLHF systems fail to capture diverse human values, resulting in known pathologies, and provides suggestions for revising alignment approaches to better navigate inherent trade-offs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used for aligning large language models, yet practitioners face a persistent puzzle: improving safety often reduces fairness, scaling to diverse populations becomes computationally intractable, and making systems robust often amplifies majority biases. We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation. Our framework provides a unified explanation for documented RLHF pathologies including preference collapse, sycophancy, and systematic bias amplification. We conclude with concrete directions for navigating these fundamental trade-offs through strategic relaxations of alignment requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GAN-based learning approach to improve CSI feedback in mMIMO OFDM systems, addressing adaptability and catastrophic forgetting challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt in dynamic environments and suffer from performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: A GAN-based generative model is employed as a memory unit to preserve knowledge and ensure performance consistency across diverse scenarios.

Result: The proposed approach enhances generalization capabilities of the DAE framework, maintains low memory overhead, and integrates well with other models.

Conclusion: The GAN-based approach effectively tackles challenges of adaptability and knowledge retention in CSI feedback, showcasing robustness and applicability.

Abstract: Deep autoencoder (DAE) frameworks have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. However, existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt to dynamic environments caused by user mobility, requiring retraining when encountering new CSI distributions. Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback. By using a GAN generator as a memory unit, our method preserves knowledge from past environments and ensures consistently high performance across diverse scenarios without forgetting. Simulation results show that the proposed approach enhances the generalization capability of the DAE framework while maintaining low memory overhead. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated with other advanced CSI feedback models, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

*Shivam Pal,Sakshi Varshney,Piyush Rai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of deep neural networks learning shortcuts that harm out-of-distribution generalization. The proposed method replaces robust representation learning with robust function learning by injecting targeted latent noise during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by addressing the prevalent issue of shortcut learning in deep neural networks.

Method: The authors propose training a classifier with functional invariance to shortcut signals through disentangled latent space and targeted latent noise injections. These measures isolate core and spurious features, suppress learning shortcuts, and enhance reliance on meaningful signals.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art OOD performance on shortcut learning benchmarks, showcasing enhanced robustness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Learning robust functions instead of representations provides a simple, scalable tool to mitigate shortcut learning and improve model performance in OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning shortcuts, spurious and easily learned correlations in training data that cause severe failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. A dominant line of work seeks robustness by learning a robust representation, often explicitly partitioning the latent space into core and spurious components; this approach can be complex, brittle, and difficult to scale. We take a different approach, instead of a robust representation, we learn a robust function. We present a simple and effective training method that renders the classifier functionally invariant to shortcut signals. Our method operates within a disentangled latent space, which is essential as it isolates spurious and core features into distinct dimensions. This separation enables the identification of candidate shortcut features by their strong correlation with the label, used as a proxy for semantic simplicity. The classifier is then desensitized to these features by injecting targeted, anisotropic latent noise during training. We analyze this as targeted Jacobian regularization, which forces the classifier to ignore spurious features and rely on more complex, core semantic signals. The result is state-of-the-art OOD performance on established shortcut learning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional machine learning models under closed-world assumptions and enhance their ability to handle novel and continuous learning tasks.

Method: The model discovers unknown classes in the data, creates novel classes, and learns incrementally for these classes to enable continual learning.

Result: The model achieved strong performance, outperforming existing methods in open-world learning, with an average accuracy of 82.54% over four iterations and a minimum accuracy of 65.87%.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully enables open and continuous learning, highlighting its potential for dynamic and adaptive intelligence systems.

Abstract: Open-world machine learning is an emerging technique in artificial intelligence, where conventional machine learning models often follow closed-world assumptions, which can hinder their ability to retain previously learned knowledge for future tasks. However, automated intelligence systems must learn about novel classes and previously known tasks. The proposed model offers novel learning classes in an open and continuous learning environment. It consists of two different but connected tasks. First, it discovers unknown classes in the data and creates novel classes; next, it learns how to perform class incrementally for each new class. Together, they enable continual learning, allowing the system to expand its understanding of the data and improve over time. The proposed model also outperformed existing approaches in open-world learning. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong performance in continuous learning, achieving a highest average accuracy of 82.54% over four iterations and a minimum accuracy of 65.87%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ModHiFi, a model modification algorithm that doesn't require gradients or training data, leveraging Subset Fidelity scores for tasks like pruning and unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to modify open-weight models without access to their training data or loss functions, especially in computationally constrained scenarios.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze global reconstruction error in Lipschitz-continuous networks, introduce Subset Fidelity metric, and propose ModHiFi for efficient model modification.

Result: ModHiFi achieves notable results in pruning (11% speedup on ImageNet) and unlearning (complete on CIFAR-10) without requiring traditional resources like data or loss functions.

Conclusion: ModHiFi offers a promising alternative for model modification tasks, reducing dependency on resource-heavy techniques like gradients or extensive labels, with strong performance in practical applications.

Abstract: Open weight models, which are ubiquitous, rarely provide access to their training data or loss function. This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning constrained by this unavailability an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components via their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we use to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires no training data or loss function access. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models. ModHiFi-U, for classwise unlearning, achieves complete unlearning on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning and demonstrates competitive performance on Swin Transformers.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate improved solution quality in comparison to neural solvers alone, along with better out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates neural and parameterized algorithms to enhance solution quality and overcome existing limitations of neural CO solvers.

Abstract: Neural models have shown promise in solving NP-hard graph combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes.
  We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone.
  We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers. Furthermore, by using the neural model only for exploratory advisory signals, our framework exhibits improved out-of-distribution generalization, addressing a key limitation of existing neural CO solvers.

### [311] [A Systematic Study of Compression Ordering for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19495)
*Shivansh Chhawri,Rahul Mahadik,Suparna Rooj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing compression techniques on a language model, finding that the order of techniques critically impacts results, recommending a specific sequence for best outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the challenge of deploying large language models in resource-constrained settings by understanding and optimizing the interplay of popular compression methods.

Method: The method involves systematically applying and evaluating knowledge distillation, structured pruning, and low-bit quantization independently and in combination on the Qwen2.5 3B model.

Result: The study finds that quantization offers the highest standalone compression but can cause severe degradation when applied early. The sequence Pruning → Knowledge Distillation → Quantization yields the best compression ratio (3.68x) while preserving model quality.

Conclusion: The research provides actionable insights into designing effective compression sequences and highlights the critical role of proper technique ordering to optimize balance between size reduction and model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources, making model compression essential for efficient deployment in constrained environments. Among the dominant compression techniques: knowledge distillation, structured pruning, and low-bit quantization, their individual effects are well studied, but their interactions and optimal sequencing remain unclear. This work systematically examines how these techniques perform both independently and in combination when applied to the Qwen2.5 3B model. We evaluate multiple compression pipelines, including single, and proposed three-technique sequences, using perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio as metrics. Our experiments show that quantization provides the greatest standalone compression, while pruning introduces moderate quality degradation. Critically, the ordering of techniques significantly affects the final model quality: the sequence Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, Quantization (P-KD-Q) yields the best balance, achieving a 3.68x compression ratio while preserving strong instruction-following and language understanding capabilities. Conversely, pipelines applying quantization early suffer severe performance degradation due to irreversible information loss that impairs subsequent training. Overall, this study offers practical insight into designing effective, ordering-aware compression pipelines for deploying LLMs in resource-limited settings.

### [312] [Lower Complexity Bounds for Nonconvex-Strongly-Convex Bilevel Optimization with First-Order Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19656)
*Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the lower bound guarantees in bilevel optimization and establishes new, nontrivial deterministic and stochastic lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of lower bound guarantees in bilevel optimization, since upper bounds are extensively studied, but lower bounds remain elusive due to the structure's complexity.

Method: The study introduces challenging instances for bilevel optimization and analyzes the deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models within nonconvex-strongly-convex settings.

Result: The paper proves the minimum oracle call requirements for deterministic ($Ω(κ^{3/2}ε^{-2})$) and stochastic ($Ω(κ^{5/2}ε^{-4})$) models to find $ε$-accurate solutions, surpassing previous bounds from related scenarios.

Conclusion: There are significant gaps between upper and lower bounds for bilevel optimization, and the findings emphasize the need for further exploration of simplified regimes for better understanding of the problem's complexity.

Abstract: Although upper bound guarantees for bilevel optimization have been widely studied, progress on lower bounds has been limited due to the complexity of the bilevel structure. In this work, we focus on the smooth nonconvex-strongly-convex setting and develop new hard instances that yield nontrivial lower bounds under deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models. In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $Ω(κ^{3/2}ε^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $ε$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems. In the stochastic case, we show that at least $Ω(κ^{5/2}ε^{-4})$ stochastic oracle calls are necessary, again strengthening the best known bounds in related settings. Our results expose substantial gaps between current upper and lower bounds for bilevel optimization and suggest that even simplified regimes, such as those with quadratic lower-level objectives, warrant further investigation toward understanding the optimal complexity of bilevel optimization under standard first-order oracles.

TL;DR: Xmodel-2.5 offers a cost-effective alternative to large language models by combining efficient parameterization, strategic training curriculums, and precision techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are challenging to deploy due to high computational demands, necessitating efficient alternatives for cost-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Xmodel-2.5 uses maximal-update parameterization ($μ$P), AdamW-to-Muon optimizer switching during training, FP8-mixed-precision, and a structured curriculum for enhanced performance on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Xmodel-2.5 balances reasoning skills and computational cost effectively, making it suitable for edge or cost-sensitive deployments. Resources for training and evaluation are openly available.

Abstract: Large language models deliver strong reasoning and tool-use skills, yet their computational demands make them impractical for edge or cost-sensitive deployments. We present \textbf{Xmodel-2.5}, a 1.3-billion-parameter small language model designed as a \emph{drop-in agent core}. Training with maximal-update parameterization ($μ$P) allows hyper-parameters tuned on a 20M-parameter proxy to transfer directly to the full model, even under the parameter-tied \emph{tie-word-embedding} architecture. A 1.4T-token Warmup--Stable--Decay curriculum is used, and we further show that \textbf{switching from AdamW to Muon during the decay phase} improves the 13-task reasoning average by 4.58\,\% while keeping every other hyper-parameter fixed, verifying that early AdamW stability can be paired with late Muon sharpening for better downstream performance. FP8-mixed-precision training balances accuracy and throughput.

*Jiaxin Shi,Michalis K. Titsias*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical interpretation of reweighted losses in diffusion models, presenting a novel framework for improved training. It demonstrates notable advancements in pixel-space image modeling using masked diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in data log-likelihood and KL-divergences during training diffusion models and provide a unified framework for both continuous and discrete models.

Method: The paper constructs time-dependent variational lower bounds on data log-likelihood, integrates them as reweighted objectives, and applies the framework to both continuous Gaussian diffusion and discrete masked diffusion models.

Result: Significant improvements in pixel-space image modeling are showcased by masked diffusion approaches, with sample quality nearing continuous diffusion models.

Conclusion: The framework not only improves training outcomes but also validates the effectiveness of commonly used weighting schemes in masked image models.

Abstract: We derive a new theoretical interpretation of the reweighted losses that are widely used for training diffusion models. Our method is based on constructing a cascade of time-dependent variational lower bounds on the data log-likelihood, that provably improves upon the standard evidence lower bound and results in reduced data-model KL-divergences. Combining such bounds gives rise to reweighted objectives that can be applied to any generative diffusion model including both continuous Gaussian diffusion and masked (discrete) diffusion models. Then, we showcase this framework in masked diffusion and report significant improvements over previous training losses in pixel-space image modeling, approaching sample quality comparable to continuous diffusion models. Our results also provide a theoretical justification for the simple weighting scheme widely used in masked image models.

*Bowen Zhao,Huanlai Xing,Zhiwen Xiao,Jincheng Peng,Li Feng,Xinhan Wang,Rong Qu,Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PeriodNet is a new model designed to improve univariate and multivariate time series forecasting by utilizing period attention mechanisms and reducing cross-variable redundancy, significantly outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite attention mechanisms' success in NLP, they have underperformed in time series forecasting (TSF). Developing better architectures for TSF is vital.

Method: PeriodNet introduces period and sparse period attention mechanisms to analyze periodic patterns and dependencies, utilizes an iterative grouping mechanism for reducing redundancy, and redesigns the Transformer architecture with a period diffuser for better predictions.

Result: PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models across eight datasets in TSF, achieving a 22% relative improvement for long time series predictions.

Conclusion: PeriodNet effectively improves TSF accuracy by leveraging specialized mechanisms for periodic pattern identification and efficient modeling, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has demonstrated remarkable potential in sequence modeling, exemplified by its successful application in natural language processing with models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Despite these advancements, its utilization in time series forecasting (TSF) has yet to meet expectations. Exploring a better network structure for attention in TSF holds immense significance across various domains. In this paper, we present PeriodNet with a brand new structure to forecast univariate and multivariate time series. PeriodNet incorporates period attention and sparse period attention mechanism for analyzing adjacent periods. It enhances the mining of local characteristics, periodic patterns, and global dependencies. For efficient cross-variable modeling, we introduce an iterative grouping mechanism which can directly reduce the cross-variable redundancy. To fully leverage the extracted features on the encoder side, we redesign the entire architecture of the vanilla Transformer and propose a period diffuser for precise multi-period prediction. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on eight datasets, we demonstrate that PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models in both univariate and multivariate TSF scenarios in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error. In particular, PeriodNet achieves a relative improvement of 22% when forecasting time series with a length of 720, in comparison to other models based on the conventional encoder-decoder Transformer architecture.

*Yi Zhang,Tianxiang Xu,Zijian Li,Chao Zhang,Kunyu Zhang,Zhan Gao,Meinuo Li,Xiaohan Zhang,Qichao Qi,Bing Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a selective knowledge unlearning framework to address privacy risks in LLMs, particularly in healthcare, showing high forgetting rates and knowledge preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs pose privacy risks by memorizing sensitive training data, especially in healthcare contexts. The motivation is to selectively unlearn specific knowledge while retaining important competencies for ethical and regulatory compliance.

Method: The framework uses geometric-constrained gradient updates and token-level interventions based on a medical concept hierarchy to distinguish between knowledge for preservation and unlearning.

Result: The method achieves an 82.7% forgetting rate and 88.5% knowledge preservation in evaluations with minimal parameter changes (0.1%) while maintaining privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances privacy, knowledge preservation, and compliance, making it suitable for sensitive applications like healthcare research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but pose substantial privacy risks due to training data memorization, particularly within healthcare contexts involving imperfect or privacy-sensitive patient information. We present a hierarchical dual-strategy framework for selective knowledge unlearning that precisely removes specialized knowledge while preserving fundamental medical competencies. Our approach synergistically integrates geometric-constrained gradient updates to selectively modulate target parameters with concept-aware token-level interventions that distinguish between preservation-critical and unlearning-targeted tokens via a unified four-level medical concept hierarchy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MedMCQA (surgical) and MHQA (anxiety, depression, trauma) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving an 82.7% forgetting rate and 88.5% knowledge preservation. Notably, our framework maintains robust privacy guarantees while requiring modification of only 0.1% of parameters, addressing critical needs for regulatory compliance, auditability, and ethical standards in clinical research.

### [317] [When +1% Is Not Enough: A Paired Bootstrap Protocol for Evaluating Small Improvements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19794)
*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies the problem of over-claimed small percentage improvements in machine learning research and proposes a conservative evaluation protocol to improve result reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of uncertainty estimates and significance tests in reported small performance gains in machine learning papers, which often leads to results overshadowed by random noise rather than actual algorithmic progress.

Method: The paper introduces a conservative evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, BCa bootstrap confidence intervals, and permutation tests on per-seed deltas, aiming to reduce false claims under realistic compute budgets.

Result: The study demonstrates how single runs and unpaired t-tests frequently overstate significance of small gains, whereas their proposed protocol avoids false positives by not declaring significance in low-gain scenarios even with limited resources.

Conclusion: A conservative evaluation protocol acts as an effective safeguard against overstated results, especially in scenarios of small performance gains and constrained computational resources.

Abstract: Recent machine learning papers often report 1-2 percentage point improvements from a single run on a benchmark. These gains are highly sensitive to random seeds, data ordering, and implementation details, yet are rarely accompanied by uncertainty estimates or significance tests. It is therefore unclear when a reported +1-2% reflects a real algorithmic advance versus noise.
  We revisit this problem under realistic compute budgets, where only a few runs are affordable. We propose a simple, PC-friendly evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. The protocol is intentionally conservative and is meant as a guardrail against over-claiming.
  We instantiate it on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News using synthetic no-improvement, small-gain, and medium-gain scenarios. Single runs and unpaired t-tests often suggest significant gains for 0.6-2.0 point improvements, especially on text. With only three seeds, our paired protocol never declares significance in these settings. We argue that such conservative evaluation is a safer default for small gains under tight budgets.

*Hong-Hanh Nguyen-Le,Van-Tuan Tran,Dinh-Thuc Nguyen,Nhien-An Le-Khac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in digital media authenticity posed by realistic synthetic images generated by GANs and Diffusion Models and proposes a semi-supervised detector, TriDetect, to improve cross-generator detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to combat the challenges posed by highly realistic synthetic images and to improve the cross-generator generalization of forensic detectors, especially across architectural boundaries (GANs vs DMs).

Method: The proposed method, TriDetect, is a semi-supervised approach using balanced cluster assignments via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and cross-view consistency to learn architectural distinctions in synthetic images.

Result: TriDetect is evaluated on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets, demonstrating superior generalization capability compared to 13 baseline methods.

Conclusion: TriDetect enhances the detection and generalization of digital media authenticity across various generator architectures, contributing to improved synthetic image forensics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generators (e.g., StyleGAN, Midjourney, DALL-E) has produced highly realistic synthetic images, posing significant challenges to digital media authenticity. These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{Tri}archy \textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the "fake" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.

### [319] [Terminal Velocity Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19797)
*Linqi Zhou,Mathias Parger,Ayaan Haque,Jiaming Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a methodology called Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM) for high-fidelity, one-step, and few-step generative modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to enhance generative modeling by improving efficiency and fidelity, particularly for one- and few-step generation processes.

Method: The authors propose TVM, a generalization of flow matching, incorporating a terminal time regularization approach and propose minimal architectural changes to stabilize training. They also develop a fused attention kernel for computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed TVM achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-256x256 and ImageNet-512x512 tasks, with significant improvements in FID scores for one- and few-function evaluations.

Conclusion: TVM provides a robust approach to generative modeling, combining both efficiency and high-quality generation. It presents an advancement in one- and few-step diffusion models.

Abstract: We propose Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM), a generalization of flow matching that enables high-fidelity one- and few-step generative modeling. TVM models the transition between any two diffusion timesteps and regularizes its behavior at its terminal time rather than at the initial time. We prove that TVM provides an upper bound on the $2$-Wasserstein distance between data and model distributions when the model is Lipschitz continuous. However, since Diffusion Transformers lack this property, we introduce minimal architectural changes that achieve stable, single-stage training. To make TVM efficient in practice, we develop a fused attention kernel that supports backward passes on Jacobian-Vector Products, which scale well with transformer architectures. On ImageNet-256x256, TVM achieves 3.29 FID with a single function evaluation (NFE) and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs. It similarly achieves 4.32 1-NFE FID and 2.94 4-NFE FID on ImageNet-512x512, representing state-of-the-art performance for one/few-step models from scratch.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for representing mental health disorders using the DSM-5, simplifying symptom analysis and improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in analyzing the complexity of mental health disorders and overcome the limitations of binary matrix representations.

Method: Development of the symptom profile generator, a structured format for representing symptom combinations and enabling automated generation of diagnostic profiles.

Result: The profile generator demonstrates improved handling of complex disorders and enables targeted manipulation for specific similarity assessments between disorders.

Conclusion: The symptom profile generator provides an efficient and adaptable alternative to binary matrix representations for analyzing complex mental health disorders, offering computational advantages and improved diagnostic pathways.

Abstract: Mental health disorders, particularly cognitive disorders defined by deficits in cognitive abilities, are described in detail in the DSM-5, which includes definitions and examples of signs and symptoms. A simplified, machine-actionable representation was developed to assess the similarity and separability of these disorders, but it is not suited for the most complex cases. Generating or applying a full binary matrix for similarity calculations is infeasible due to the vast number of symptom combinations. This research develops an alternative representation that links the narrative form of the DSM-5 with the binary matrix representation and enables automated generation of valid symptom combinations. Using a strict pre-defined format of lists, sets, and numbers with slight variations, complex diagnostic pathways involving numerous symptom combinations can be represented. This format, called the symptom profile generator (or simply generator), provides a readable, adaptable, and comprehensive alternative to a binary matrix while enabling easy generation of symptom combinations (profiles). Cognitive disorders, which typically involve multiple diagnostic criteria with several symptoms, can thus be expressed as lists of generators. Representing several psychotic disorders in generator form and generating all symptom combinations showed that matrix representations of complex disorders become too large to manage. The MPCS (maximum pairwise cosine similarity) algorithm cannot handle matrices of this size, prompting the development of a profile reduction method using targeted generator manipulation to find specific MPCS values between disorders. The generators allow easier creation of binary representations for large matrices and make it possible to calculate specific MPCS cases between complex disorders through conditional generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of calibrating low-cost air-quality sensors, which play a vital role in widespread air-quality monitoring, but are difficult to align with expensive regulatory-grade monitors.

Method: The authors proposed RESPIRE, a calibration technique that uses an outlier-resistant training algorithm and provides an explainable model to enhance cross-site, cross-season, and cross-sensor prediction accuracy.

Result: The RESPIRE method demonstrated better accuracy and reliability compared to existing methods when applied to data from multiple sites, seasons, and sensor types.

Conclusion: RESPIRE is a promising framework that streamlines LCAQ sensor calibration, enhancing their usability and effectiveness in wide-ranging air-quality monitoring networks.

Abstract: We present a case study for the calibration of Low-cost air-quality (LCAQ) CO sensors from one of the largest multi-site-multi-season-multi-sensor-multi-pollutant mobile air-quality monitoring network deployments in India. LCAQ sensors have been shown to play a critical role in the establishment of dense, expansive air-quality monitoring networks and combating elevated pollution levels. The calibration of LCAQ sensors against regulatory-grade monitors is an expensive, laborious and time-consuming process, especially when a large number of sensors are to be deployed in a geographically diverse layout. In this work, we present the RESPIRE technique to calibrate LCAQ sensors to detect ambient CO (Carbon Monoxide) levels. RESPIRE offers specific advantages over baseline calibration methods popular in literature, such as improved prediction in cross-site, cross-season, and cross-sensor settings. RESPIRE offers a training algorithm that is provably resistant to outliers and an explainable model with the ability to flag instances of model overfitting. Empirical results are presented based on data collected during an extensive deployment spanning four sites, two seasons and six sensor packages.

Motivation: Traditional vision-based material perception methods struggle under visually impaired conditions, necessitating multimodal approaches that handle challenges like noise, missing data, and task-adaptable modal importance.

Method: TouchFormer is built with a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism, intra- and inter-modality attention, and Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization (CER) for effective multimodal integration and fine-grained classification.

Result: TouchFormer improves classification accuracy by 2.48% on the SSMC task and 6.83% on the USMC task. Real-world experiments demonstrate its robustness in robotic applications.

Conclusion: TouchFormer enhances material perception, enabling robust robotic operation in safety-critical tasks, and outperforms current methods in multimodal fusion. Code, datasets, and supplementary video materials will be made available.

Abstract: Traditional vision-based material perception methods often experience substantial performance degradation under visually impaired conditions, thereby motivating the shift toward non-visual multimodal material perception. Despite this, existing approaches frequently perform naive fusion of multimodal inputs, overlooking key challenges such as modality-specific noise, missing modalities common in real-world scenarios, and the dynamically varying importance of each modality depending on the task. These limitations lead to suboptimal performance across several benchmark tasks. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal fusion framework, TouchFormer. Specifically, we employ a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism and intra- and inter-modality attention mechanisms to adaptively integrate cross-modal features, enhancing model robustness. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization(CER) strategy, which significantly improves classification accuracy in fine-grained subcategory material recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing non-visual methods, the proposed TouchFormer framework achieves classification accuracy improvements of 2.48% and 6.83% on SSMC and USMC tasks, respectively. Furthermore, real-world robotic experiments validate TouchFormer's effectiveness in enabling robots to better perceive and interpret their environment, paving the way for its deployment in safety-critical applications such as emergency response and industrial automation. The code and datasets will be open-source, and the videos are available in the supplementary materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) framework combining strengths of FL and SL methods, optimizing for faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address latency and accuracy trade-offs in distributed learning paradigms, proposing a solution to combine FL's low-latency parallel training and SL's higher accuracy sequential training.

Method: It analyzes convergence regarding learning mode and batch size interplay, formulates a delay minimization problem, and solves it using a two-stage solution comprising a block coordinate descent method and rounding algorithm.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant reduction in convergence delay compared to existing methods while maintaining target accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully accelerates hybrid learning systems, optimizing resource use and reducing delays.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are two effective distributed learning paradigms in wireless networks, enabling collaborative model training across mobile devices without sharing raw data. While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence to the target accuracy compared to existing methods.

*Bing Liu,Boao Kong,Limin Lu,Kun Yuan,Chengcheng Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes two strategies for incorporating heterogeneous node weights in decentralized learning and introduces a weighted Hilbert-space framework to evaluate and contrast their convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the fundamental differences, guarantees, and behaviors of two methods for integrating heterogeneous node weights in decentralized learning, which have heretofore been unclear in terms of convergence analysis.

Method: The authors develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(λ;\mathbb{R}^d)$ to provide tighter convergence rates and analyze the impact of self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint matrices on consensus and convergence.

Result: The row-stochastic design converges faster under certain conditions and benefits from reduced penalty terms compared to the doubly stochastic method, even when the spectral gap is smaller.

Conclusion: The paper provides topology conditions and guidelines, highlighting how the row-stochastic design can improve decentralized learning performance under specific scenarios.

Abstract: Decentralized learning often involves a weighted global loss with heterogeneous node weights $λ$. We revisit two natural strategies for incorporating these weights: (i) embedding them into the local losses to retain a uniform weight (and thus a doubly stochastic matrix), and (ii) keeping the original losses while employing a $λ$-induced row-stochastic matrix. Although prior work shows that both strategies yield the same expected descent direction for the global loss, it remains unclear whether the Euclidean-space guarantees are tight and what fundamentally differentiates their behaviors. To clarify this, we develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(λ;\mathbb{R}^d)$ and obtain convergence rates that are strictly tighter than those from Euclidean analysis. In this geometry, the row-stochastic matrix becomes self-adjoint whereas the doubly stochastic one does not, creating additional penalty terms that amplify consensus error, thereby slowing convergence. Consequently, the difference in convergence arises not only from spectral gaps but also from these penalty terms. We then derive sufficient conditions under which the row-stochastic design converges faster even with a smaller spectral gap. Finally, by using a Rayleigh-quotient and Loewner-order eigenvalue comparison, we further obtain topology conditions that guarantee this advantage and yield practical topology-design guidelines.

TL;DR: ParaBlock enhances communication efficiency in federated training of large language models by parallelizing communication and computation, achieving strong performance and the same convergence rate as standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address communication inefficiency in federated learning for large language models, particularly as federated block coordinate descent becomes challenging with large-scale blocks for resource-constrained clients.

Method: ParaBlock, a novel approach, creates two parallel threads—one for communication and another for computation—to optimize the federated block coordinate descent framework in LLMs.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that ParaBlock maintains high performance while significantly improving communication efficiency during the fine-tuning of LLMs for various tasks.

Conclusion: ParaBlock achieves notable communication efficiency improvements in federated learning without compromising convergence rates or model performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been extensively studied as a privacy-preserving training paradigm. Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning LLMs, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for communication and computation to enhance communication efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed ParaBlock achieves the same convergence rate as the standard federated block coordinate descent methods. Empirical evaluations on fine-tuning LLMs on general instruction following and mathematical reasoning confirm that ParaBlock not only maintains strong performance but also significantly improves communication efficiency.

Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in forecasting performance of existing time series models, particularly in contexts requiring long input predictions.

Method: It modifies a popular decoder-only time series model (TimesFM) by incorporating multiresolution input capability, then trains the model using over 300 billion unique data points.

Result: The model achieves superior performance on observability datasets and maintains similar performance on general-purpose benchmarks like GIFT-Eval.

Conclusion: The multiresolution structure enhances forecasting accuracy, especially for long context inputs, making this model valuable for observability applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Cisco Time Series Model, a univariate zero-shot forecaster. This time series foundation model is the result of a general architectural innovation to a time series model enabling it to accept multiresolution input, applied to a popular decoder-only time series model (TimesFM). The resulting multiresolution decoder-only model is trained on over 300B unique data points, with more than half coming from the observability domain. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the resulting model achieves superior performance on observability datasets while retaining very similar performance on a standard general-purpose forecasting benchmark (GIFT-Eval), and suggest that the multiresolution structure enables the model to make more accurate predictions on long context input.

*Adarsh Kumarappan,Ananya Mujoo*

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated pipeline to generate large-scale multi-turn conversational attack datasets based on psychological principles, evaluates LLMs, and identifies vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for improved safety measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent threat posed by multi-turn conversational attacks leveraging psychological principles like FITD, and overcome the challenge of manually scaling dataset creation.

Method: Creation of an automated pipeline to generate multi-turn jailbreak datasets using reproducible FITD templates, and benchmarking across seven LLMs under multiple conditions.

Result: Findings reveal models like GPT family are vulnerable to conversational history, Google Gemini exhibits resilience, and Anthropic Claude shows strong but imperfect defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: LLMs vary significantly in contextual robustness, and the study emphasizes the need for enhanced defense mechanisms against narrative-based manipulations.

Abstract: Multi-turn conversational attacks, which leverage psychological principles like Foot-in-the-Door (FITD), where a small initial request paves the way for a more significant one, to bypass safety alignments, pose a persistent threat to Large Language Models (LLMs). Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedEcho introduces uncertainty-aware distillation in asynchronous federated learning to tackle challenges like outdated updates and bias due to heterogeneous data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asynchronous FL faces issues such as outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the model and faster clients introducing bias, especially in heterogeneous data scenarios.

Method: FedEcho uses uncertainty-aware distillation to dynamically assess and adjust the influence of straggler client predictions based on their uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedEcho outperforms existing baselines in asynchronous federated learning, enhancing performance despite heterogeneity and delays.

Conclusion: FedEcho provides a robust solution to improve asynchronous federated learning without accessing private client data, tackling challenges of delays and heterogeneity effectively.

Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (FL) has recently gained attention for its enhanced efficiency and scalability, enabling local clients to send model updates to the server at their own pace without waiting for slower participants. However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data.

*Chaogui Kang,Lijian Luo,Qingfeng Guan,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SX-GeoTree integrates spatial dependencies and robust local explanations into decision trees, enhancing geospatial machine learning while maintaining predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address decision trees' weaknesses in capturing spatial dependencies and providing robust local explanations for geospatial machine learning tasks.

Method: The method involves SX-GeoTree, a geospatial regression tree, optimized with three coupled objectives: minimizing impurity (MSE), controlling spatial residuals via Moran's I, and maximizing explanation robustness using modularity based on geographically weighted regression and SHAP attributions.

Result: SX-GeoTree achieves comparable predictive accuracy to traditional decision trees (0.01 $R^{2}$ difference) but improves spatial residual balance and doubles explanation stability in analyses of GDP (Fujian) and housing prices (Seattle).

Conclusion: The framework embeds spatial similarity in interpretable models, advancing domain-aware explainability and trustworthy geospatial machine learning, particularly in tasks requiring spatial coherence and robust explanations.

Abstract: Decision trees remain central for tabular prediction but struggle with (i) capturing spatial dependence and (ii) producing locally stable (robust) explanations. We present SX-GeoTree, a self-explaining geospatial regression tree that integrates three coupled objectives during recursive splitting: impurity reduction (MSE), spatial residual control (global Moran's I), and explanation robustness via modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network formed from (a) geographically weighted regression (GWR) coefficient distances (stimulus-response similarity) and (b) SHAP attribution distances (explanatory similarity). We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability. The framework demonstrates how spatial similarity - extended beyond geometric proximity through GWR-derived local relationships - can be embedded in interpretable models, advancing trustworthy geospatial machine learning and offering a transferable template for domain-aware explainability.

*Peng Zhao,Yu-Hu Yan,Hang Yu,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniGrad methods to enhance universal online learning adaptivity, focusing on gradient variation for better regret bounds under different conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve universal online learning methods by addressing problem-dependent adaptivity and leveraging gradient variation for better regret bounds.

Method: Two new algorithms, UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman, are introduced alongside a meta algorithm requiring fewer gradient queries per round, supported by the UniGrad++ variant for computational efficiency.

Result: Achieves regret guarantees adaptive to gradient variation, including $
{O}(\sqrt{V_T)$ for convex functions and $
{O}(\log V_T)$ for strongly convex functions.

Conclusion: UniGrad methods represent a significant advancement in universal online learning by providing adaptive and efficient solutions to gradient variation challenges.

Abstract: Universal online learning aims to achieve optimal regret guarantees without requiring prior knowledge of the curvature of online functions. Existing methods have established minimax-optimal regret bounds for universal online learning, where a single algorithm can simultaneously attain $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for convex functions, $\mathcal{O}(d \log T)$ for exp-concave functions, and $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ for strongly convex functions, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $d$ is the dimension of the feasible domain. However, these methods still lack problem-dependent adaptivity. In particular, no universal method provides regret bounds that scale with the gradient variation $V_T$, a key quantity that plays a crucial role in applications such as stochastic optimization and fast-rate convergence in games. In this work, we introduce UniGrad, a novel approach that achieves both universality and adaptivity, with two distinct realizations: UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman. Both methods achieve universal regret guarantees that adapt to gradient variation, simultaneously attaining $\mathcal{O}(\log V_T)$ regret for strongly convex functions and $\mathcal{O}(d \log V_T)$ regret for exp-concave functions. For convex functions, the regret bounds differ: UniGrad.Correct achieves an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_T \log V_T})$ bound while preserving the RVU property that is crucial for fast convergence in online games, whereas UniGrad.Bregman achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_T})$ regret bound through a novel design. Both methods employ a meta algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ base learners, which naturally requires $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ gradient queries per round. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce UniGrad++, which retains the regret while reducing the gradient query to just $1$ per round via surrogate optimization. We further provide various implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OS2FS techniques face performance issues due to limitations in feature evaluation. The paper aims to address these challenges while handling missing data in high-dimensional streaming data.

Method: The paper proposes the ODESFS approach which combines latent factor analysis for missing data imputation with differential evolution for feature evaluation.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets show that ODESFS outperforms existing OSFS and OS2FS techniques in feature selection and accuracy.

Conclusion: ODESFS offers a significant advancement in sparse feature selection for high-dimensional streaming data, effectively addressing limitations in earlier methods and improving overall performance.

Abstract: The processing of high-dimensional streaming data commonly utilizes online streaming feature selection (OSFS) techniques. However, practical implementations often face challenges with data incompleteness due to equipment failures and technical constraints. Online Sparse Streaming Feature Selection (OS2FS) tackles this issue through latent factor analysis-based missing data imputation. Despite this advancement, existing OS2FS approaches exhibit substantial limitations in feature evaluation, resulting in performance deterioration. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a novel Online Differential Evolution for Sparse Feature Selection (ODESFS) in data streams, incorporating two key innovations: (1) missing value imputation using a latent factor analysis model, and (2) feature importance evaluation through differential evolution. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that ODESFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art OSFS and OS2FS methods by selecting optimal feature subsets and achieving superior accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build versatile, efficient multi-task systems by overcoming distribution shifts and preserving task-specific features during model fusion.

Method: Uses optimal transport plans to align semantic geometry via masked task vectors, extracting transferable components and supporting continual fusion with bounded memory.

Result: Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and efficiency for the OTMF method.

Conclusion: OTMF offers a scalable, effective framework for model merging, enabling practical and theoretically robust multi-task systems.

Abstract: Merging models fine-tuned for different tasks into a single unified model has become an increasingly important direction for building versatile, efficient multi-task systems. Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter interpolation in weight space, which we show introduces significant distribution shift in the feature space and undermines task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose OTMF (Optimal Transport-based Masked Fusion), a novel model merging framework rooted in optimal transport theory to address the distribution shift that arises from naive parameter interpolation. Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight the practical and theoretical value of our approach to model merging.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inv^2A, a method for recovering hidden prompts from outputs using the latent space of LLMs, achieving better inversion performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language model inversion (LMI) threatens user privacy and system security. The paper aims to improve methods for recovering hidden prompts while highlighting limited protection from current defenses.

Method: They propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH) which focuses on source invariance and cyclic invariance. The Inv^2A framework uses an invariant decoder with a lightweight inverse encoder trained in two stages: contrastive alignment and supervised reinforcement.

Result: Inv^2A outperforms existing methods by an average of 4.77% BLEU score across 9 datasets, demonstrating robustness while requiring less dependency on large inverse corpora.

Conclusion: This study advances LMI techniques and exposes weaknesses in current defenses, calling for improved strategies to counteract prompt inversion threats.

Abstract: Language model inversion (LMI), i.e., recovering hidden prompts from outputs, emerges as a concrete threat to user privacy and system security. We recast LMI as reusing the LLM's own latent space and propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH): (1) diverse outputs from the same source prompt should preserve consistent semantics (source invariance), and (2) input<->output cyclic mappings should be self-consistent within a shared latent space (cyclic invariance). Accordingly, we present Inv^2A, which treats the LLM as an invariant decoder and learns only a lightweight inverse encoder that maps outputs to a denoised pseudo-representation. When multiple outputs are available, they are sparsely concatenated at the representation layer to increase information density. Training proceeds in two stages: contrastive alignment (source invariance) and supervised reinforcement (cyclic invariance). An optional training-free neighborhood search can refine local performance. Across 9 datasets covering user and system prompt scenarios, Inv^2A outperforms baselines by an average of 4.77% BLEU score while reducing dependence on large inverse corpora. Our analysis further shows that prevalent defenses provide limited protection, underscoring the need for stronger strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces and analyzes active learning markets for purchasing data labels through optimization methods to improve model fitting in resource-constrained environments, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to optimize label acquisition for predictive analytics under resource constraints, addressing a gap in current research which focuses more on purchasing features and examples rather than labels.

Method: The authors formalize label acquisition as an optimization problem with budget constraints and improvement thresholds. They explore two active learning strategies (variance-based and query-by-committee) paired with distinct pricing mechanisms and compare these with a random sampling benchmark.

Result: Empirical validation on real-world datasets in real estate and energy forecasting demonstrates that the proposed strategies achieve better performance with fewer labels than conventional methods.

Conclusion: The study presents an easy-to-implement and practical approach to optimize data acquisition, particularly useful in settings with limited resources, showing superior outcomes in predictive analytics.

Abstract: We introduce and analyse active learning markets as a way to purchase labels, in situations where analysts aim to acquire additional data to improve model fitting, or to better train models for predictive analytics applications. This comes in contrast to the many proposals that already exist to purchase features and examples. By originally formalising the market clearing as an optimisation problem, we integrate budget constraints and improvement thresholds into the label acquisition process. We focus on a single-buyer-multiple-seller setup and propose the use of two active learning strategies (variance based and query-by-committee based), paired with distinct pricing mechanisms. They are compared to a benchmark random sampling approach. The proposed strategies are validated on real-world datasets from two critical application domains: real estate pricing and energy forecasting. Results demonstrate the robustness of our approach, consistently achieving superior performance with fewer labels acquired compared to conventional methods. Our proposal comprises an easy-to-implement practical solution for optimising data acquisition in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether a single agent can scale to hundreds of tasks with online RL and address limitations of single-task, offline reinforcement learning research.

Method: The method involves introducing a new benchmark with diverse tasks, language instructions, and demonstrations. The proposed model, Newt, is pretrained on demonstrations for task-aware representations and action priors, then optimized with online interaction.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Newt achieves superior multitask performance, data efficiency, and adaptation to unseen tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Newt showcases the potential of large-scale online RL agents for general-purpose control, and the release of benchmarks, environments, code, and checkpoints facilitates future research in this field.

Abstract: General-purpose control demands agents that act across many tasks and embodiments, yet research on reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control remains dominated by single-task or offline regimes, reinforcing a view that online RL does not scale. Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations. We then present \emph{Newt}, a language-conditioned multitask world model that is first pretrained on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, and then jointly optimized with online interaction across all tasks. Experiments show that Newt yields better multitask performance and data-efficiency than a set of strong baselines, exhibits strong open-loop control, and enables rapid adaptation to unseen tasks. We release our environments, demonstrations, code for training and evaluation, as well as 200+ checkpoints.

Motivation: To effectively uncover the reasoning diversity of deep neural networks, as many optimal models rely on distinct concepts or strategies but are often behaviorally similar.

Method: They combine lightweight adapter modules with a diversity-regularized training objective to train multiple accurate neural networks that follow distinct reasoning patterns.

Result: The approach produces diverse neural models with fundamentally different reasoning processes while maintaining identical predictive performance.

Conclusion: This framework systematically enables exploration of reasoning diversity in neural networks, ensuring better auditing and comparative analysis of equally accurate solutions.

Abstract: Modern neural networks rarely have a single way to be right. For many tasks, multiple models can achieve identical performance while relying on different features or reasoning patterns, a property known as the Rashomon Effect. However, uncovering this diversity in deep architectures is challenging as their continuous parameter spaces contain countless near-optimal solutions that are numerically distinct but often behaviorally similar. We introduce Rashomon Concept Bottleneck Models, a framework that learns multiple neural networks which are all accurate yet reason through distinct human-understandable concepts. By combining lightweight adapter modules with a diversity-regularized training objective, our method constructs a diverse set of deep concept-based models efficiently without retraining from scratch. The resulting networks provide fundamentally different reasoning processes for the same predictions, revealing how concept reliance and decision making vary across equally performing solutions. Our framework enables systematic exploration of data-driven reasoning diversity in deep models, offering a new mechanism for auditing, comparison, and alignment across equally accurate solutions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a forecasting method that improves results by combining a Gaussian Process for long-term trends and a denoising system for finer details, achieving better accuracy and stability across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time-series forecasting is challenging due to temporal patterns operating at different scales, often causing instability in existing neural models and unreliable results.

Method: A forecast-blur-denoise framework with a learnable Gaussian Process to model long-range structures, complemented by a refinement model to restore fine-grained details. The system is trained end-to-end.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline models in accuracy and stability across diverse datasets like electricity, traffic, and solar data.

Conclusion: This modular framework enhances forecast reliability and interpretability, supporting real-world applications in domains like energy and infrastructure.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting remains difficult in real-world settings because temporal patterns operate at multiple scales, from broad contextual trends to fast, fine-grained fluctuations that drive critical decisions. Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios. By strengthening the reliability and interpretability of fine-scale temporal predictions, this framework contributes to more trustworthy AI systems used in forecasting-driven decision support across energy, infrastructure, and other time-critical domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BlockCert, a framework for certifying blockwise extraction of mechanisms in transformer models and supports local model edits while ensuring guarantees on fidelity and behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between mechanistic interpretability and reliable model editing, providing formal guarantees on how extracted or modified models deviate from the original transformer.

Method: BlockCert extracts transformer mechanisms and certifies them with bounds on error, coverage metrics, and cryptographic hashes. A Lipschitz-based theorem formalized in Lean 4 lifts these local certificates to a global behavior bound.

Result: Applied to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B, BlockCert achieved high coverage, low residual errors, and matched baseline model perplexities while ensuring certified extraction and edits.

Conclusion: BlockCert demonstrates the feasibility of formally certifying transformer mechanisms, integrating mechanistic interpretability with formal reasoning to improve confidence in extraction and editing processes.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aspires to reverse-engineer neural networks into explicit algorithms, while model editing seeks to modify specific behaviours without retraining. Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts. Our results suggest that blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and offers a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behaviour.

Verified with industry-grade datasets, TREASURE features three key capabilities: 1) an input module with dedicated sub-modules for static and dynamic attributes, enabling more efficient training and inference; 2) an efficient and effective training paradigm for predicting high-cardinality categorical attributes; and 3) demonstrated effectiveness as both a standalone model that increases abnormal behavior detection performance by 111% over production systems and an embedding provider that enhances recommendation models by 104%. We present key insights from extensive ablation studies, benchmarks against production models, and case studies, highlighting valuable knowledge gained from developing TREASURE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TiCT, a transformer-based time series model for in-context learning, enabling classification tasks efficiently without extensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing general-purpose models for time series classification is challenging due to the high cost of acquiring labeled data, and there is a gap in achieving fine-tuning-free classification.

Method: The authors propose TiCT, a transformer model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data using a bit-based label encoding, special output attention mechanism, and a synthetic pre-training framework combining Mixup-inspired processes and data augmentation.

Result: TiCT achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods on the UCR Archive while using only in-context examples and no model weight updates at inference.

Conclusion: TiCT provides an efficient solution for time series classification tasks, demonstrating high adaptability and performance without requiring extensive labeled data or retraining.

Abstract: The ubiquity of time series data creates a strong demand for general-purpose foundation models, yet developing them for classification remains a significant challenge, largely due to the high cost of labeled data. Foundation models capable of in-context learning (ICL) offer a powerful solution, adapting to new tasks with minimal examples and reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance. Extensive evaluations on the UCR Archive show that TiCT achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods. Crucially, this is accomplished using only in-context examples at inference time, without updating a single model weight.

*Ziteng Sun,Adrian Benton,Samuel Kushnir,Asher Trockman,Vikas Singh,Suhas Diggavi,Ananda Theertha Suresh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops algorithms for quantizing large language models without calibration data, optimizing transformations and adaptive rounding. Tested on Gemma 2, it outperforms baselines by improving benchmark scores with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge addressed is the inefficiency of traditional quantization processes due to reliance on calibration data, which is often unavailable or restricted due to privacy concerns.

Method: The authors propose a novel method that uses a proxy function to optimize quantization loss without calibration data. Structured matrix transformations and dual matrix transformations with adaptive rounding ensure efficient inference.

Result: The method consistently improves performance in experiments on Gemma 2 models, surpassing baseline approaches. For example, the 3-bit quantization benchmark score improved significantly from 52.0 to 60.6.

Conclusion: Quantization of large language models can be achieved effectively without calibration data. This approach ensures performance improvements and matches GPTQ methods, with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Post-training quantization is an effective method for reducing the serving cost of large language models, where the standard approach is to use a round-to-nearest quantization level scheme. However, this often introduces large errors due to outliers in the weights. Proposed mitigation mechanisms include applying adaptive rounding, random rotation transformations or committing to a post-training target using calibration data. Unfortunately, this reliance on calibration data can be severely limiting in some real-world scenarios as such data may be unavailable or subject to privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose algorithms to optimize transformations and adaptive rounding without access to any calibration data. The optimization is achieved by designing a suitable proxy function for the quantization loss without calibration data. To maintain inference efficiency, we perform structured matrix transformations for single matrices. For paired weights that interact directly in the computation graph, we use dual matrix transformations and adaptive rounding methods. We conduct experiments on Gemma 2 models, and observe consistent improvement over the baselines. For Gemma 2 9B quantization, our method improves the average benchmark score from 61.9 to 62.4 for 4-bit quantization and from 52.0 to 60.6 for 3-bit quantization, while adding less than 3% of computation overhead. Furthermore, our method achieves performance comparable to the commonly used GPTQ method, which requires calibration data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes an LLM-based active learning (LLM-AL) framework that outperforms traditional machine learning models in reducing experimental efforts by over 70% across materials science datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional active learning models, such as cold-start issues and restricted generalizability due to domain-specific feature engineering, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

Method: The study introduced LLM-AL, a framework operating in an iterative few-shot context, tested on four materials science datasets with two prompting strategies: numerical inputs for structured features and expanded text for experimental/procedural features.

Result: LLM-AL reduced the experiments needed by over 70%, outperformed traditional ML models across all datasets, maintained search efficacy, and exhibited consistent performance despite LLM non-determinism.

Conclusion: LLM-AL offers a generalizable, efficient, and interpretable alternative to traditional active learning, opening up possibilities for LLM-driven autonomous scientific discovery.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) accelerates scientific discovery by prioritizing the most informative experiments, but traditional machine learning (ML) models used in AL suffer from cold-start limitations and domain-specific feature engineering, restricting their generalizability. Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data privacy, intellectual property, and legal constraints limit sharing, creating accessibility and accuracy biases in predictive models.

Method: A web-based application designed to train models locally in the browser, allowing non-technical usage and cross-platform integration, with a modular design offering multiple approaches.

Result: DISCO facilitates collaborative training with options for federated or decentralized paradigms, privacy guarantees, model personalization, and bias resilience.

Conclusion: DISCO empowers users to collaboratively build machine learning models while safeguarding data privacy and ensuring accessibility.

Abstract: Data is often impractical to share for a range of well considered reasons, such as concerns over privacy, intellectual property, and legal constraints.

### [345] [Scalable Data Attribution via Forward-Only Test-Time Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19803)
*Sibo Ma,Julian Nyarko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable method for data attribution in large models by shifting computation from inference to training simulation, reducing inference cost significantly compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impracticality of classical influence-function methods in modern networks, enabling scalable debugging, auditing, and data valuation for large models.

Method: Simulates the parameter influence of each training example using short-horizon gradient propagation during training, then retrieves attributions using forward evaluations at inference.

Result: The proposed method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on attribution metrics like LOO and LDS with significantly reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: This method provides a practical framework for real-time data attribution in large pretrained models, balancing scalability and theoretical integrity.

Abstract: Data attribution seeks to trace model behavior back to the training examples that shaped it, enabling debugging, auditing, and data valuation at scale. Classical influence-function methods offer a principled foundation but remain impractical for modern networks because they require expensive backpropagation or Hessian inversion at inference. We propose a data attribution method that preserves the same first-order counterfactual target while eliminating per-query backward passes. Our approach simulates each training example's parameter influence through short-horizon gradient propagation during training and later reads out attributions for any query using only forward evaluations. This design shifts computation from inference to simulation, reflecting real deployment regimes where a model may serve billions of user queries but originate from a fixed, finite set of data sources (for example, a large language model trained on diverse corpora while compensating a specific publisher such as the New York Times). Empirically, on standard MLP benchmarks, our estimator matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines such as TRAK on standard attribution metrics (LOO and LDS) while offering orders-of-magnitude lower inference cost. By combining influence-function fidelity with first-order scalability, our method provides a theoretical framework for practical, real-time data attribution in large pretrained models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EfficientXpert is proposed as a lightweight domain-pruning framework for large language models (LLMs), retaining up to 98% performance with 40% sparsity in health and legal domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient, domain-specialized large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments since current methods either generalize poorly across domains or entail high overhead.

Method: EfficientXpert employs a propagation-aware pruning criterion (Foresight Mask) and an efficient adapter-update algorithm (Partial Brain Surgeon), integrated into the LoRA fine-tuning process to create sparse, domain-adapted models.

Result: EfficientXpert achieves 98% of dense model performance at 40% sparsity and surpasses state-of-the-art methods. It also reveals structural shifts across domains requiring adaptive pruning strategies.

Conclusion: EfficientXpert offers a one-step, domain-aware pruning solution for compressing and adapting language models effectively, highlighting the importance of domain-specific approaches.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has increased the demand for domain-specialized variants in areas such as law, healthcare, and finance. However, their large size remains a barrier to deployment in resource-constrained environments, and existing compression methods either generalize poorly across domains or incur high overhead. In this work, we propose \textbf{EfficientXpert}, a lightweight domain-pruning framework that combines a propagation-aware pruning criterion (Foresight Mask) with an efficient adapter-update algorithm (Partial Brain Surgeon). Integrated into the LoRA fine-tuning process, EfficientXpert enables a one-step transformation of general pretrained models into sparse, domain-adapted experts. Across health and legal tasks, it retains up to 98% of dense-model performance at 40% sparsity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis reveals substantial domain-dependent structural shifts that degrade the effectiveness of general pruning masks, underscoring the need for adaptive, domain-aware pruning strategies tailored to each domain.

*Marzi Heidari,Hanping Zhang,Yuhong Guo*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework using reinforcement learning to address noisy label correction in machine learning, achieving superior results compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy labels in datasets can significantly hinder the performance of prediction models, necessitating effective correction mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces RLNLC, which frames noisy label correction as a reinforcement learning problem using a policy network based on deep feature representation and an actor-critic method.

Result: RLNLC demonstrates effectiveness and superior performance through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: RLNLC provides a robust approach to noisy label correction, improving prediction model training and advancing the state-of-the-art methods in this area.

Abstract: The challenge of learning with noisy labels is significant in machine learning, as it can severely degrade the performance of prediction models if not addressed properly. This paper introduces a novel framework that conceptualizes noisy label correction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. The proposed approach, Reinforcement Learning for Noisy Label Correction (RLNLC), defines a comprehensive state space representing data and their associated labels, an action space that indicates possible label corrections, and a reward mechanism that evaluates the efficacy of label corrections. RLNLC learns a deep feature representation based policy network to perform label correction through reinforcement learning, utilizing an actor-critic method. The learned policy is subsequently deployed to iteratively correct noisy training labels and facilitate the training of the prediction model. The effectiveness of RLNLC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques for learning with noisy labels.

### [348] [The Devil in the Details: Emergent Misalignment, Format and Coherence in Open-Weights LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20104)
*Craig Dickson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how fine-tuning open-weight models leads to emergent misalignment and finds such models less prone to misalignment than proprietary systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether current-generation open-weight models demonstrate a resistance to emergent misalignment as seen in prior studies, particularly comparing them to proprietary systems like GPT-4o.

Method: The authors test nine open-weight models of various scales (1B-32B parameters), fine-tuning them on insecure code generation tasks, and compare misalignment rates under different output formats (natural language vs JSON).

Result: Open-weight models exhibited lower misalignment rates (0.07%-0.68%) compared to GPT-4o's 20%. However, requiring structured outputs like JSON significantly increased misalignment vulnerability.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment is reproducible in open-weight models, but they are significantly less prone to it compared to proprietary systems like GPT-4o. Additionally, output constraints, such as JSON, exacerbate misalignment risks.

Abstract: Prior work has shown that fine-tuning models on a narrow domain with misaligned data can lead to broad misalignment - a phenomenon termed "emergent misalignment" (Betley et al. 2025). While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.
  We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.
  We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse. These findings confirm emergent misalignment as a reproducible phenomenon in modern open-weights models, with rates substantially lower than observed in proprietary systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have scalability advantages but suffer from high memory overheads. Mosaic Pruning (MoP) addresses this issue by clustering and selecting experts to maintain functional robustness across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the static memory overhead and domain-specific performance degradation in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) LLMs caused by existing pruning methods.

Method: Mosaic Pruning (MoP) introduces a structured cluster-then-select process using a similarity metric and Activation Variability Score to create a functionally diverse set of experts for LLMs.

Result: MoP achieves significant performance improvements, with a 7.24% gain on general tasks and an 8.92% gain on specialized tasks like math reasoning and code generation.

Conclusion: Mosaic Pruning effectively reduces the static memory overhead of SMoE LLMs while retaining robust, functional performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have enabled a new frontier in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs), offering superior performance by activating only a fraction of their total parameters during inference. However, their practical deployment is severely hampered by substantial static memory overhead, as all experts must be loaded into memory. Existing post-training pruning methods, while reducing model size, often derive their pruning criteria from a single, general-purpose corpus. This leads to a critical limitation: a catastrophic performance degradation when the pruned model is applied to other domains, necessitating a costly re-pruning for each new domain. To address this generalization gap, we introduce Mosaic Pruning (MoP). The core idea of MoP is to construct a functionally comprehensive set of experts through a structured ``cluster-then-select" process. This process leverages a similarity metric that captures expert performance across different task domains to functionally cluster the experts, and subsequently selects the most representative expert from each cluster based on our proposed Activation Variability Score. Unlike methods that optimize for a single corpus, our proposed Mosaic Pruning ensures that the pruned model retains a functionally complementary set of experts, much like the tiles of a mosaic that together form a complete picture of the original model's capabilities, enabling it to handle diverse downstream tasks.Extensive experiments on various MoE models demonstrate the superiority of our approach. MoP significantly outperforms prior work, achieving a 7.24\% gain on general tasks and 8.92\% on specialized tasks like math reasoning and code generation.

*Areeb Ahmad,Abhinav Joshi,Ashutosh Modi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer models are more structured and compositional in their internal computations than previously thought. This work shows that computations in attention heads and MLPs are distributed in orthogonal directions, revealing substructures within components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a deeper and more granular understanding of the internal computations of transformer-based language models, going beyond the typical view of treating components as single functional units.

Method: This paper decomposes attention heads and MLPs into orthogonal singular directions, identifying overlapping subfunctions and compact subspaces of meaningful computations in standard tasks like IOI, GP, and GT.

Result: The study shows that transformer components execute distributed, structured, and overlapping computations along specific low-rank directions, revealing novel substructures. Canonical functions like name mover heads demonstrate multiple subfunctions encoded in distinct directions.

Conclusion: Transformer computations are more distributed and compositional, not confined to simplistic, indivisible functions. This perspective enables fine-grained interpretability and paves the path for better understanding of internal model operations.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit complex and distributed behavior, yet their internal computations remain poorly understood. Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a transformer architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed. This perspective opens new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability and a deeper understanding of model internals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GCGSim, a new framework for graph similarity learning that addresses limitations in prior GNN-based methods by focusing on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Graph Edit Distance computation fail to account for global structural alignment and often attribute mismatched edit costs due to node-level signals, leading to inaccurate graph similarity measurements.

Method: The authors propose GCGSim, which incorporates three main technical contributions for graph-level matching and substructure-level edit cost learning to ensure GED-consistent graph similarity computation.

Result: GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy in capturing graph similarity.

Conclusion: Comprehensive analyses confirm that GCGSim learns meaningful substructure representations and resolves issues inherent in prior approaches.

Abstract: Graph Similarity Computation (GSC) is a fundamental graph related task where Graph Edit Distance (GED) serves as a prevalent metric. GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our comprehensive analyses further validate that the framework effectively learns disentangled and semantically meaningful substructure representations.

TL;DR: This paper explores how internal representations in Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve geometrically during decision-making, specifically studying the intrinsic dimension in a multiple-choice question answering setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to understand the internal decision-making processes in LLMs by studying the geometry of their hidden representations and how these influence generalization and reasoning.

Method: The researchers conducted an extensive study on 28 open-weight transformer models, analyzing intrinsic dimensions across layers using multiple estimators and linking them to performance in multiple-choice question answering tasks.

Result: The study finds a consistent pattern across LLMs: early layers operate in low-dimensional spaces, middle layers expand these, and later layers compress them back to task-relevant low-dimensional structures.

Conclusion: LLMs implicitly learn to align linguistic inputs with structured low-dimensional manifolds, enhancing their task-specific decisions and providing new insights into their generalization and reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong generalization across diverse tasks, yet the internal decision-making processes behind their predictions remain opaque. In this work, we study the geometry of hidden representations in LLMs through the lens of \textit{intrinsic dimension} (ID), focusing specifically on decision-making dynamics in a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) setting. We perform a large-scale study, with 28 open-weight transformer models and estimate ID across layers using multiple estimators, while also quantifying per-layer performance on MCQA tasks. Our findings reveal a consistent ID pattern across models: early layers operate on low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand this space, and later layers compress it again, converging to decision-relevant representations. Together, these results suggest LLMs implicitly learn to project linguistic inputs onto structured, low-dimensional manifolds aligned with task-specific decisions, providing new geometric insights into how generalization and reasoning emerge in language models.

TL;DR: SAPO introduces a smooth, adaptive optimization strategy for reinforcement learning in LLMs, outperforming existing methods like GSPO and GRPO in terms of stability, sample efficiency, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite reinforcement learning's potential to enhance LLM reasoning, unstable and suboptimal policy optimization remains a key challenge, especially in Mixture-of-Experts models.

Method: The proposed SAPO utilizes a soft, temperature-controlled gating mechanism to replace hard clipping, creating a continuous trust region. This mechanism adaptively down-weights off-policy tokens without suppressing useful learning signals.

Result: Empirical results show SAPO improves training stability and achieves higher Pass@1 performance in mathematical reasoning benchmarks under comparable training budgets. It also shows consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and model sizes.

Conclusion: SAPO provides a more reliable, effective, and scalable optimization strategy, advancing reinforcement learning for LLMs by addressing limitations of previous methods and improving both sample efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet stable and performant policy optimization remains challenging. Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper develops a Transformer-based survival analysis framework for modeling ride-hailing drivers' idle behavior, achieving superior accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting ride-hailing drivers' idle behavior can improve retention strategies and provide actionable insights for platform management.

Method: The study introduces the Frailty-Aware Cox Transformer (FACT), leveraging causal masking and driver-specific embeddings within a Transformer framework to capture drivers' heterogeneous and temporal behavior.

Result: Experiments on ride-hailing data from Toronto show that FACT outperforms traditional and deep learning survival analysis models in accuracy metrics like time-dependent C-indices and Brier Scores.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances risk estimation, supports retention strategies for ride-hailing platforms, and offers potential policy insights into driver behavior.

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms are characterized by high-frequency, behavior-driven environments. Although survival analysis has been applied to recurrent events in other domains, its use in modeling ride-hailing driver behavior remains largely unexplored. This study formulates idle behavior as a recurrent survival process using large-scale platform data and proposes a Transformer-based framework that captures long-term temporal dependencies with causal masking and incorporates driver-specific embeddings to model latent heterogeneity. Results on Toronto ride-hailing data demonstrate that the proposed Frailty-Aware Cox Transformer (FACT) achieves the highest time-dependent C-indices and lowest Brier Scores, outperforming classical and deep learning survival models. This approach enables more accurate risk estimation, supports platform retention strategies, and provides policy-relevant insights.

Result: The optimized flip-angle schedule exhibited non-periodic patterns, improving separability of fingerprints and suggesting a possibility to reduce repetition time.

Conclusion: RL can effectively enhance fingerprint separability and potentially speed up MRF acquisitions, showcasing its ability to optimize complex sequential parameters.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) leverages transient-state signal dynamics generated by the tunable acquisition parameters, making the design of an optimal, robust sequence a complex, high-dimensional sequential decision problem, such as optimizing one of the key parameters, flip angle. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to automate parameter selection, to optimize pulse sequences that maximize the distinguishability of fingerprints across the parameter space. In this work, we introduce an RL framework for optimizing the flip-angle schedule in MRF and demonstrate a learned schedule exhibiting non-periodic patterns that enhances fingerprint separability. Additionally, an interesting observation is that the RL-optimized schedule may enable a reduction in the number of repetition time, potentially accelerate MRF acquisitions.

### [356] [Differential Smoothing Mitigates Sharpening and Improves LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19942)
*Jingchu Gai,Guanning Zeng,Huaqing Zhang,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of diversity collapse during reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning in large language models by introducing a theoretical framework and proposing a novel method called differential smoothing. This method improves diversity and correctness in outputs and outperforms previous heuristics and approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issue of diversity collapse in RL fine-tuning reduces the variety and quality of generated outputs, negatively impacting effectiveness across tasks. Existing heuristics for tackling this issue are inconsistent and often make trade-offs between diversity and correctness.

Method: The authors provide a formal proof of how RL fine-tuning leads to diversity collapse due to selection and reinforcement bias. They design a method called differential smoothing, which modifies rewards selectively to maintain correctness and diversity. This method offers a theoretically principled improvement over other approaches.

Result: Differential smoothing outperforms traditional RL fine-tuning and entropy-based heuristics in both diversity and correctness. Experimental results across multiple domains, including mathematical reasoning tasks, show consistent gains with improvements of up to 6.7% on the AIME24 dataset.

Conclusion: This study rigorously analyzes and provides theoretical insights into diversity collapse in RL fine-tuning, presenting differential smoothing as a superior solution. The method is both practical and universally applicable, achieving significant improvements in key metrics.

Abstract: It is widely recognized that reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models often leads to \textit{diversity collapse}, where outputs lack variety. Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- \textit{differential smoothing} -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics. Our theory precisely characterizes when existing heuristics help and why they fail, while showing that differential smoothing is universally superior. Extensive experiments with models from 1B to 7B parameters, across domains including CountDown and real-world mathematical reasoning, demonstrate consistent gains. Differential smoothing improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k, with up to 6.7\% improvements on AIME24 dataset.

*Haoran Hu,Junren Shi,Shuo Jiang,Kun Cheng,Xia Yang,Changhao Piao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Forward Collision Warning framework using a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network and Dynamic Risk Threshold Adjustment to improve prediction accuracy, reliability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges such as computational complexity, inadequate multi-agent interaction modeling, and high false alarm rates in collision warnings.

Method: The framework integrates HSTAN (spatial and temporal modeling using GAT and cascaded GRU with self-attention) and DTRA (adaptive threshold mechanism) supported by Conformalized Quantile Regression.

Result: The system achieves significant efficiency, reliable prediction intervals, and performs well across various test scenarios with an F1 score of 0.912, 8.2% false alarm rate, and 2.8s warning lead time.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, efficient, and practically deployable solution for Forward Collision Warning systems in complex environments.

Abstract: Forward Collision Warning systems are crucial for vehicle safety and autonomous driving, yet current methods often fail to balance precise multi-agent interaction modeling with real-time decision adaptability, evidenced by the high computational cost for edge deployment and the unreliability stemming from simplified interaction models.To overcome these dual challenges-computational complexity and modeling insufficiency-along with the high false alarm rates of traditional static-threshold warnings, this paper introduces an integrated FCW framework that pairs a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with a Dynamic Risk Threshold Adjustment algorithm. HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments.

*Meiyu Zhong,Noel Teku,Ravi Tandon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study addresses the issue of prompt fairness in LLM outputs, quantifying bias through information-theoretic metrics and presenting interventions like majority voting and prompt neutralization to improve fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt phrasing often causes bias and variability in LLM responses across different subgroups, leading to unfair treatment in practical applications.

Method: Information-theoretic metrics evaluate subgroup sensitivity and cross-group consistency, followed by interventions like majority voting and prompt neutralization to reduce bias.

Result: Bias disparities were measured, showing high variability across subgroups. Mitigation strategies significantly reduced divergence, improving fairness and stability in responses.

Conclusion: Structural inequities in LLM outputs can be mitigated through practical strategies, leading to fairer and more consistent outcomes across user demographics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), though shown to be effective in many applications, can vary significantly in their response quality. In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range. After applying our neutralization and multi generation strategy, these divergences consistently decrease, with the largest gap reduced to 0.22 and many distances falling to 0.17 or below, indicating more stable and consistent outputs across subgroups.

*Songbo Wang,Renchi Yang,Yurui Lai,Xiaoyang Lin,Tsz Nam Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents NCGC, a novel framework integrating self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised node classification to effectively utilize community structures within graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the capacity of GNNs for semi-supervised node classification by leveraging tightly-knit graph communities which are unexplored in previous methods.

Method: NCGC unifies spectral graph clustering and GNN optimization, incorporates Soft Orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) with a refined message passing paradigm, and employs a multi-task objective combining classification loss and self-supervised clustering loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven real-world graphs show that NCGC consistently outperforms existing GNN models and recent baselines for semi-supervised node classification.

Conclusion: The integration of clustering and node classification via NCGC enhances model effectiveness and leverages graph communities, offering a significant improvement in performance on various datasets.

Abstract: The emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs) has offered a powerful tool for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Subsequent studies have achieved further improvements through refining the message passing schemes in GNN models or exploiting various data augmentation techniques to mitigate limited supervision. In real graphs, nodes often tend to form tightly-knit communities/clusters, which embody abundant signals for compensating label scarcity in semi-supervised node classification but are not explored in prior methods.
  Inspired by this, this paper presents NCGC that integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework. Firstly, we theoretically unify the optimization objectives of GNNs and spectral graph clustering, and based on that, develop soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) that leverage a refined message passing paradigm to generate node representations for both classification and clustering. On top of that, NCGC includes a self-supervised graph clustering module that enables the training of SOGNs for learning representations of unlabeled nodes in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, this component comprises two non-trivial clustering objectives and a Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization that transforms predicted cluster assignments into balanced soft pseudo-labels. Through combining the foregoing clustering module with the classification model using a multi-task objective containing the supervised classification loss on labeled data and self-supervised clustering loss on unlabeled data, NCGC promotes synergy between them and achieves enhanced model capacity. Our extensive experiments showcase that the proposed NCGC framework consistently and considerably outperforms popular GNN models and recent baselines for semi-supervised node classification on seven real graphs, when working with various classic GNN backbones.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHONKNORIS, a neural operator learning method grounded in numerical analysis, achieving machine-precision accuracy for solving nonlinear PDE problems. Additionally, it introduces FONKNORIS, a foundation model for broader application to unseen PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operator learning methods struggle to surpass simpler models in accuracy despite increased complexity. The study aims to address this limitation and improve precision for infinite-dimensional operator approximation.

Method: CHONKNORIS leverages Newton-type methods and regresses Cholesky factors of elliptic operators using a Tikhonov-regularized approach. FONKNORIS aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS models for diverse PDEs.

Result: CHONKNORIS achieves machine-precision accuracy and successfully benchmarks across a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems. FONKNORIS can accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs.

Conclusion: CHONKNORIS establishes high accuracy for nonlinear PDE resolution with theoretical guarantees, while FONKNORIS demonstrates the generalization for handling unseen PDEs with pre-trained expertise.

Abstract: Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional MPNNs, including issues like over-smoothing and over-correlation during message passing on graph-structured data.

Method: The DDSM model utilizes stress majorization, orthogonal regularization, and diffusion distances for guiding message passing operations, along with efficient algorithms for distance approximation.

Result: DDSM significantly outperforms 15 baseline models across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrating robust and consistent performance.

Conclusion: DDSM provides an improved framework for MPNNs by mitigating common issues and achieving superior results across various graph types.

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have emerged as go-to models for learning on graph-structured data in the past decade. Despite their effectiveness, most of such models still incur severe issues such as over-smoothing and -correlation, due to their underlying objective of minimizing the Dirichlet energy and the derived neighborhood aggregation operations. In this paper, we propose the DDSM, a new MPNN model built on an optimization framework that includes the stress majorization and orthogonal regularization for overcoming the above issues. Further, we introduce the diffusion distances for nodes into the framework to guide the new message passing operations and develop efficient algorithms for distance approximations, both backed by rigorous theoretical analyses. Our comprehensive experiments showcase that DDSM consistently and considerably outperforms 15 strong baselines on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sparsity framework for multi-tasking on resource-constrained platforms that minimizes task switching costs by maximizing parameter reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparsity methods optimize for individual tasks without considering the I/O overhead from frequent task switching, creating inefficiency in real-world multi-tasking scenarios.

Method: The method implements a framework that decomposes weights into reusable block units, aligns sparse structures across tasks, and dynamically loads only the blocks needed for the next task to improve switching efficiency.

Result: The framework significantly reduces task switching latency, achieving over 6.6X faster task switching compared to existing methods, demonstrated through experiments on an autonomous driving platform.

Conclusion: The proposed on-demand multi-task sparsity framework significantly mitigates the latency inherent in traditional methods, providing an efficient solution for multi-tasking on edge platforms.

Abstract: Sparsity is essential for deploying large models on resource constrained edge platforms. However, optimizing sparsity patterns for individual tasks in isolation ignores the significant I/O overhead incurred during frequent task switching. We introduce an on-demand multi-task sparsity framework specifically designed to minimize switching costs by maximizing parameter reuse. Unlike monolithic approaches, we decompose weights into reusable block-granular units and align sparse structures across tasks to maximize overlap. By dynamically loading only the small differential set of blocks required for the next task, our method effectively mitigates the cold-start latency inherent in traditional monolithic approaches.Experiments on a real-world autonomous driving platform demonstrate that our framework achieves superior switching efficiency, accelerating task switching by over 6.6X on average compared to existing sparsity methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RankOOD is an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection framework using the Plackett-Luce loss to achieve high accuracy on benchmarks like TinyImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve OOD detection accuracy by leveraging rank-based learning methods instead of traditional loss functions.

Method: The framework trains an initial classifier to produce rank lists for each class, then uses the Plackett-Luce loss to formalize rankings for OOD detection.

Result: RankOOD reduces FPR95 metric by 4.3% and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the TinyImageNet benchmark.

Conclusion: RankOOD offers a novel, rank-based approach to OOD detection, improving reliability and accuracy in foundational models.

Abstract: We propose RankOOD, a rank-based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection approach based on training a model with the Placket-Luce loss, which is now extensively used for preference alignment tasks in foundational models. Our approach is based on the insight that with a deep learning model trained using the Cross Entropy Loss, in-distribution (ID) class prediction induces a ranking pattern for each ID class prediction. The RankOOD framework formalizes the insight by first extracting a rank list for each class using an initial classifier and then uses another round of training with the Plackett-Luce loss, where the class rank, a fixed permutation for each class, is the predicted variable. An OOD example may get assigned with high probability to an ID example, but the probability of it respecting the ranking classification is likely to be small. RankOOD, achieves SOTA performance on the near-ODD TinyImageNet evaluation benchmark, reducing FPR95 by 4.3%.

*Nikit Phadke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces REWA, a theory of similarity based on witness-overlap structures, enabling compact encoding with ranking preservation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified, modular, and provable method for similarity systems based on witness-overlap structures, with broad applications across various domains.

Method: REWA constructs finite witness sets, assigns semi-random bits, and ensures monotonic similarity correlation with witness overlaps; proving ranking preservation under overlap-gap condition using compact encoding with logarithmic complexity.

Result: The proposed theory unifies existing systems such as Bloom filters, minhash, and random projections, demonstrating modular and compositional designs for similarity definitions.

Conclusion: REWA offers a foundational framework for similarity systems, enabling efficient and provable encoding across a vast design space, with potential for future enhancements.

Abstract: REWA introduces a general theory of similarity based on witness-overlap structures. We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $Δ(u, v) = |W(u) \cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\log(|V|/δ))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering. This manuscript presents the axioms, the main reducibility theorem, complete proofs with explicit constants, and a detailed discussion of compositional design, limitations, and future extensions including multi-bit encodings, weighted witnesses, and non-set representations.

Motivation: The study aims to explore whether time-series foundation models can effectively forecast Leaf Area Index (LAI) without task-specific tuning, especially in agricultural monitoring.

Method: The researchers compare statistical baselines, a supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model using the HiQ dataset (2000-2022) under multiple evaluation protocols.

Result: The Sundial foundation model, in zero-shot mode, outperforms a fully-trained LSTM given a sufficiently long input context window covering one or more seasonal cycles.

Conclusion: Pretrained time-series foundation models, such as Sundial, are effective plug-and-play tools for forecasting in agricultural and environmental applications, surpassing traditional supervised models.

Abstract: This work investigates the zero-shot forecasting capability of time-series foundation models for Leaf Area Index (LAI) forecasting in agricultural monitoring. Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces iRadioDiff, a diffusion-based framework for creating accurate indoor radio maps (RMs), overcoming challenges in previous methods involving EM solvers and sparse measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve indoor radio map construction, addressing inefficiencies in electromagnetic solvers and limitations of conventional learning-based approaches that fail to adequately represent heterogeneous, multipath indoor environments.

Method: The method involves a sampling-free diffusion framework conditioned on access point positions and physics-informed prompts, incorporating multipath-critical priors to model nonstationary field discontinuities efficiently.

Result: iRadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in constructing indoor radio maps and localization, demonstrating strong generalization across different layouts and materials.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively constructs high-fidelity radio maps for indoor environments, enabling accurate and environment-aware electromagnetic representation without relying on costly or sparse measurements.

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as environment-aware electromagnetic (EM) representations that connect scenario geometry and material properties to the spatial distribution of signal strength, enabling localization without costly in-situ measurements. However, constructing high-fidelity indoor RMs remains challenging due to the prohibitive latency of EM solvers and the limitations of learning-based methods, which often rely on sparse measurements or assumptions of homogeneous material, which are misaligned with the heterogeneous and multipath-rich nature of indoor environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose iRadioDiff, a sampling-free diffusion-based framework for indoor RM construction. iRadioDiff is conditioned on access point (AP) positions, and physics-informed prompt encoded by material reflection and transmission coefficients. It further incorporates multipath-critical priors, including diffraction points, strong transmission boundaries, and line-of-sight (LoS) contours, to guide the generative process via conditional channels and boundary-weighted objectives. This design enables accurate modeling of nonstationary field discontinuities and efficient construction of physically consistent RMs. Experiments demonstrate that iRadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor RM construction and received signal strength based indoor localization, which offers effective generalization across layouts and material configurations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual Graph Filtering (DGF), a novel clustering method designed for multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs), addressing limitations of existing approaches by employing denoising and contrastive learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering methods fail to handle unique characteristics such as low modality-wise correlation and high feature-noise in multimodal attributed graphs, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: The proposed Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) integrates feature-wise denoising for node representation and employs a tri-cross contrastive training strategy across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities.

Result: Experiments across eight benchmark MMAG datasets demonstrate that DGF consistently and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in clustering quality.

Conclusion: Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) enhances clustering in complex multimodal attributed graphs by effectively handling inherent challenges like feature noise and inter-modality discordance.

Abstract: Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs) are an expressive data model for representing the complex interconnections among entities that associate attributes from multiple data modalities (text, images, etc.). Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.
  Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations. Our comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark MMAG datasets exhibit that DGF is able to outperform a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of proactive anomaly prediction in multivariate time series by proposing RED-F, a framework that amplifies subtle anomaly precursors using a novel reconstruction-elimination approach and contrastive forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve anomaly prediction in multivariate time series by overcoming limitations of current unsupervised methods, which fail to detect subtle anomaly precursors due to their propensity to reconstruct normal patterns.

Method: The authors propose RED-F, consisting of a Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) for purifying normal patterns and a Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM) that utilizes both the purified and original sequences to amplify anomaly precursors through contrastive forecasting and a Multi-Series Prediction objective.

Result: RED-F demonstrated superior performance in anomaly prediction tasks across six real-world datasets by effectively detecting subtle anomaly signals.

Conclusion: The RED-F framework successfully enhances the sensitivity and robustness of anomaly prediction, showcasing its potential for critical system dependability improvements in multivariate time series analysis.

Abstract: The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in multivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting framework, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future context to enhance its predictive sensitivity. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of improving exploration efficiency in reinforcement learning when system dynamics are unknown, especially in online learning scenarios.

Method: The proposed method, SOMBRL, incorporates an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and optimistically pursues rewards by combining extrinsic rewards and epistemic uncertainty. It is adaptable to various policy optimization strategies and ensures sublinear regret under standard assumptions on system dynamics.

Result: SOMBRL demonstrates strong performance in diverse simulation scenarios, including visual-control tasks and a dynamic RC car hardware setting, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SOMBRL provides a scalable, flexible, and principled solution for exploration in model-based RL, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical success.

Abstract: We address the challenge of efficient exploration in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where the system dynamics are unknown and the RL agent must learn directly from online interactions. We propose Scalable and Optimistic MBRL (SOMBRL), an approach based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. SOMBRL learns an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and greedily maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and the agent's epistemic uncertainty. SOMBRL is compatible with any policy optimizers or planners, and under common regularity assumptions on the system, we show that SOMBRL has sublinear regret for nonlinear dynamics in the (i) finite-horizon, (ii) discounted infinite-horizon, and (iii) non-episodic settings. Additionally, SOMBRL offers a flexible and scalable solution for principled exploration. We evaluate SOMBRL on state-based and visual-control environments, where it displays strong performance across all tasks and baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bitcoin's realized volatility is influenced by a diverse array of factors, requiring advanced methods for accurate forecasting. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of machine learning models, specifically LGBM, in handling these complexities and improving prediction.

Method: The study uses the LGBM model for both deterministic and probabilistic volatility forecasting, leveraging 69 predictors from market, behavioral, and macroeconomic domains. Additionally, it adopts gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques to reveal key volatility drivers.

Result: LGBM models outperform econometric and other machine learning baselines in forecasting Bitcoin volatility. Two probabilistic approaches also provide robust predictive distributions, and key predictors like trading volume and lagged volatility measures emerge.

Conclusion: LGBM models are effective tools for capturing non-linear, high-variance behaviors in cryptocurrency markets and offer interpretable insights into factors driving Bitcoin's volatility.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting of Bitcoin realized volatility. Utilizing a comprehensive set of 69 predictors -- encompassing market, behavioral, and macroeconomic indicators -- we evaluate the performance of LGBM-based models and compare them with both econometric and machine learning baselines. For probabilistic forecasting, we explore two quantile-based approaches: direct quantile regression using the pinball loss function, and a residual simulation method that transforms point forecasts into predictive distributions. To identify the main drivers of volatility, we employ gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques, consistently highlighting the significance of trading volume, lagged volatility measures, investor attention, and market capitalization. The results demonstrate that LGBM models effectively capture the nonlinear and high-variance characteristics of cryptocurrency markets while providing interpretable insights into the underlying volatility dynamics.

TL;DR: ClimateAgent is a framework designed for automating climate data workflows, achieving high performance on a new benchmark with its multi-agent and API-aware framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacy of generic tools and static pipelines in handling the complexity and specificity of climate data analytics.

Method: ClimateAgent uses a multi-agent orchestration system, dividing tasks into subtasks managed by specialized agents like Orchestrate-Agent, Plan-Agent, Data-Agent, and Coding-Agent, ensuring dynamic, flexible responses.

Result: On the Climate-Agent-Bench-85 benchmark, ClimateAgent achieved 100% task completion and an 8.32 quality score, surpassing competitors like GitHub Copilot and GPT-5.

Conclusion: The multi-agent, self-correcting approach of the ClimateAgent framework provides substantial automation advancements in climate science workflows, demonstrating high reliability and performance.

Abstract: Climate science demands automated workflows to transform comprehensive questions into data-driven statements across massive, heterogeneous datasets. However, generic LLM agents and static scripting pipelines lack climate-specific context and flexibility, thus, perform poorly in practice. We present ClimateAgent, an autonomous multi-agent framework that orchestrates end-to-end climate data analytic workflows. ClimateAgent decomposes user questions into executable sub-tasks coordinated by an Orchestrate-Agent and a Plan-Agent; acquires data via specialized Data-Agents that dynamically introspect APIs to synthesize robust download scripts; and completes analysis and reporting with a Coding-Agent that generates Python code, visualizations, and a final report with a built-in self-correction loop. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce Climate-Agent-Bench-85, a benchmark of 85 real-world tasks spanning atmospheric rivers, drought, extreme precipitation, heat waves, sea surface temperature, and tropical cyclones. On Climate-Agent-Bench-85, ClimateAgent achieves 100% task completion and a report quality score of 8.32, outperforming GitHub-Copilot (6.27) and a GPT-5 baseline (3.26). These results demonstrate that our multi-agent orchestration with dynamic API awareness and self-correcting execution substantially advances reliable, end-to-end automation for climate science analytic tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a unified framework for neural network compression utilizing information flow analysis for iterative pruning and architectural optimization, showing high compression with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancy in neural networks, both at filter and architectural levels, to improve efficiency and adaptability across diverse architectures.

Method: Utilize tensor flow divergence for a two-stage optimization process: divergence-aware filter pruning followed by layer-based architectural optimization.

Result: Experimental validations show significant model compression with competitive accuracy, outpacing state-of-the-art solutions across modern architectures.

Conclusion: Flow divergence proves effective in guiding optimizations, enabling practical deployment of compressed models in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network compression that addresses redundancy at both the filter and architectural levels through a unified framework grounded in information flow analysis. Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model compression while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to transformers. The results demonstrate how flow divergence serves as an effective guiding principle for both filter-level and layer-level optimization, offering practical benefits for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explores momentum's role in Federated Learning (FL) under unbounded heterogeneity, showing its limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if momentum can enhance convergence in distributed SGD under statistical heterogeneity in FL with partial client participation.

Method: Analyzed the efficacy of momentum with theoretical proofs under cyclic client participation, supported by numerical results and deep learning experiments.

Result: Proved momentum is still affected by statistical heterogeneity, and overly decreasing step-sizes lead to constrained convergence.

Conclusion: Momentum cannot fully mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity; careful parameter settings are crucial for desired convergence behavior.

Abstract: Recent works have explored the use of momentum in local methods to enhance distributed SGD. This is particularly appealing in Federated Learning (FL), where momentum intuitively appears as a solution to mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity. Despite recent progress in this direction, it is still unclear if momentum can guarantee convergence under unbounded heterogeneity in decentralized scenarios, where only some workers participate at each round. In this work we analyze momentum under cyclic client participation, and theoretically prove that it remains inevitably affected by statistical heterogeneity. Similarly to SGD, we prove that decreasing step-sizes do not help either: in fact, any schedule decreasing faster than $Θ\left(1/t\right)$ leads to convergence to a constant value that depends on the initialization and the heterogeneity bound. Numerical results corroborate the theory, and deep learning experiments confirm its relevance for realistic settings.

Motivation: To improve the performance of neural networks on small-sample tabular datasets, a problem where they traditionally underperform compared to tree-based models.

Method: AdaCap combines a permutation-based contrastive loss and Tikhonov-based closed-form output mapping. Additionally, a meta-predictor assesses when AdaCap offers benefits based on dataset characteristics.

Result: AdaCap showed consistent and statistically significant gains across 85 real-world regression datasets and various neural network architectures, particularly excelling in residual models.

Conclusion: AdaCap effectively strengthens neural networks through targeted regularization in small sample contexts, making them competitive in scenarios dominated by tree-based models.

Abstract: Neural networks struggle on small tabular datasets, where tree-based models remain dominant. We introduce Adaptive Contrastive Approach (AdaCap), a training scheme that combines a permutation-based contrastive loss with a Tikhonov-based closed-form output mapping. Across 85 real-world regression datasets and multiple architectures, AdaCap yields consistent and statistically significant improvements in the small-sample regime, particularly for residual models. A meta-predictor trained on dataset characteristics (size, skewness, noise) accurately anticipates when AdaCap is beneficial. These results show that AdaCap acts as a targeted regularization mechanism, strengthening neural networks precisely where they are most fragile.

### [375] [Learning Subgroups with Maximum Treatment Effects without Causal Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20189)
*Lincen Yang,Zhong Li,Matthijs van Leeuwen,Saber Salehkaleybar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a robust method for discovering subgroups with maximum average treatment effects using structural causal models (SCM), aiming to overcome limitations of traditional heuristic-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve subgroup discovery for targeted decision-making by addressing inadequacies in widely-used heuristic approaches and leveraging structural causal models.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework under the SCM to model subgroup discovery as a standard supervised learning problem, using partition-based methods like CART to identify subgroups.

Result: The proposed approach avoids heuristic causal methods and demonstrates superior accuracy against baselines on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets in identifying subgroups with maximum treatment effects.

Conclusion: Optimal subgroup discovery reduces to a standard supervised learning problem in the SCM framework, offering increased accuracy and practicality in domains requiring targeted decision-making.

Abstract: Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect.

### [376] [In-Context Compositional Learning via Sparse Coding Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20194)
*Wei Chen,Jingxi Yu,Zichen Miao,Qiang Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method to improve Transformers' performance on compositional tasks using sparse coding-inspired attention reformulation, showing success on specific datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face challenges with compositional learning tasks due to limited structural inductive bias.

Method: Attention mechanism reformulated with sparse coding principles, using learned encoding and decoding dictionaries with sparse coefficients.

Result: Tested on S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets, the proposed method outperforms standard Transformers on certain compositional tasks.

Conclusion: Sparse coding-based attention enhancement improves compositional rule learning, helping handle tasks where traditional Transformers struggle.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success across language, vision, and multimodal tasks, and there is growing demand for them to address in-context compositional learning tasks. In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets. For certain compositional generalization tasks, our method maintains performance even when standard Transformers fail, owing to its ability to learn and apply compositional rules.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and accurate machine learning in satellite constellations by addressing communication constraints in low-Earth orbit.

Method: The paper utilizes a federated learning approach by designing a communication-efficient algorithm with techniques like local training, compression, and an innovative error feedback mechanism for accuracy.

Result: Simulations in a realistic space scenario demonstrate superior performance of the developed algorithm compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed communication-efficient algorithm facilitates accurate and effective learning in satellite constellations, with broader applicability through its error feedback scheme.

Abstract: Satellite constellations in low-Earth orbit are now widespread, enabling positioning, Earth imaging, and communications. In this paper we address the solution of learning problems using these satellite constellations. In particular, we focus on a federated approach, where satellites collect and locally process data, with the ground station aggregating local models. We focus on designing a novel, communication-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of communications with the ground station (local training) and their size (compression). We then propose an error feedback mechanism that enhances accuracy, which yields, as a byproduct, an algorithm-agnostic error feedback scheme that can be more broadly applied. We analyze the convergence of the resulting algorithm, and compare it with the state of the art through simulations in a realistic space scenario, showcasing superior performance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses computational challenges in training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large multimodal graphs, proposing a novel framework, SR-GM, to optimize dataset synthesis and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale multimodal graphs, key to applications like e-commerce and recommendation systems, pose computational challenges for GNN training due to conflicting gradients and structural noise amplification.

Method: SR-GM employs a gradient decoupling mechanism through orthogonal projection and a structural damping regularizer leveraging Dirichlet energy to mitigate gradient conflicts and noise amplification.

Result: Experiments showed that SR-GM improves accuracy, enhances convergence rates over baselines, and allows condensed graphs with strong cross-architecture generalization.

Conclusion: SR-GM provides an efficient solution for multimodal graph learning, making it scalable for applications in resource-constrained environments and accelerating tasks like Neural Architecture Search.

Abstract: In critical web applications such as e-commerce and recommendation systems, multimodal graphs integrating rich visual and textual attributes are increasingly central, yet their large scale introduces substantial computational burdens for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search. This research provides a scalable methodology for multimodal graph-based learning in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiCaP, a framework to improve pseudo-labeling in semi-supervised multi-label learning by assigning weights reflecting pseudo-label correctness likelihood and introducing a dual-thresholding mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve semi-supervised multi-label learning by addressing the shortcomings of existing pseudo-labeling methods that assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels, which can amplify noisy predictions.

Method: Proposed a correctness-aware Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP) framework along with a dual-thresholding mechanism to weight pseudo-labels based on correctness likelihood and separated samples for enhanced learning.

Result: DiCaP achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 4.27% better performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively tackles the problem of noisy pseudo-labels, utilizing calibrated distribution weights and dual-thresholding to deliver improved performance in semi-supervised multi-label learning scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised multi-label learning (SSMLL) aims to address the challenge of limited labeled data in multi-label learning (MLL) by leveraging unlabeled data to improve the model's performance. While pseudo-labeling has become a dominant strategy in SSMLL, most existing methods assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels regardless of their quality, which can amplify the impact of noisy or uncertain predictions and degrade the overall performance. In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning. Experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets verify that our method achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to 4.27%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully boosts RL agents' generalization by leveraging predictive mechanisms and modifying training algorithms.

Abstract: Generalizability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents (ability to perform on environments different from the ones they have been trained on) is a key problem as agents have the tendency to overfit to their training environments. In order to address this problem and offer a solution to increase the generalizability of RL agents, we introduce a new methodology to predict the generalizability score of RL agents based on the internal weights of the agent's neural networks. Using this prediction capability, we propose some changes in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) loss function to boost the generalization score of the agents trained with this upgraded version. Experimental results demonstrate that our improved PPO algorithm yields agents with stronger generalizability compared to the original version.

Motivation: The research aims to address the trade-off between high predictive performance and interpretability in air pollution forecasting, which is critical for effective public health and air-quality management.

Method: The study develops a spatiotemporal learning framework comprising two modules: a physics-guided transport kernel based on wind and geography for advection, and an explainable attention mechanism to link future pollutant concentrations with historical and external drivers.

Result: Using data from the Stockholm region, the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple forecasting horizons while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework achieves both high predictive efficiency and spatiotemporal interpretability, making it a reliable tool for operational air-quality management in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable air pollution forecasting is crucial for public health, but most models face a trade-off between performance and interpretability. This study proposes a physics-guided, interpretable-by-design spatiotemporal learning framework. The model decomposes the spatiotemporal behavior of air pollutant concentrations into two transparent, additive modules. The first is a physics-guided transport kernel with directed weights conditioned on wind and geography (advection). The second is an explainable attention mechanism that learns local responses and attributes future concentrations to specific historical lags and exogenous drivers. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Stockholm region, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple forecasting horizons. Our model's integration of high predictive performance and spatiotemporal interpretability provides a more reliable foundation for operational air-quality management in real-world applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Anon, a novel adaptive optimizer that bridges the gap between adaptive and non-adaptive optimizers, offering tunable adaptivity and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the performance gap between adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) and non-adaptive methods (e.g., SGD) by improving adaptivity in optimization landscapes while maintaining generalization performance.

Method: The method involves proposing a new optimizer, Anon, which has tunable adaptivity. The optimizer includes an incremental delay update (IDU) technique to enhance robustness to gradient noise and ensure convergence in both convex and non-convex scenarios.

Result: Empirical results show that Anon outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers across tasks like image classification, diffusion, and language modeling while providing a balance between adaptive and non-adaptive methods.

Conclusion: Anon demonstrates that adaptivity can be a valuable design principle, bridging and surpassing the performance of both classical and modern optimizers, establishing a unified optimization framework.

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have achieved great success in training large-scale models like large language models and diffusion models. However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity
  , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.

Result: Both proposed techniques demonstrate improved decision-making for identifying suitable splits in Coding Units (CUs), effectively reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: The study validates the potential of ML-based approaches to accelerate VVC intra partitioning, offering a significant reduction in complexity while providing high-quality video coding performance.

Abstract: In this paper, a complexity study is conducted for Versatile Video Codec (VVC) intra partitioning to accelerate the exhaustive search involved in Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) process. To address this problem, two main machine learning techniques are proposed and compared. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approaches are size independent and incorporate the Rate-Distortion (RD) costs of neighboring blocks as input features. The first method is a regression based technique that predicts normalized RD costs of a given Coding Unit (CU). As partitioning possesses the Markov property, the associated decision-making problem can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by Reinforcement Learning (RL). The second approach is a RL agent learned from trajectories of CU decision across two depths with Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. Then a pre-determined thresholds are applied for both methods to select a suitable split for the current CU.

While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with scArches, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models.

*M. C. Schoppema,B. H. M. van der Velden,A. Hürriyetoğlu,M. D. Klijnstra,E. J. Faassen,A. Gerssen,H. J. van der Fels-Klerx*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Since 2012, TTX contamination in seafood like bivalve mollusks in European waters has raised food safety concerns. This study uses an explainable deep learning model to predict TTX contamination based on environmental factors, identifying sunlight, global radiation, water temperature, and chloride concentration as key contributors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address food safety risks and economic losses caused by TTX contamination in seafood. Predicting contamination is essential for the food industry and regulators.

Method: An explainable deep learning-based model was developed to predict the presence of TTX contamination in the Dutch Zeeland estuary using meteorological and hydrological data.

Result: The model identified key contributors to TTX contamination, including day length (sunrise/sunset), global radiation, water temperature, and chloride concentration.

Conclusion: The study provides a predictive tool for mitigating TTX contamination risks, emphasizing environmental factors' role in contamination, thus aiding the food industry and authorities in risk management.

Abstract: Since 2012, tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been found in seafoods such as bivalve mollusks in temperate European waters. TTX contamination leads to food safety risks and economic losses, making early prediction of TTX contamination vital to the food industry and competent authorities. Recent studies have pointed to shallow habitats and water temperature as main drivers to TTX contamination in bivalve mollusks. However, the temporal relationships between abiotic factors, biotic factors, and TTX contamination remain unexplored.
  We have developed an explainable, deep learning-based model to predict TTX contamination in the Dutch Zeeland estuary. Inputs for the model were meteorological and hydrological features; output was the presence or absence of TTX contamination.
  Results showed that the time of sunrise, time of sunset, global radiation, water temperature, and chloride concentration contributed most to TTX contamination. Thus, the effective number of sun hours, represented by day length and global radiation, was an important driver for tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks.
  To conclude, our explainable deep learning model identified the aforementioned environmental factors (number of sun hours, global radiation, water temperature, and water chloride concentration) to be associated with tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks; making our approach a valuable tool to mitigate marine toxin risks for food industry and competent authorities.

*Joël Charles-Rebuffé,Nicolas Gast,Bruno Gaujal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BLINQ, a model-based algorithm that estimates Whittle indices for a specific type of Markov Decision Process (MDP), outperforming standard Q-learning algorithms in both sample efficiency and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the inefficiency of existing Q-learning methods for computing Whittle indices in MDPs, seeking a more sample-efficient and computationally cost-effective solution.

Method: The methodology involves creating an empirical estimate of the MDP and calculating Whittle indices using an extended version of an advanced existing algorithm. Theoretical proof of convergence and computational complexity analysis are provided.

Result: BLINQ outperforms Q-learning algorithms in terms of fewer samples required for accurate approximation and achieves lower computational costs, even outperforming neural network-enhanced Q-learning.

Conclusion: BLINQ offers a more efficient alternative to Q-learning methods for calculating Whittle indices in MDPs, demonstrating strong performance in both sample efficiency and computational cost.

Abstract: We present BLINQ, a new model-based algorithm that learns the Whittle indices of an indexable, communicating and unichain Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach relies on building an empirical estimate of the MDP and then computing its Whittle indices using an extended version of a state-of-the-art existing algorithm. We provide a proof of convergence to the Whittle indices we want to learn as well as a bound on the time needed to learn them with arbitrary precision. Moreover, we investigate its computational complexity. Our numerical experiments suggest that BLINQ significantly outperforms existing Q-learning approaches in terms of the number of samples needed to get an accurate approximation. In addition, it has a total computational cost even lower than Q-learning for any reasonably high number of samples. These observations persist even when the Q-learning algorithms are speeded up using pre-trained neural networks to predict Q-values.

### [389] [Short-Range Oversquashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20406)
*Yaaqov Mishayev,Yonatan Sverdlov,Tal Amir,Nadav Dym*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses oversquashing in Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), identifying it in both short- and long-range tasks, and finds Graph Transformers to be a more effective solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the limitations of MPNNs in processing long-range dependencies due to oversquashing and the search for better methods to address this issue.

Method: The authors analyze and distinguish two mechanisms of oversquashing (bottleneck and vanishing gradient) and test the effectiveness of virtual nodes, rewiring, and transformers in resolving the issue.

Result: The findings reveal that short-range oversquashing is not explained by existing theories and cannot be mitigated by virtual nodes, whereas transformers perform well in such scenarios.

Conclusion: Graph Transformers are more effective than MPNNs and their modifications in addressing oversquashing, even for short-range tasks.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used for learning on graphs, but their ability to process long-range information is limited by the phenomenon of oversquashing. This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques.
  In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks.
  We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.

*Misha Padidar,Teresa Huang,Andrew Giuliani,Marina Spivak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine-learning-based method, particularly using a conditional diffusion model, to accelerate stellarator design by leveraging a large dataset of optimized designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The slow and computationally expensive design process of stellarators, vital for advancing fusion-based power plants, motivated the exploration of rapid design methodologies using machine learning.

Method: The authors employed a conditional diffusion model trained on the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs based on desired features like aspect ratio and mean rotational transform.

Result: The generated designs matched target characteristics with less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry, demonstrating solid performance but with room for improvement to achieve sub 1% deviation.

Conclusion: Machine learning methods, including generative models, show promise in accelerating and improving stellarator design, opening new avenues for innovation in this field.

Abstract: Stellarators are a prospective class of fusion-based power plants that confine a hot plasma with three-dimensional magnetic fields. Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.

*Shreevanth Krishnaa Gopalakrishnan,Stephen Hailes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the robustness of CSI-based human sensing systems against adversarial attacks, evaluating different model types and training methods while offering design recommendations for secure applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the vulnerability of machine learning-based CSI human sensing systems to adversarial perturbations, which could impact their security and reliability in real-world applications.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates the robustness of deep learning models for CSI using threat models like white-box, black-box, and universal perturbations, comparing compact and larger architectures across public datasets and examining training regimes and physical attack constraints.

Result: Experiments reveal that smaller models, while performing well on clean data, are less robust to adversarial attacks. Constraining attacks to physical signal-space reduces their success, and adversarial training improves robustness with minimal impact on clean performance.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for robust model design and provide a baseline for evaluating reliability, aiding the development of secure and trustworthy wireless sensing systems.

Abstract: Machine learning has become integral to Channel State Information (CSI)-based human sensing systems and is expected to power applications such as device-free activity recognition and identity detection in future cellular and Wi-Fi generations. However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.
  This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems.

*Kiril Vasilev,Alexandre Misrahi,Eeshaan Jain,Phil F Cheng,Petros Liakopoulos,Olivier Michielin,Michael Moor,Charlotte Bunne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTBBench, a new benchmark designed to simulate Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) workflows in oncology, addressing the limitations of current unimodal and decontextualized LLM evaluations. It highlights challenges in multimodal and longitudinal reasoning for biomedical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to represent the complexity of real-world clinical workflows such as MTB environments, which require integrating diverse data and resolving evolving challenges over time.

Method: MTBBench is developed as an agentic benchmark with validated clinical annotations through an app, evaluating multimodal LLMs in longitudinal decision-making tasks. It also incorporates tools to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: Evaluation of diverse LLMs demonstrated issues in reasoning reliability, such as hallucination and struggles with time-resolved data integration. MTBBench frameworks achieved performance gains of up to 9% in task-level reasoning and 11.2% in longitudinal reasoning.

Conclusion: MTBBench provides a more realistic testbed for developing and advancing multimodal LLM capabilities, especially in clinically complex, longitudinal oncology domains, fostering improved reliability and reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for biomedical reasoning, but current benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real-world clinical workflows. Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively. Overall, MTBBench offers a challenging and realistic testbed for advancing multimodal LLM reasoning, reliability, and tool-use with a focus on MTB environments in precision oncology.

TL;DR: The paper presents DP-MicroAdam, a novel adaptive optimizer for differential privacy (DP), achieving better performance and stability compared to traditional DP methods like DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and extensive tuning required in differentially private (DP) training with DP-SGD.

Method: The paper introduces DP-MicroAdam, a memory-efficient adaptive optimizer designed for stochastic non-convex optimization, which achieves an optimal convergence rate while respecting privacy constraints.

Result: DP-MicroAdam surpasses existing adaptive DP optimizers and demonstrates competitive to superior performance against DP-SGD on various datasets, including CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and transformer fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Adaptive optimization via DP-MicroAdam improves the performance and stability of differentially private training, making it a promising alternative to traditional approaches like DP-SGD.

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers are the de facto standard in non-private training as they often enable faster convergence and improved performance. In contrast, differentially private (DP) training is still predominantly performed with DP-SGD, typically requiring extensive compute and hyperparameter tuning. We propose DP-MicroAdam, a memory-efficient and sparsity-aware adaptive DP optimizer. We prove that DP-MicroAdam converges in stochastic non-convex optimization at the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, up to privacy-dependent constants. Empirically, DP-MicroAdam outperforms existing adaptive DP optimizers and achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to DP-SGD across a range of benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, large-scale ImageNet training, and private fine-tuning of pretrained transformers. These results demonstrate that adaptive optimization can improve both performance and stability under differential privacy.

### [396] [Adam Simplified: Bias Correction Simplified](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20516)
*Sam Laing,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the necessity of bias correction in the Adam optimizer, revealing its limited contribution under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the often-assumed importance of bias correction in the Adam optimizer, a key component whose empirical contribution is unclear.

Method: The paper employs systematic ablation studies across vision and language modelling tasks to investigate the role and impact of bias correction.

Result: Bias correction was found to provide no test performance improvement under optimal hyperparameters and, in some cases, negatively impacted performance without proper learning rate scheduling.

Conclusion: Bias correction in the Adam optimizer should not be universally included, as its benefits are conditional and highly dependent on contexts like hyperparameter tuning and scheduling.

Abstract: The Adam optimizer is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, yet the empirical necessity of each of its individual components is often taken for granted. This paper presents a focused investigation into the role of bias-correction, a feature whose contribution remains poorly understood. Through a series of systematic ablations on vision and language modelling tasks, we demonstrate that the conventional wisdom surrounding bias correction is misleading. In particular, we demonstrate that in the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, the inclusion of bias correction leads to no improvement in final test performance. Moreover, unless appropriate learning rate scheduling is implemented, the inclusion of bias correction can sometimes be detrimental to performance. We further reinterpret bias correction as a form of implicit learning rate scheduling whose behaviour is strongly dependent on the choice of smoothing hyper-parameters $β_1, β_2 \in [0,1)$. Our findings challenge the universal inclusion of this component.

*Alhasan Abdellatif,Hannah P. Menke,Ahmed H. Elsheikh,Florian Doster,Kamaljit Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced model that outperforms UFNO in gas saturation prediction by addressing its inefficiencies in handling scalar inputs and spatially varying error sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the predictive accuracy of the UFNO, which was limited by its inefficient handling of scalar inputs and lack of attention to spatial error sensitivity.

Method: The paper introduces UFNO-FiLM, which decouples scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer and employs a spatially weighted loss function to prioritize critical regions.

Result: UFNO-FiLM achieved a 21% reduction in gas saturation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to UFNO.

Conclusion: UFNO-FiLM demonstrates the effectiveness of decoupling scalar inputs and incorporating spatially sensitive loss functions, significantly enhancing predictive performance.

Abstract: The UNet-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) extends the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by incorporating a parallel UNet pathway, enabling the retention of both high- and low-frequency components. While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions. Our experiments on subsurface multiphase flow demonstrate a 21\% reduction in gas saturation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to UFNO, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in improving predictive accuracy.

*Rui Xue,Shichao Zhu,Liang Qin,Guangmou Pan,Yang Song,Tianfu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents E2E-GRec, an end-to-end framework for integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with recommender systems to address computational and optimization inefficiencies in conventional approaches, achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems using GNNs for recommendations rely on a two-stage process where GNNs are pre-trained offline. This separation leads to inefficiencies such as high computational costs and the inability to jointly optimize GNN and the recommender, resulting in suboptimal recommendations.

Method: The authors introduce E2E-GRec, which combines GNN training directly with recommender systems. Key methods include efficient subgraph sampling for scalability, a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder for learning meaningful embeddings, and a two-level feature fusion mechanism with Gradnorm-based loss balancing.

Result: E2E-GRec demonstrated significant performance improvements through extensive evaluations. Offline tests, online A/B testing, and theoretical analysis on large-scale data showed enhanced user engagement, including a +0.133% stay duration improvement and 0.3171% reduction in video skips.

Conclusion: E2E-GRec offers a more streamlined and effective solution to integrate GNNs with recommender systems, improving performance and resolving issues related to computational inefficiency and joint optimization limitations found in existing methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a deep learning model that adapts to non-stationary, complex time-series data by addressing various timescales and surpasses existing models on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models constrain temporal dynamics due to fixed-scale priors, limiting adaptability to the full spectrum of temporal variations, particularly in unpredictable high-magnitude changes.

Method: The MSTN introduces a multi-scale convolutional encoder, BiLSTM/Transformer sequence modeling, and a gated fusion mechanism with advanced attention techniques to handle diverse timescales and patterns in time-series data.

Result: MSTN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification, and generalization tasks, outperforming several advanced benchmarks on 24 of 32 datasets.

Conclusion: MSTN presents a robust, flexible architecture capable of adaptively modeling multi-timescale temporal patterns, establishing itself as a strong foundational framework for diverse temporal data tasks.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data is highly non stationary and complex in dynamics that operate across multiple timescales, ranging from fast, short-term changes to slow, long-term trends. Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST. In total, MSTN establishes new SOTA performance on 24 of 32 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its consistent performance across diverse temporal tasks.

*Shuo Xie,Tianhao Wang,Beining Wu,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between adaptive optimizers and normalized steepest descent (NSD) by extending adaptive smoothness to nonconvex settings and introducing adaptive gradient variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the theoretical link between adaptive optimizers and NSD under different geometrical smoothness conditions, and improve guarantees for convergence and acceleration.

Method: The research provides an extended theory of adaptive smoothness in nonconvex settings, develops comparisons in stochastic optimization, and introduces adaptive gradient variance to analyze performance under non-Euclidean geometry.

Result: The paper shows that adaptive smoothness characterizes convergence of adaptive optimizers in nonconvex scenarios and enables Nesterov momentum-based acceleration in convex settings, with dimension-free convergence guarantees in stochastic setups.

Conclusion: Adaptive geometric conditions like smoothness and gradient variance broaden the theoretical understanding and practical performance of adaptive optimizers beyond standard smoothness-based approaches.

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers can reduce to normalized steepest descent (NSD) when only adapting to the current gradient, suggesting a close connection between the two algorithmic families. A key distinction between their analyses, however, lies in the geometries, e.g., smoothness notions, they rely on. In the convex setting, adaptive optimizers are governed by a stronger adaptive smoothness condition, while NSD relies on the standard notion of smoothness. We extend the theory of adaptive smoothness to the nonconvex setting and show that it precisely characterizes the convergence of adaptive optimizers. Moreover, we establish that adaptive smoothness enables acceleration of adaptive optimizers with Nesterov momentum in the convex setting, a guarantee unattainable under standard smoothness for certain non-Euclidean geometry. We further develop an analogous comparison for stochastic optimization by introducing adaptive gradient variance, which parallels adaptive smoothness and leads to dimension-free convergence guarantees that cannot be achieved under standard gradient variance for certain non-Euclidean geometry.

Method: The framework uses cuboidal control domains, voxel-wise moments for geometric features, and persistent homology for topological features. It is implemented with latent diffusion models.

Result: Anatomica efficiently generates anatomically accurate structures, integrating complex constraints flexibly across dimensions and systems.

Conclusion: This framework offers a tool for rational synthetic dataset design, enhancing virtual trial capabilities and aiding machine learning workflows.

Abstract: We present Anatomica: an inference-time framework for generating multi-class anatomical voxel maps with localized geo-topological control. During generation, we use cuboidal control domains of varying dimensionality, location, and shape to slice out relevant substructures. These local substructures are used to compute differentiable penalty functions that steer the sample towards target constraints. We control geometric features such as size, shape, and position through voxel-wise moments, while topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids are enforced through persistent homology. Lastly, we implement Anatomica for latent diffusion models, where neural field decoders partially extract substructures, enabling the efficient control of anatomical properties. Anatomica applies flexibly across diverse anatomical systems, composing constraints to control complex structures over arbitrary dimensions and coordinate systems, thereby enabling the rational design of synthetic datasets for virtual trials or machine learning workflows.

*Charlotte Beylier,Hannah Selder,Arthur Fleig,Simon M. Hofmann,Nico Scherf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate how reinforcement learning agents develop attention during training and its impact on behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in understanding RL agents' learning processes beyond algorithmic formulations, focusing on attention development during training.

Method: ATOMs were tested on three Pong game variations designed to instill distinct behaviors, using a controlled experimental setup combined with behavioral assessments.

Result: ATOMs differentiated attention patterns across different training variations, revealing consistent phased development in attention, which was linked to behavioral differences.

Conclusion: ATOM is a promising tool for enhancing our comprehension of RL agents' learning mechanisms, particularly the interplay between attention and learning.

Abstract: The learning process of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent remains poorly understood beyond the mathematical formulation of its learning algorithm. To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations. Overall, we believe that ATOM could help improve our understanding of the learning processes of RL agents and better understand the relationship between attention and learning.

### [403] [Latent Diffusion Inversion Requires Understanding the Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20592)
*Mingxing Rao,Bowen Qu,Daniel Moyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the latent code memorization in Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and introduces a method to rank dimensions contributing to memorization, enhancing attack accuracy for privacy risk analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how latent diffusion models memorize training data and identifying risks associated with this memorization in generative models.

Method: Developing a technique to rank latent dimensions based on their contribution to decoder pullback metric and studying non-uniform memorization patterns for privacy analysis.

Result: Removing less-memorizing dimensions improved membership inference attacks' performance with AUROC gains of 2.7% and TPR@1%FPR increases by 6.42% across different datasets.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes auto-encoder geometry's role in LDM memorization and offers insights into privacy risks, providing enhanced methods for privacy analysis in generative models.

Abstract: The recovery of training data from generative models (``model inversion'') has been extensively studied for diffusion models in the data domain. The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization. Empirically, removing less-memorizing dimensions when computing attack statistics for score-based membership inference attacker significantly improves performance, with average AUROC gains of 2.7\% and substantial increases in TPR@1\%FPR (6.42\%) across diverse datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-1K, Pokémon, MS-COCO, and Flickr. This indicates stronger confidence in identifying members under extremely low false-positive tolerance. Our results highlight the overlooked influence of the auto-encoder geometry on LDM memorization and provide a new perspective for analyzing privacy risks in diffusion-based generative models.

TL;DR: This paper addresses security challenges of integrating AI agents into web browsers, focusing on prompt injection attacks with real-world implications. It provides a benchmark, evaluates defenses, and proposes a multi-layered defensive framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient exploration of the real-world impact of prompt injection attacks on AI-integrated web browsers and improve their security.

Method: The authors designed a benchmark of realistic prompt injection attacks, assessed the effectiveness of current defenses on various AI models, and proposed a multi-layered defense strategy.

Result: The benchmark revealed limitations in existing defenses, showing the effectiveness of a multi-layered defense strategy to counteract prompt injection attacks.

Conclusion: A defense-in-depth approach is crucial for designing secure AI web agents against evolving prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into web browsers introduces security challenges that go beyond traditional web application threat models. Prior work has identified prompt injection as a new attack vector for web agents, yet the resulting impact within real-world environments remains insufficiently understood.
  In this work, we examine the landscape of prompt injection attacks and synthesize a benchmark of attacks embedded in realistic HTML payloads. Our benchmark goes beyond prior work by emphasizing injections that can influence real-world actions rather than mere text outputs, and by presenting attack payloads with complexity and distractor frequency similar to what real-world agents encounter. We leverage this benchmark to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing defenses, assessing their effectiveness across a suite of frontier AI models. We propose a multi-layered defense strategy comprising both architectural and model-based defenses to protect against evolving prompt injection attacks. Our work offers a blueprint for designing practical, secure web agents through a defense-in-depth approach.

### [405] [The Driver-Blindness Phenomenon: Why Deep Sequence Models Default to Autocorrelation in Blood Glucose Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20601)
*Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses 'Driver-Blindness' in blood glucose forecasting models where critical drivers like insulin and meals are not utilized effectively. Authors analyze reasons and propose mitigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blood glucose forecasting models fail to incorporate important clinical factors such as insulin and meals, despite their physiological importance, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors formalize 'Driver-Blindness' using a metric ($Δ_{drivers}$), analyze biases and challenges within models, and suggest methods like feature engineering, causal regularization, and model personalization to address these issues.

Result: Across studies, models were found failing to leverage drivers effectively with negligible $Δ_{drivers}$. Proposed methods showed partial mitigation of the issue.

Conclusion: Driver-Blindness hinders model progress in blood glucose prediction. Reporting $Δ_{drivers}$ and adopting proposed strategies are advised to ensure robust, driver-aware models.

Abstract: Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers--insulin, meals, and activity--despite well-understood physiological mechanisms. We term this Driver-Blindness and formalize it via $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines. Across the literature, $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ is typically near zero. We attribute this to three interacting factors: architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps that render drivers noisy and confounded (C2), and physiological heterogeneity that undermines population-level models (C3). We synthesize strategies that partially mitigate Driver-Blindness--including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization--and recommend that future work routinely report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art.

### [406] [Adaptive Hopfield Network: Rethinking Similarities in Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20609)
*Shurong Wang,Yuqi Pan,Zhuoyang Shen,Meng Zhang,Hongwei Wang,Guoqi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses flaws in existing associative memory models and introduces a novel mechanism called adaptive similarity for improved pattern retrieval, demonstrated through a new adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop) with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of existing associative memory models, which fail to ensure correct retrieval by relying solely on proximity as a measure of quality.

Method: The paper reframes associative memory as a process where queries are generative variants of stored patterns, introducing adaptive similarity to approximate unknown likelihoods for correct retrieval. This is theoretically proven across three canonical variant types: noisy, masked, and biased.

Result: Developed an adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop) that integrates adaptive similarity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in memory retrieval, tabular and image classification, and multiple instance learning.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive similarity mechanism and the A-Hop network improve correctness in associative memory retrieval and generalize effectively across various practical tasks.

Abstract: Associative memory models are content-addressable memory systems fundamental to biological intelligence and are notable for their high interpretability. However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning.

*Yujin Kim,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Stochastic NODE-DMD, a novel method that extends Dynamic Mode Decomposition to handle sparse/noisy data and nonlinear systems with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling dynamic, hard-to-predict systems like wind fields and ocean currents is essential, but current methods face challenges with sparse/noisy data and linear limitations.

Method: The authors develop a probabilistic extension of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) called Stochastic NODE-DMD, which uses data-driven techniques for continuous-time, nonlinear systems with uncertainty quantification.

Result: The method outperforms a baseline in reconstruction accuracy with limited data, aligns modes with true dynamics, and maintains variability in datasets with multiple realizations.

Conclusion: Stochastic NODE-DMD offers an interpretable and effective means of modeling nonlinear, spatiotemporal dynamics with uncertainty quantification, addressing key challenges in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Many consequential real-world systems, like wind fields and ocean currents, are dynamic and hard to model. Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

*Panayiotis Danassis,Naman Goel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world logistics problems, finding human-coded agents outperform LLMs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of LLMs in code generation lacks proper benchmarking for complex real-world challenges like logistics optimization, which involves strategic thinking.

Method: Proposing a benchmark based on the Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem with strategic bidding and task optimization, testing 40 LLM-coded agents against human-coded agents in competitive tournaments.

Result: Human-coded agents consistently outperform LLM-coded agents, where most LLM-generated solutions fail even against simple baselines.

Conclusion: LLMs currently struggle with reasoning-driven code synthesis required in competitive real-world scenarios, demonstrating a need for better evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI-assisted code generation. This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness. Such metrics understate the difficulty of many real-world problems that require planning, optimization, and strategic interaction. We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world scenarios.

### [409] [DiFR: Inference Verification Despite Nondeterminism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20621)
*Adam Karvonen,Daniel Reuter,Roy Rinberg,Luke Marks,Adrià Garriga-Alonso,Keri Warr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods, Token-DiFR and Activation-DiFR, to verify LLM inference and detect issues like sampling errors, bugs, or model quantization efficiently, even with minimal output tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to verify the correctness of LLM inferences as their usage increases, given the challenge that numerical noise often creates different outputs for the same inputs, complicating verification.

Method: The authors propose Token-DiFR, which uses synced sampling seeds for output verification, and Activation-DiFR, which employs orthogonal projections to fingerprint activations for efficient forward-pass verification.

Result: Token-DiFR reliably identifies errors and quantization issues with high accuracy (e.g., AUC > 0.999 for detecting 4-bit quantization in 300 tokens). Activation-DiFR achieves similar detection with just 2 tokens, reducing communication overhead compared to current methods.

Conclusion: The framework detects inconsistencies and quantization issues using simple and efficient mechanisms, with open-source implementation available for practical deployment.

Abstract: As demand for LLM inference grows, it is becoming increasingly important that providers and their customers can verify that inference processes are performed correctly, without errors or tampering. However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods. We release an open-source integration with vLLM to accelerate practical deployment of verifiable inference.

*Wei He,Kai Han,Hang Zhou,Hanting Chen,Zhicheng Liu,Xinghao Chen,Yunhe Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer, designed to address robustness issues in optimizing large language models (LLMs). ROOT incorporates dimension-robust orthogonalization and optimization-robust frameworks to improve stability, faster convergence, and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing LLMs is challenging due to scaling-induced sensitivity to imprecision and instability. Current optimizers like Muon improve efficiency but face robustness issues. This paper seeks to address these limitations.

Method: ROOT leverages a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme with adaptive Newton iterations for consistent precision and a proximal optimization framework to counter outlier-induced noise while preserving key gradient directions.

Result: Experimental results show ROOT's improved robustness, faster convergence, and better performance in noisy and non-convex training scenarios as compared to Muon and Adam-based optimizers.

Conclusion: ROOT provides a robust solution for optimizing large language models, addressing fragility and noise issues, and setting a new standard for robust optimizer development in large-scale model training.

Abstract: The optimization of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly as model scaling exacerbates sensitivity to algorithmic imprecision and training instability. Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for developing robust and precise optimizers capable of handling the complexities of modern large-scale model training.

*Ziyue Wang,Yayati Jadhav,Peter Pak,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Image2Gcode, a method to bypass CAD modeling by directly transforming 2D images into printer-ready G-code, streamlining the design-to-fabrication process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dependency on slow and manual CAD modeling hinders rapid prototyping and design iteration in manufacturing workflows.

Method: The approach uses a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to convert 2D images into slice-based structural cues and executable print paths in the form of G-code.

Result: Image2Gcode simplifies the manufacturing pipeline by skipping CAD or STL stages, allowing direct G-code generation from images, and supports on-demand prototyping.

Conclusion: The framework reduces complexity in additive manufacturing, fosters accessibility, and accelerates concept-to-product workflows while integrating with 2D-to-3D reconstruction for automation.

Abstract: Mechanical design and manufacturing workflows conventionally begin with conceptual design, followed by the creation of a computer-aided design (CAD) model and fabrication through material-extrusion (MEX) printing. This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact. The result is a flexible, computationally efficient framework that advances accessibility in design iteration, repair workflows, and distributed manufacturing.

*Sian Heesom-Green,Jonathan Shock,Geoff Nitschke*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This study examines how environmental variability and energy costs influence the evolution of neural network size and structure in reinforcement learning agents, challenging the Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis (CBH) and supporting the Expensive Brain Hypothesis (EBH).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how energy constraints and environmental variability impact the evolution of brain size and organization and to provide insights into biological theory and potential robotic design.

Method: The study uses evolved Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to model the effects of energy costs and environmental seasonality on neural complexity, assessed in terms of ANN size and organization.

Result: It was found that in environments with high seasonal variability and energy constraints, smaller ANNs evolved. Additionally, energy efficiency influenced the development of ANN structures, promoting optimized architectures.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis (CBH) by showing that energy constraints in highly seasonal environments limit brain size, supporting the Expensive Brain Hypothesis (EBH). The results also emphasize the importance of energy-efficient designs for both biological and artificial systems.

Abstract: The Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis (CBH) posits that larger brains evolved to enhance survival in changing conditions. However, larger brains also carry higher energy demands, imposing additional metabolic burdens. Alongside brain size, brain organization plays a key role in cognitive ability and, with suitable architectures, may help mitigate energy challenges. This study evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) used by Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to investigate how environmental variability and energy costs influence the evolution of neural complexity, defined in terms of ANN size and structure. Results indicate that under energy constraints, increasing seasonality led to smaller ANNs. This challenges CBH and supports the Expensive Brain Hypothesis (EBH), as highly seasonal environments reduced net energy intake and thereby constrained brain size. ANN structural complexity primarily emerged as a byproduct of size, where energy costs promoted the evolution of more efficient networks. These results highlight the role of energy constraints in shaping neural complexity, offering in silico support for biological theory and energy-efficient robotic design.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper discusses mechanizing the proof-relevant logical relation proposed by Yao et al. for verifying timed message-passing protocols using the Rocq theorem prover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a mechanized proof to enhance the scalability, formalization, and application of logical relations for verifying timed message-passing protocols, especially in heterogeneous applications like IoT and real-time systems.

Method: The authors mechanized the logical relation, algebra of computable trajectories, supporting lemmas, and fundamental theorem in a proof assistant, addressing challenges in handling trajectory equations in intensional type theory.

Result: The mechanization process accommodates trajectories' interleaving, partitioning, and concatenation, addressing equality on trajectories via their graphs indexed by time.

Conclusion: The mechanized system enhances the formal foundation and scalability of Yao et al.'s semantic typing for verifying heterogeneous timed systems.

Abstract: Semantic typing has become a powerful tool for program verification, applying the technique of logical relations as not only a proof method, but also a device for prescribing program behavior. In recent work, Yao et al. scaled semantic typing to the verification of timed message-passing protocols, which are prevalent in, e.g., IoT and real-time systems applications. The appeal of semantic typing in this context is precisely because of its ability to support typed and untyped program components alike -- including physical objects -- which caters to the heterogeneity of these applications. Another demand inherent to these applications is timing: constraining the time or time window within which a message exchange must happen. Yao et al. equipped their logical relation not only with temporal predicates, but also with computable trajectories, to supply the evidence that an inhabitant can step from one time point to another one. While Yao et al. provide the formalization for such a verification tool, it lacks a mechanization. Mechanizing the system would not only provide a machine proof for it, but also facilitate scalability for future extensions and applications.
  This paper tackles the challenge of mechanizing the resulting proof-relevant logical relation in a proof assistant. allowing trajectories to be interleaved, partitioned, and concatenated, while the intended equality on trajectories is the equality of their graphs when seen as processes indexed by time. Unfortunately, proof assistants based on intensional type theory only have modest support for such equations, forcing a prolific use of transports. This paper reports on the process of mechanizing Yao et al.'s results, comprising the logical relation, the algebra of computable trajectories with supporting lemmas, and the fundamental theorem of the logical relation, in the Rocq theorem prover.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Petal, a profiling tool for the Calyx intermediate language (IL) to help programmers identify and resolve performance issues in ADL (Accelerator Design Languages).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADL compilers face challenges in bridging the semantic gap from high-level languages to efficient hardware generation, often resulting in unpredictable performance and requiring debugging tools.

Method: Petal analyzes cycle-level profiles by instrumenting Calyx code with probes, then tracing register-transfer-level simulations to map events to control constructs for performance insights.

Result: Case studies show Petal successfully identified performance issues and guided optimizations, achieving a 46.9% reduction in cycles for one application.

Conclusion: Petal offers critical insight into compiler decisions, enhancing the understanding and control of application-specific hardware design performance.

Abstract: Accelerator design languages (ADLs), high-level languages that compile to hardware units, help domain experts quickly design efficient application-specific hardware. ADL compilers optimize datapaths and convert software-like control flow constructs into control paths. Such compilers are necessarily complex and often unpredictable: they must bridge the wide semantic gap between high-level semantics and cycle-level schedules, and they typically rely on advanced heuristics to optimize circuits. The resulting performance can be difficult to control, requiring guesswork to find and resolve performance problems in the generated hardware. We conjecture that ADL compilers will never be perfect: some performance unpredictability is endemic to the problem they solve.
  In lieu of compiler perfection, we argue for compiler understanding tools that give ADL programmers insight into how the compiler's decisions affect performance. We introduce Petal, a cycle-level Petal for the Calyx intermediate language (IL). Petal instruments the Calyx code with probes and then analyzes the trace from a register-transfer-level simulation. It maps the events in the trace back to high-level control constructs in the Calyx code to track the clock cycles when each construct was active. Using case studies, we demonstrate that Petal's cycle-level profiles can identify performance problems in existing accelerator designs. We show that these insights can also guide developers toward optimizations that the compiler was unable to perform automatically, including a reduction by 46.9\% of total cycles for one application.

*Frank Schüssele,Matthias Zumkeller,Miriam Lagunes-Rochin,Dominik Klumpp*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving automatic correctness certification for concurrent programs by converting interleaving-dependent proofs into compact thread-modular proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implementing bug-free algorithmic verifiers for concurrent programs is challenging. Certifying correctness results can help detect verification flaws efficiently.

Method: The authors propose generating thread-modular correctness proofs by synthesizing ghost variables to encapsulate relevant interleaving information and abstracting away unnecessary details.

Result: The approach efficiently generates compact correctness proofs in practice, outperforming a baseline.

Conclusion: Thread-modular proofs simplify the validation of correctness results for concurrent programs and reduce potential verification errors.

Abstract: Implementation bugs threaten the soundness of algorithmic software verifiers. Generating correctness certificates for correct programs allows for efficient independent validation of verification results, and thus helps to reveal such bugs. Automatic generation of small, compact correctness proofs for concurrent programs is challenging, as the correctness arguments may depend on the particular interleaving, which can lead to exponential explosion. We present an approach that converts an interleaving-based correctness proof, as generated by many algorithmic verifiers, into a thread-modular correctness proof in the style of Owicki and Gries. We automatically synthesize ghost variables that capture the relevant interleaving information, and abstract away irrelevant details. Our evaluation shows that the approach is efficient in practice and generates compact proofs, compared to a baseline.

Motivation: Current reliance on human teleoperation for generating high-quality manipulation trajectories is expensive and non-scalable, while RL methods, though scalable, produce limited diversity in solutions, restricting their utility for large-scale pretraining.

Method: The authors propose DLR, an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, successful behavioral patterns for tasks, thereby producing a diverse trajectory dataset.

Result: Empirical results show that DLR generates a significantly diverse trajectory corpus compared to standard RL and consistently improves VLA models' adaptability and performance on unseen tasks.

Conclusion: DLR positions multi-pattern RL as a practical and scalable approach for producing diverse data essential for embodied foundation models, outperforming standard RL datasets in pretraining efficacy.

Abstract: Scaling vision-language-action (VLA) model pre-training requires large volumes of diverse, high-quality manipulation trajectories. Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve efficiency in robot object handovers by addressing adaptability to dynamic pose changes.

Method: Use Virtual Model Control for robot adaptation and augmented reality for communication during handovers. Tested through experiments and a user study.

Result: The approach proves resilient to uncertainties and receives user preference, offering insights for future advancements.

Conclusion: Virtual Model Control and augmented reality enhance adaptability and interactions in robot object handover scenarios.

Abstract: Object handover is a common form of interaction that is widely present in collaborative tasks. However, achieving it efficiently remains a challenge. We address the problem of ensuring resilient robotic actions that can adapt to complex changes in object pose during human-to-robot object handovers. We propose the use of Virtual Model Control to create an interaction layer that controls the robot and adapts to the dynamic changes in the handover process. Additionally, we propose the use of augmented reality to facilitate bidirectional communication between humans and robots during handovers. We assess the performance of our controller in a set of experiments that demonstrate its resilience to various sources of uncertainties, including complex changes to the object's pose during the handover. Finally, we performed a user study with 16 participants to understand human preferences for different robot control profiles and augmented reality visuals in object handovers. Our results showed a general preference for the proposed approach and revealed insights that can guide further development in adapting the interaction with the user.

*Jennifer Grannen,Michelle Pan,Kenneth Llontop,Cherie Ho,Mark Zolotas,Jeannette Bohg,Dorsa Sadigh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, enabling robots to collect real-world data to improve foundation models (FM) for messy, real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although foundation models exhibit strong zero-shot abilities, their reliance on internet training data makes them fragile in unstructured real-world settings due to underrepresented scenarios. Robots can bridge this gap by collecting context-specific real-world data.

Method: The authors deploy a robot, Scanford, equipped with vision-language models to autonomously scan library shelves, identify books, and label images using the library catalog without human annotation, generating valuable training data.

Result: Deploying Scanford for 2 weeks yielded significant performance improvements in both domain-specific tasks (book identification rising from 32.0% to 71.8%) and domain-adjacent benchmarks (multilingual OCR with up to a 21.8% increase). Additionally, it saved ~18.7 hours of human effort.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates how autonomous robots deployed in real-world environments can continuously adapt foundation models while reducing human intervention, enabling better performance and applicability of FMs in realistic settings.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have unlocked powerful zero-shot capabilities in vision and language, yet their reliance on internet pretraining data leaves them brittle in unstructured, real-world settings. The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a learning-enhanced adaptive control barrier function using Neural ODEs to improve real-world safety of systems like drones under dynamic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the challenge of ensuring safety guarantees using CBFs in real-world systems where model inaccuracies due to disturbances (e.g., wind) or payload variability may compromise performance.

Method: The authors introduce a hybrid approach combining online learning and high-order adaptive control barrier functions using Neural ODEs to adjust safety controls dynamically.

Result: The proposed method was successfully implemented on a nano quadrotor, maintaining safety despite external disturbances such as 18km/h wind.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that adaptive learning can address model inaccuracies in real-time, enhancing the practical safety applications of CBFs in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are an effective model-based tool to formally certify the safety of a system. With the growing complexity of modern control problems, CBFs have received increasing attention in both optimization-based and learning-based control communities as a safety filter, owing to their provable guarantees. However, success in transferring these guarantees to real-world systems is critically tied to model accuracy. For example, payloads or wind disturbances can significantly influence the dynamics of an aerial vehicle and invalidate the safety guarantee. In this work, we propose an efficient yet flexible online learning-enhanced high-order adaptive control barrier function using Neural ODEs. Our approach improves the safety of a CBF-certified system on the fly, even under complex time-varying model perturbations. In particular, we deploy our hybrid adaptive CBF controller on a 38g nano quadrotor, keeping a safe distance from the obstacle, against 18km/h wind.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address collision avoidance in multi-UAV formation-flying, ensuring safe and efficient path planning for large numbers of UAVs.

Method: The process involves creating a flow network from GPS coordinates, finding the minimum-cost paths using graph-based algorithms, and applying the Ford-Fulkerson Method to optimize paths for maximum flow and collision avoidance.

Result: Simulations for up to 64 UAVs and practical experiments with 3 quadcopters demonstrated the method's capability to produce collision-free and feasible paths.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in generating safe and efficient paths for multi-UAV formations through its flow network approach.

Abstract: Collision-free path planning is the most crucial component in multi-UAV formation-flying (MFF). We use unlabeled homogenous quadcopters (UAVs) to demonstrate the use of a flow network to create complete (inter-UAV) collision-free paths. This procedure has three main parts: 1) Creating a flow network graph from physical GPS coordinates, 2) Finding a path of minimum cost (least distance) using any graph-based path-finding algorithm, and 3) Implementing the Ford-Fulkerson Method to find the paths with the maximum flow (no collision). Simulations of up to 64 UAVs were conducted for various formations, followed by a practical experiment with 3 quadcopters for testing physical plausibility and feasibility. The results of these tests show the efficacy of this method's ability to produce safe, collision-free paths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance trajectory tracking stability and precision in autonomous vehicles equipped with Ackermann-style steering systems by integrating lane identification into the control mechanism.

Method: The paper employs techniques such as edge recognition, sliding window-based lane line extraction, dynamic ROI extraction, and implements an MPC based on a bicycle dynamics model. Simulations in ROS Gazebo evaluate the controller's performance.

Result: Simulation results show a 27.65% reduction in root mean square error between optimal and target trajectories, indicating improved robustness and flexibility of the controller.

Conclusion: The developed method is effective in enhancing trajectory tracking accuracy for camera-equipped autonomous vehicles, demonstrating promising application potential in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are becoming popular day by day not only for autonomous road traversal but also for industrial automation, farming and military. Most of the standard vehicles follow the Ackermann style steering mechanism. This has become to de facto standard for large and long faring vehicles. The local planner of an autonomous vehicle controls the low-level vehicle movement upon which the vehicle will perform its motor actuation. In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction. Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance. The root mean square error between the optimal tracking trajectory and the target trajectory was reduced by 27.65% in the simulation results, demonstrating the high robustness and flexibility of the developed controller.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Gatekeeper framework to achieve provable safety guarantees for leader-follower multi-agent formations in 3D environments. It outperforms baseline methods in safety and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the limitation of existing methods for formation control: online planners lack safety guarantees, and offline planners are inflexible to agent or formation changes.

Method: The proposed hybrid architecture employs a leader agent that tracks a pre-computed safe trajectory, serving as a shared backup for followers, ensuring collision avoidance with static obstacles and agents.

Result: The method achieved a 100% collision-avoidance success rate in simulations of 100 randomized trials, surpassing baseline methods, and was validated on quadcopters.

Conclusion: This framework effectively bridges the gap between provable safety and adaptability in multi-agent systems in 3D environments, demonstrating its safety and real-world applicability.

Abstract: We present Multi-Agent gatekeeper, a framework that provides provable safety guarantees for leader-follower formation control in cluttered 3D environments. Existing methods face a trad-off: online planners and controllers lack formal safety guarantees, while offline planners lack adaptability to changes in the number of agents or desired formation. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid architecture where a single leader tracks a pre-computed, safe trajectory, which serves as a shared trajectory backup set for all follower agents. Followers execute a nominal formation-keeping tracking controller, and are guaranteed to remain safe by always possessing a known-safe backup maneuver along the leader's path. We formally prove this method ensures collision avoidance with both static obstacles and other agents. The primary contributions are: (1) the multi-agent gatekeeper algorithm, which extends our single-agent gatekeeper framework to multi-agent systems; (2) the trajectory backup set for provably safe inter-agent coordination for leader-follower formation control; and (3) the first application of the gatekeeper framework in a 3D environment. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated 3D urban environment, where it achieved a 100% collision-avoidance success rate across 100 randomized trials, significantly outperforming baseline CBF and NMPC methods. Finally, we demonstrate the physical feasibility of the resulting trajectories on a team of quadcopters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the challenges posed by loco-manipulation tasks which require coordinated whole-body motion to manipulate objects while maintaining stability.

Method: A whole-body model predictive control (MPC) framework directly optimizes joint torques using full-order inverse dynamics, implemented with open software frameworks and a state-of-the-art solver.

Result: The framework achieves real-time control at 80 Hz and demonstrates effectiveness in various loco-manipulation tasks using a quadruped robot equipped with a manipulator.

Conclusion: The proposed MPC framework successfully integrates motion and force control, allowing dynamic, real-world interaction tasks and showing the feasibility of the approach for practical applications.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation demands coordinated whole-body motion to manipulate objects effectively while maintaining locomotion stability, presenting significant challenges for both planning and control. In this work, we propose a whole-body model predictive control (MPC) framework that directly optimizes joint torques through full-order inverse dynamics, enabling unified motion and force planning and execution within a single predictive layer. This approach allows emergent, physically consistent whole-body behaviors that account for the system's dynamics and physical constraints. We implement our MPC formulation using open software frameworks (Pinocchio and CasADi), along with the state-of-the-art interior-point solver Fatrop. In real-world experiments on a Unitree B2 quadruped equipped with a Unitree Z1 manipulator arm, our MPC formulation achieves real-time performance at 80 Hz. We demonstrate loco-manipulation tasks that demand fine control over the end-effector's position and force to perform real-world interactions like pulling heavy loads, pushing boxes, and wiping whiteboards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues in robotic agents like modality gaps between visual observations and actions, and unstable training caused by competing objectives.

Method: VITA uses a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling implicit visual chain-of-thought to guide motion planning through joint visual prediction and action generation.

Result: VITA showed superior performance with a 14.5%, 9.6%, and 12.1% improvement on CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv benchmarks, and achieved an 80.5% success rate in six real-world tasks.

Conclusion: VITA effectively integrates visual dynamics for motion planning, demonstrating potential as a general-purpose robotic manipulation model.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built upon Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have achieved remarkable success in advancing general-purpose robotic agents, owing to its significant perceptual comprehension. Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\%, 9.6\% and 12.1\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv. Furthermore, VITA attains an average success rate of 80.5\% across six real-world tasks, demonstrating its potential as a generalist robotic manipulation model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations in autonomous control performance due to joystick and human dynamics during teleoperation in uncertain or constrained environments.

Method: A cooperative framework using a control barrier function to selectively ignore joystick inputs in safe regions while engaging HSC otherwise. Pilot testing was done with a simulated underwater robot in a virtual environment.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated increased accuracy and decreased task completion time compared to conventional HSC.

Conclusion: Integrating joystick-independent autonomous control with HSC can significantly improve performance and efficiency in teleoperation tasks.

Abstract: Haptic shared control (HSC) is effective in teleoperation when full autonomy is limited by uncertainty or sensing constraints. However, autonomous control performance achieved by maximizing HSC strength is limited because the dynamics of the joystick and human arm affect the robot's behavior. We propose a cooperative framework coupling a joystick-independent autonomous controller with HSC. A control barrier function ignores joystick inputs within a safe region determined by the human operator in real-time, while HSC is engaged otherwise. A pilot experiment on simulated tasks with tele-operated underwater robot in virtual environment demonstrated improved accuracy and reduced required time over conventional HSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of autonomous driving systems in handling complex, rare scenarios and the lack of effective integration of both simulation and real-world data.

Method: The framework introduces a VLM-guided adversarial transfer approach using Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Models (CoC VLMs) for cross-domain knowledge transfer.

Result: The CoC-VLA framework demonstrates improved reasoning and handling of long-tail driving scenarios by integrating capabilities across simulation and real-world deployments.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances autonomous driving systems by bridging the gap between simulated and real-world scenarios, leveraging temporal reasoning and adversarial training.

Abstract: Autonomous driving represents a prominent application of artificial intelligence. Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the 3D bin packing problem by proposing a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework combined with physical simulation and real-world data feedback to reduce packing collapse rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for 3D bin packing are overly simplified, treating the problem as discrete and static, which fails to account for real-world continuous and gravity-induced interactions, leading to instability in practical deployments.

Method: A hybrid RL framework is utilized, incorporating domain randomization to expose agents to diverse physical parameters and fine-tuning with real-world feedback to improve stability. Physical simulations are used to emulate realistic gravity effects.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved packing stability, achieving a 35% reduction in collapse rates compared to baselines, both in simulations and real-world logistics systems.

Conclusion: Incorporating physical simulations and real-world feedback enhances the robustness and effectiveness of RL-based methods for 3D bin packing problems, proving practical for large-scale logistics applications.

Abstract: The 3D bin packing problem, with its diverse industrial applications, has garnered significant research attention in recent years. Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and fragility barriers preventing widespread adoption of six-axis force-torque sensors for robotic manipulation.

Method: ShapeForce uses a compliant core and marker-based pose tracking to measure deformations caused by external force and torque, converting them into force-like signals without calibration or advanced electronics.

Result: Experiments show ShapeForce delivers manipulation performance comparable to traditional six-axis force-torque sensors at a significantly reduced cost.

Conclusion: ShapeForce provides an accessible and cost-effective solution for contact feedback in robotic manipulation, potentially fostering broader adoption in contact-rich tasks.

Abstract: Contact feedback is essential for contact-rich robotic manipulation, as it allows the robot to detect subtle interaction changes and adjust its actions accordingly. Six-axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging datasets, showcasing improvements in accuracy, completeness, and rendering quality.

Conclusion: The active exploration framework proves effective in advancing 3D active reconstruction and robotic perception capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an active exploration framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction that incrementally builds a multi-level uncertainty space and selects next-best-views through an uncertainty-driven motion planner. We introduce a hybrid implicit-explicit representation that fuses neural fields with Gaussian primitives to jointly capture global structural priors and locally observed details. Based on this hybrid state, we derive a hierarchical uncertainty volume that quantifies both implicit global structure quality and explicit local surface confidence. To focus optimization on the most informative regions, we propose an uncertainty-driven keyframe selection strategy that anchors high-entropy viewpoints as sparse attention nodes, coupled with a viewpoint-space sliding window for uncertainty-aware local refinement. The planning module formulates next-best-view selection as an Expected Hybrid Information Gain problem and incorporates a risk-sensitive path planner to ensure efficient and safe exploration. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, completeness, and rendering quality, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world active reconstruction and robotic perception tasks.

Method: Inspired by human motor control, the proposed framework shifts the focus from rigid control to leveraging control compliance. It uses high-level movement intentions, allowing local adaptations to occur autonomously via reflex-like dynamic responses.

Result: The framework achieved stable, safe, and transferable behavior across soft robots with different morphologies and actuation mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness and cross-platform applicability.

Conclusion: Embracing control compliance, rather than adhering to rigid control paradigms, offers a promising, universal foundation for advancing soft robot control systems.

Abstract: Soft robotics has advanced rapidly, yet its control methods remain fragmented: different morphologies and actuation schemes still require task-specific controllers, hindering theoretical integration and large-scale deployment. A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes HAFO, a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework enabling robust locomotion and precise manipulation under strong external force interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in reinforcement learning controllers achieving robust motion and precise manipulation under strong force interactions.

Method: Introduces a coupled dual-agent RL framework, models external disturbances with spring-damper systems, and employs an asymmetric Actor-Critic architecture for training policies resistant to force disturbances.

Result: Experiments show HAFO's success in stable humanoid robot control during strong force interactions and rope tension disturbances.

Conclusion: HAFO enables robust and precise control in humanoid robots facing strong environmental forces, advancing reinforcement learning applications in robotics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning controllers have made impressive progress in humanoid locomotion and light load manipulation. However, achieving robust and precise motion with strong force interaction remains a significant challenge. Based on the above limitations, this paper proposes HAFO, a dual-agent reinforcement learning control framework that simultaneously optimizes both a robust locomotion strategy and a precise upper-body manipulation strategy through coupled training under external force interaction environments. Simultaneously, we explicitly model the external pulling disturbances through a spring-damper system and achieve fine-grained force control by manipulating the virtual spring. During this process, the reinforcement-learning policy spontaneously generates disturbance-rejection response by exploiting environmental feedback. Moreover, HAFO employs an asymmetric Actor-Critic framework in which the Critic-network access to privileged spring-damping forces guides the actor-network to learn a generalizable, robust policy for resisting external disturbances. The experimental results demonstrate that HAFO achieves stable control of humanoid robot under various strong force interactions, showing remarkable performance in load tasks and ensuring stable robot operation under rope tension disturbances.

*Dong Wang,Daniel Casado Herraez,Stefan May,Andreas Nüchter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic-ICP, a Doppler-aware framework for odometry in dynamic environments, improving stability and accuracy in LiDAR-based registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICP-based registration methods struggle in highly dynamic environments due to their reliance on near-static scenes and their inefficiency in repetitive or low-texture geometry.

Method: Dynamic-ICP uses per-point Doppler velocity for motion estimation and filtering, clusters dynamic objects, reconstructs their velocities, predicts movements using a velocity model, and aligns scans using a novel objective function combining geometry and Doppler data.

Result: Dynamic-ICP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in rotation stability and translation accuracy, operates in real-time, and integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines, as shown in three datasets: HeRCULES, HeLiPR, and AevaScenes.

Conclusion: Dynamic-ICP presents a reliable solution for LiDAR-based odometry in dynamic environments without requiring additional sensors or calibration, enabling real-time robust registration.

Abstract: Reliable odometry in highly dynamic environments remains challenging when it relies on ICP-based registration: ICP assumes near-static scenes and degrades in repetitive or low-texture geometry. We introduce Dynamic-ICP, a Doppler-aware registration framework. The method (i) estimates ego motion from per-point Doppler velocity via robust regression and builds a velocity filter, (ii) clusters dynamic objects and reconstructs object-wise translational velocities from ego-compensated radial measurements, (iii) predicts dynamic points with a constant-velocity model, and (iv) aligns scans using a compact objective that combines point-to-plane geometry residual with a translation-invariant, rotation-only Doppler residual. The approach requires no external sensors or sensor-vehicle calibration and operates directly on FMCW LiDAR range and Doppler velocities. We evaluate Dynamic-ICP on three datasets-HeRCULES, HeLiPR, AevaScenes-focusing on highly dynamic scenes. Dynamic-ICP consistently improves rotational stability and translation accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is also simple to integrate into existing pipelines, runs in real time, and provides a lightweight solution for robust registration in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: This paper investigates human-robot coordination during handover tasks using VR simulations, focusing on task dynamics and robot kinematics to optimize interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-robot collaboration is becoming more common in workplaces, necessitating an understanding of how to optimize interactions for smooth task performance.

Method: The study used VR-based robot handover simulations to test human motor performance across different robot motion profiles and interaction dynamics through controlled experiments.

Result: The study found that humans benefit from robots with smooth, human-like trajectories and early visual cues about object motion, improving synchronization and predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Human-robot interactions should highlight biological motion cues to enhance natural human predictive skills, reducing cognitive demand and robotic computational complexity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in robotics have increased the possibilities for integrating robotic systems into human-involved workplaces, highlighting the need to examine and optimize human-robot coordination in collaborative settings. This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the generalization challenges in long-horizon, multi-step articulated object manipulation across parts, instances, and categories.

Method: Developed ArtiBench to evaluate manipulation challenges; proposed ArtiBrain framework combining vision-language reasoning, hybrid control, and affordance memory for adaptive manipulation.

Result: ArtiBrain achieves superior robustness and generalization on the ArtiBench benchmark compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: ArtiBrain, supported by ArtiBench, represents a significant advancement in interactive articulated manipulation, promising better generalization and adaptability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Interactive articulated manipulation requires long-horizon, multi-step interactions with appliances while maintaining physical consistency. Existing vision-language and diffusion-based policies struggle to generalize across parts, instances, and categories. We first introduce ArtiBench, a five-level benchmark covering kitchen, storage, office, and tool environments. ArtiBench enables structured evaluation from cross-part and cross-instance variation to long-horizon multi-object tasks, revealing the core generalization challenges of articulated object manipulation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ArtiBrain, a modular framework that unifies high-level reasoning with adaptive low-level control. ArtiBrain uses a VLM-based Task Reasoner (GPT-4.1) to decompose and validate subgoals, and employs a Hybrid Controller that combines geometry-aware keyframe execution with affordance-guided diffusion for precise and interpretable manipulation. An Affordance Memory Bank continually accumulates successful execution episodes and propagates part-level actionable affordances to unseen articulated parts and configurations. Extensive experiments on ArtiBench show that our ArtiBrain significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and diffusion-based methods in robustness and generalization. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for tailored exploration planning in autonomous robots to meet diverse requirements, such as rapid data collection and detailed structural assessments.

Method: The study proposes a modular NBV planning framework using a Truncated Signed Distance field (TSDF) representation to adaptively select viewpoints based on user-defined objectives, ensuring informed exploration.

Result: The proposed method outperforms traditional NBV approaches in simulations, achieving better 3D map quality, efficient coverage, and path optimization.

Conclusion: The framework achieves user-aligned exploration and efficient mapping, confirming its applicability and superiority to conventional strategies.

Abstract: Reasons for mapping an unknown environment with autonomous robots are wide-ranging, but in practice, they are often overlooked when developing planning strategies. Rapid information gathering and comprehensive structural assessment of buildings have different requirements and therefore necessitate distinct methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel modular Next-Best-View (NBV) planning framework for aerial robots that explicitly uses a reconstruction quality objective to guide the exploration planning. In particular, our approach introduces new and efficient methods for view generation and selection of viewpoint candidates that are adaptive to the user-defined quality requirements, fully exploiting the uncertainty encoded in a Truncated Signed Distance field (TSDF) representation of the environment. This results in informed and efficient exploration decisions tailored towards the predetermined objective. Finally, we validate our method via extensive simulations in realistic environments. We demonstrate that it successfully adjusts its behavior to the user goal while consistently outperforming conventional NBV strategies in terms of coverage, quality of the final 3D map and path efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new optimization algorithm, MAWDO, which enhances path planning in dynamic environments by improving adaptability and stability, delivering smoother and more efficient trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of real-time adaptability in dynamic path planning for autonomous navigation under complex constraints.

Method: Introduces Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization (MAWDO), incorporating hierarchical-guidance mechanisms for balanced exploration and exploitation.

Result: MAWDO demonstrated superior performance in optimization benchmarks and dynamic path planning, reducing path length and optimality gap, with improved smoothness compared to existing methods (MEWDO, AWDO, and WDO).

Conclusion: MAWDO is an effective solution for real-time dynamic path planning, ensuring smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories with enhanced optimization capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, path planning has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing global search capability and convergence accuracy through heuristic and learning-inspired optimization frameworks. However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\%, 11.63\% and 14.93\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments.

Method: pNav integrates predictive modeling of power usage, real-time monitoring of navigation behavior, and coordination between AMR software and hardware components.

Result: Evaluation demonstrated pNav achieved over 96% power prediction accuracy and a 38.1% reduction in power consumption without compromising navigation accuracy or safety.

Conclusion: pNav effectively addresses CPS challenges in AMRs by enhancing energy efficiency and maintaining system reliability during operations.

Abstract: This paper presents pNav, a novel power-management system that significantly enhances the power/energy-efficiency of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) by jointly optimizing their physical/mechanical and cyber subsystems. By profiling AMRs' power consumption, we identify three challenges in achieving CPS (cyber-physical system) power-efficiency that involve both cyber (C) and physical (P) subsystems: (1) variabilities of system power consumption breakdown, (2) environment-aware navigation locality, and (3) coordination of C and P subsystems. pNav takes a multi-faceted approach to achieve power-efficiency of AMRs. First, it integrates millisecond-level power consumption prediction for both C and P subsystems. Second, it includes novel real-time modeling and monitoring of spatial and temporal navigation localities for AMRs. Third, it supports dynamic coordination of AMR software (navigation, detection) and hardware (motors, DVFS driver) configurations. pNav is prototyped using the Robot Operating System (ROS) Navigation Stack, 2D LiDAR, and camera. Our in-depth evaluation with a real robot and Gazebo environments demonstrates a >96% accuracy in predicting power consumption and a 38.1% reduction in power consumption without compromising navigation accuracy and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigid-body assumptions fail for flexible robotic systems with dynamically deforming structures. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing flexible system state estimation.

Method: The method uses an injective deformation-force model learned through a Multi-Layer Perceptron and integrates it with a B-spline kinematic model. The system applies Newton's Second Law for a connection between trajectory acceleration and deformation-induced acceleration.

Result: The proposed approach achieves accurate non-rigid pose estimation, introduces inertial sensing properties via platform physics, and resolves monocular visual odometry's metric scale and gravity recovery challenges.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends rigid-body pose estimation to non-rigid robotic systems, showing its feasibility and robustness through experiments on a spring-camera system.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation for flexible robotic systems poses significant challenges, particular for platforms with dynamically deforming structures that invalidate rigid-body assumptions. This paper tackles this problem and allows to extend existing rigid-body pose estimation methods to non-rigid systems. Our approach hinges on two core assumptions: first, the elastic properties are captured by an injective deformation-force model, efficiently learned via a Multi-Layer Perceptron; second, we solve the platform's inherently smooth motion using continuous-time B-spline kinematic models. By continuously applying Newton's Second Law, our method establishes a physical link between visually-derived trajectory acceleration and predicted deformation-induced acceleration. We demonstrate that our approach not only enables robust and accurate pose estimation on non-rigid platforms, but that the properly modeled platform physics instigate inertial sensing properties. We demonstrate this feasibility on a simple spring-camera system, and show how it robustly resolves the typically ill-posed problem of metric scale and gravity recovery in monocular visual odometry.

Result: GUARDIAN achieves 94-97% safety rates on EEG data with low test accuracies (27-46%) and high miscalibration (ECE: 0.22–0.41). It demonstrates robust performance in noise simulation and operates at high frequency and minimal latency.

Conclusion: GUARDIAN provides a robust, auditable, and practically viable framework for neural signal-controlled systems, ensuring traceable decisions and reliable robotic actions.

Abstract: Safety-critical assistive systems that directly decode user intent from neural signals require rigorous guarantees of reliability and trust. We present GUARDIAN (Gated Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Dual Invariants), a framework for real-time neuro-symbolic verification for neural signal-controlled robotics. GUARDIAN enforces both logical safety and physiological trust by coupling confidence-calibrated brain signal decoding with symbolic goal grounding and dual-layer runtime monitoring. On the BNCI2014 motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset with 9 subjects and 5,184 trials, the system performs at a high safety rate of 94-97% even with lightweight decoder architectures with low test accuracies (27-46%) and high ECE confidence miscalibration (0.22-0.41). We demonstrate 1.7x correct interventions in simulated noise testing versus at baseline. The monitor operates at 100Hz and sub-millisecond decision latency, making it practically viable for closed-loop neural signal-based systems. Across 21 ablation results, GUARDIAN exhibits a graduated response to signal degradation, and produces auditable traces from intent, plan to action, helping to link neural evidence to verifiable robot action.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProphRL, a new method for enhancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy training using a learned world model and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA policies are effective for aligning language, perception, and robotic actions, but suffer from overfitting in imitation training and struggle with distribution shifts. RL offers benefits but faces challenges like costly real-world interactions and difficulties in simulation engineering and transfer.

Method: The authors propose ProphRL, which includes Prophet, a pretrained action-to-video model for simulating reusable action dynamics, and FA-GRPO, a Flow-action gradient optimization tailored for VLA actions. FlowScale is also introduced for per-step gradient reweighting.

Result: ProphRL achieves significant improvements, with 5-17% success gains in benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots, demonstrating better efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: ProphRL presents an efficient solution for improving VLA policies by combining learned world models and tailored RL procedures, making it practical for various robotic scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies excel in aligning language, perception, and robot control. However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training. Experiments show 5-17% success gains on public benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots across different VLA variants.

Conclusion: Splatblox is effective in challenging, vegetation-rich scenarios, supporting long-range autonomous navigation with improved efficiency and reliability over current systems.

Abstract: We present Splatblox, a real-time system for autonomous navigation in outdoor environments with dense vegetation, irregular obstacles, and complex terrain. Our method fuses segmented RGB images and LiDAR point clouds using Gaussian Splatting to construct a traversability-aware Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) that jointly encodes geometry and semantics.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges and solutions for browser agents in ensuring safe and reliable web interaction, favoring specialized tools over general-purpose browsing intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical reliability and security challenges faced by browser agents in autonomous web interactions, emphasizing real-world limitations and safety challenges.

Method: The study involves security analysis of production browser agents, hybrid context management integrating accessibility tree snapshots with selective vision, and intelligent prompt engineering.

Result: The agent achieved about an 85% success rate on the WebGames benchmark across 53 challenges, surpassing the approximate 50% success of previous agents but below the 95.7% human baseline.

Conclusion: The paper proposes focusing on specialized, programmatically constrained tools instead of general-purpose AI browsing, arguing for safety enforced via code rather than LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Browser agents enable autonomous web interaction but face critical reliability and security challenges in production. This paper presents findings from building and operating a production browser agent. The analysis examines where current approaches fail and what prevents safe autonomous operation. The fundamental insight: model capability does not limit agent performance; architectural decisions determine success or failure. Security analysis of real-world incidents reveals prompt injection attacks make general-purpose autonomous operation fundamentally unsafe. The paper argues against developing general browsing intelligence in favor of specialized tools with programmatic constraints, where safety boundaries are enforced through code instead of large language model (LLM) reasoning. Through hybrid context management combining accessibility tree snapshots with selective vision, comprehensive browser tooling matching human interaction capabilities, and intelligent prompt engineering, the agent achieved approximately 85% success rate on the WebGames benchmark across 53 diverse challenges (compared to approximately 50% reported for prior browser agents and 95.7% human baseline).

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in effectively and efficiently matching tools to functionalities in enterprise-level MCP services due to issues like semantic disconnection and high inference latency.

Method: The Z-Space framework utilizes multi-agent collaboration with structured intent parsing, a fused subspace weighted algorithm for tool filtering, and an inference execution agent for dynamic planning and fault-tolerant execution.

Conclusion: The Z-Space framework significantly enhances the practicality of MCP systems by addressing key challenges related to tool matching and execution, as demonstrated in large-scale enterprise applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models can break through knowledge and timeliness limitations by invoking external tools within the Model Context Protocol framework to achieve automated execution of complex tasks. However, with the rapid growth of enterprise-scale MCP services, efficiently and accurately matching target functionalities among thousands of heterogeneous tools has become a core challenge restricting system practicality. Existing approaches generally rely on full-prompt injection or static semantic retrieval, facing issues including semantic disconnection between user queries and tool descriptions, context inflation in LLM input, and high inference latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Z-Space, a data-generation-oriented multi-agent collaborative tool invocation framework Z-Space. The Z-Space framework establishes a multi-agent collaborative architecture and tool filtering algorithm: (1) A structured semantic understanding of user queries is achieved through an intent parsing model; (2) A tool filtering module (FSWW) based on fused subspace weighted algorithm realizes fine-grained semantic alignment between intents and tools without parameter tuning; (3) An inference execution agent is constructed to support dynamic planning and fault-tolerant execution for multi-step tasks. This framework has been deployed in the Eleme platform's technical division, serving large-scale test data generation scenarios across multiple business units including Taotian, Gaode, and Hema. Production data demonstrates that the system reduces average token consumption in tool inference by 96.26\% while achieving a 92\% tool invocation accuracy rate, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of intelligent test data generation systems.

*Randall Balestriero,Hugues Van Assel,Sami BuGhanem,Lucas Maes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces stable-pretraining, a flexible and scalable library designed to simplify self-supervised learning research and foundation model experimentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges such as complex codebases, redundant tool implementations, and engineering difficulties in self-supervised learning and foundation model research.

Method: The stable-pretraining library integrates utilities like probes, collapse detection, augmentation pipelines, and evaluation routines. It emphasizes modular, extensible design and fine-grained training dynamic logging to support debugging and reproducibility.

Result: The library supports new insights, such as depthwise representation probing and analysis of CLIP's performance under synthetic data fine-tuning, with minimal engineering overhead.

Conclusion: Stable-pretraining lowers the entry barriers for SSL and foundation model research while remaining scalable, fostering accelerated discoveries in AI.

Abstract: Foundation models and self-supervised learning (SSL) have become central to modern AI, yet research in this area remains hindered by complex codebases, redundant re-implementations, and the heavy engineering burden of scaling experiments. We present stable-pretraining, a modular, extensible, and performance-optimized library built on top of PyTorch, Lightning, Hugging Face, and TorchMetrics. Unlike prior toolkits focused narrowly on reproducing state-of-the-art results, stable-pretraining is designed for flexibility and iteration speed: it unifies essential SSL utilities--including probes, collapse detection metrics, augmentation pipelines, and extensible evaluation routines--within a coherent and reliable framework. A central design principle is logging everything, enabling fine-grained visibility into training dynamics that makes debugging, monitoring, and reproducibility seamless. We validate the library by demonstrating its ability to generate new research insights with minimal overhead, including depthwise representation probing and the analysis of CLIP degradation under synthetic data finetuning. By lowering barriers to entry while remaining scalable to large experiments, stable-pretraining aims to accelerate discovery and expand the possibilities of foundation model research.

*Zhe Zhao,Yuheng Yang,Haibin Wen,Xiaojie Qiu,Zaixi Zhang,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces MADE (Multi-Agent Decomposed Evolution), a framework that enables evolutionary optimization through subjective evaluation using LLMs, achieving significant improvements on complex benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the constraint of evolutionary computation being bound by an objective, machine-computable fitness function, and explore the possibility of evolution thriving in subjective landscapes evaluated by LLMs.

Method: The paper proposes MADE, which converts vague subjective evaluations by LLMs into measurable, stable feedback by decomposing instructions into specific sub-requirements, thus mitigating noise and creating precise selection pressure.

Result: MADE outperformed baselines by over 50% in software requirement satisfaction and achieved a 95% perfect pass rate for complex instruction following.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a shift from optimizing computable metrics to describable qualities, opening up possibilities for evolutionary algorithms to operate in open-ended domains lacking ground truth.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Computation (EC) has unlocked new frontiers in scientific discovery but remains shackled by a fundamental constraint: the reliance on an Oracle--an objective, machine-computable fitness function. This paper breaks this barrier by asking: Can evolution thrive in a purely subjective landscape governed solely by LLM judges? We introduce MADE (Multi-Agent Decomposed Evolution), a framework that tames the inherent noise of subjective evaluation through "Problem Specification." By decomposing vague instructions into specific, verifiable sub-requirements, MADE transforms high-variance LLM feedback into stable, precise selection pressure. The results are transformative: across complex benchmarks like DevAI and InfoBench, MADE outperforms strong baselines by over 50% in software requirement satisfaction (39.9% to 61.9%) and achieves a 95% perfect pass rate on complex instruction following. This work validates a fundamental paradigm shift: moving from optimizing "computable metrics" to "describable qualities," thereby unlocking evolutionary optimization for the vast open-ended domains where no ground truth exists.

*Asif Zaman,Kallol Naha,Khalid Belhajjame,Hasan M. Jamil*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeR$^3$, a generative AI-based system to revive and migrate decayed scientific workflows into modern technologies such as Snakemake and VisFlow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of decayed workflows in legacy systems like Taverna, which become unusable due to discontinued services, obsolete dependencies, and system retirement.

Method: The proposed system, CodeR$^3$, employs generative AI for analyzing decayed workflows, incorporates stepwise workflow visualization, automates service substitution, and includes human-in-the-loop validation to migrate workflows to modern platforms.

Result: Case studies demonstrate that CodeR$^3$ reduces manual effort in parsing and identifying services in workflows but highlights that service substitution and data validation still necessitate domain expertise.

Conclusion: CodeR$^3$ presents a balanced framework for automation while emphasizing the need for human judgment, enabling collaborative revival and validation of workflows through a community-oriented platform.

Abstract: Scientific workflows encode valuable domain expertise and computational methodologies. Yet studies consistently show that a significant proportion of published workflows suffer from decay over time. This problem is particularly acute for legacy workflow systems like Taverna, where discontinued services, obsolete dependencies, and system retirement render previously functional workflows unusable. We present a novel legacy workflow migration system, called CodeR$^3$ (stands for Code Repair, Revival and Reuse), that leverages generative AI to analyze the characteristics of decayed workflows, reproduce them into modern workflow technologies like Snakemake and VisFlow. Our system additionally integrates stepwise workflow analysis visualization, automated service substitution, and human-in-the-loop validation. Through several case studies of Taverna workflow revival, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach while identifying key challenges that require human oversight. Our findings reveal that automation significantly reduces manual effort in workflow parsing and service identification. However, critical tasks such as service substitution and data validation still require domain expertise. Our result will be a crowdsourcing platform that enables the community to collaboratively revive decayed workflows and validate the functionality and correctness of revived workflows. This work contributes a framework for workflow revival that balances automation efficiency with necessary human judgment.

*Abhi Chivukula,Jay Somasundaram,Vijay Somasundaram*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Agint is a tool for transforming natural language instructions into reliable and scalable executable graphs through a combination of advanced compiler methods and interactive interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges faced by LLM-based coding agents including context management, latency, reliability, reproducibility, and scalability.

Method: Agint uses hierarchical compilation, semantic graph transformations, and a hybrid runtime combining LLMs and function-based JIT execution. It introduces tools like dagify, dagent, schemagin, and datagin.

Result: Agint improves reliability, scalability, context utilization, and throughput while enabling reproducible and optimized graph execution alongside concurrent development workflows.

Conclusion: Agint bridges natural language, compiler techniques, and coding workflows, allowing human and coding agents to collaboratively create scalable, reliable, and efficient codebases.

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are increasingly common but still face challenges in context management, latency, reliability, reproducibility, and scalability. We present Agint, an agentic graph compiler, interpreter, and runtime that incrementally and hierarchically converts natural-language instructions into typed, effect-aware code DAGs. Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput. Hierarchical compilation allows scalable graph edits, while the graph structure supports reproducibility and efficient parallel generation. Agint provides a composable unix-style toolchain: dagify (DAG compiler), dagent (hybrid JIT runtime), schemagin (schema generator), and datagin (data transformer) for realtime, low-latency code and dataflow creation. Human developers and coding agents refine graphs through the Agint CLI, while non-technical users use Agint Flow GUI for visual editing, conversational refinement, and debugging to promote prototype agentic workflows to production code. This continuous co-creation model allows teams to prototype quickly, refine seamlessly, and deploy reliably, bridging natural language, compiler methods, and developer tooling to enable a new generation of composable, team-centric coding agents at scale.

### [451] [CodeFuse-CommitEval: Towards Benchmarking LLM's Power on Commit Message and Code Change Inconsistency Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19875)
*Qingyu Zhang,Puzhuo Liu,Peng Di,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study addresses the issue of message-code inconsistency (MCI) in commit messages and introduces CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark for evaluating MCI detection using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commit messages often fail to align with their associated code changes, causing problems in maintenance, review, security, and data quality. There lacked a benchmark for assessing how well models detect these inconsistencies.

Method: A diverse and high-quality dataset was built on ApacheCM, generating seven inconsistency types via rule-guided mutations. The benchmark was validated for sample quality and used to evaluate LLMs with standard and augmented strategies like few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context.

Result: LLMs showed higher performance in detecting inconsistent commits than consistent ones. Gpt-oss-20B performed best in accuracy but consumed more tokens. Augmentation strategies had varied impacts: few-shot improved accuracy but created incorrect predictions, and chain-of-thought enhanced precision despite lower recall.

Conclusion: CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL establishes a benchmark to measure MCI detection rigorously, emphasizing the importance of rich context and balanced data to address high-level semantic gaps in commit messages.

Abstract: Version control relies on commit messages to convey the rationale for code changes, but these messages are often low quality and, more critically, inconsistent with their diffs-known as message-code inconsistency (MCI). MCIs mislead reviewers, hinder maintenance, contaminate research datasets, and may obscure security patches. Yet, no dedicated benchmark exists to evaluate models for MCI detection. We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level "purpose" inconsistencies. CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL provides a rigorous foundation for measuring, comparing, and advancing MCI detection, highlighting the need for richer context and balanced data to capture high-level semantic gaps.

### [452] [Translating Large-Scale C Repositories to Idiomatic Rust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20617)
*Saman Dehghan,Tianran Sun,Tianxiang Wu,Zihan Li,Reyhaneh Jabbarvand*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Rustine is an automated pipeline for translating C code to idiomatic and safe Rust code, achieving high functional equivalence and readability compared to previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for translating C to Rust either lack in code quality or are not scalable due to high costs, necessitating a more effective and scalable solution.

Method: Rustine automates the translation of C programs to Rust by creating idiomatic and safe Rust code, while ensuring functional equivalence via tests and human-assisted debugging support.

Result: Rustine successfully generated compilable Rust code for 23 C programs, achieving 87% functional equivalence, and performed better in safety, idiomaticity, and readability compared to previous techniques.

Conclusion: Rustine makes repository-level C to Rust translation scalable and efficient, helping developers create safer and more idiomatic Rust code with minimal effort.

Abstract: Existing C to Rust translation techniques fail to balance quality and scalability: transpilation-based approaches scale to large projects but produce code with poor safety, idiomaticity, and readability. In contrast, LLM-based techniques are prohibitively expensive due to their reliance on frontier models (without which they cannot reliably generate compilable translations), thus limiting scalability. This paper proposes Rustine, a fully automated pipeline for effective and efficient repository-level C to idiomatic safe Rust translation. Evaluating on a diverse set of 23 C programs, ranging from 27 to 13,200 lines of code, Rustine can generate fully compilable Rust code for all and achieve 87% functional equivalence (passing 1,063,099 assertions out of 1,221,192 in test suites with average function and line coverage of 74.7% and 72.2%). Compared to six prior repository-level C to Rust translation techniques, the translations by Rustine are overall safer (fewer raw pointers, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe constructs), more idiomatic (fewer Rust linter violations), and more readable. When the translations cannot pass all tests to fulfill functional equivalence, human developers were able to complete the task in 4.5 hours, on average, using Rustine as debugging support.

*Andrea Lops,Fedelucio Narducci,Azzurra Ragone,Michelantonio Trizio,Claudio Barto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents AgoneTest, a framework for evaluating LLM-generated unit tests in Java, using advanced metrics under realistic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unit testing is resource-intensive. Researchers need tools to assess the quality of LLM-generated tests effectively, which can guide improvements in LLMs and testing practices.

Method: The paper introduces AgoneTest, a framework paired with the Classes2Test dataset. It evaluates LLM-generated tests using realistic conditions and advanced metrics, such as mutation scores and test smells.

Result: Experimental results indicate that LLM-generated tests can rival human-written tests in terms of coverage and defect detection for compiling subsets. Enhanced prompting strategies improve test quality.

Conclusion: AgoneTest showcases the utility of LLMs in unit testing and provides guidance for better testing practices, LLM models, and prompt strategies.

Abstract: Unit testing is an essential but resource-intensive step in software development, ensuring individual code units function correctly. This paper introduces AgoneTest, an automated evaluation framework for Large Language Model-generated (LLM) unit tests in Java. AgoneTest does not aim to propose a novel test generation algorithm; rather, it supports researchers and developers in comparing different LLMs and prompting strategies through a standardized end-to-end evaluation pipeline under realistic conditions. We introduce the Classes2Test dataset, which maps Java classes under test to their corresponding test classes, and a framework that integrates advanced evaluation metrics, such as mutation score and test smells, for a comprehensive assessment. Experimental results show that, for the subset of tests that compile, LLM-generated tests can match or exceed human-written tests in terms of coverage and defect detection. Our findings also demonstrate that enhanced prompting strategies contribute to test quality. AgoneTest clarifies the potential of LLMs in software testing and offers insights for future improvements in model design, prompt engineering, and testing practices.

### [454] [Human-computer interactions predict mental health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20179)
*Veith Weilnhammer,Jefferson Ortega,David Whitney*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study presents MAILA, a machine-learning framework that uses human-computer interactions to assess mental health. It leverages cursor and touchscreen data from a large population to predict mental states dynamically and at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental illness is a major cause of disability, and scalable assessments for mental health remain challenging. The authors aim to develop a reliable and accessible technology-driven solution for mental health evaluations.

Method: MAILA was trained using over 1.3 million self-reported mental-health assessments from 20,000 digital interaction recordings. It incorporates data longitudinally, including diagnoses of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Result: MAILA effectively tracks mental states across dimensions, generalizes across contexts, achieves high accuracy for group-level predictions, and identifies individuals with mental illness. It also uncovers psychological markers beyond what language can provide.

Conclusion: Human-computer interactions can facilitate scalable, affordable, and dynamic mental health assessments, setting new benchmarks for precision medicine. However, this advancement prompts ethical considerations regarding privacy and autonomy online.

Abstract: Scalable assessments of mental illness, the leading driver of disability worldwide, remain a critical roadblock toward accessible and equitable care. Here, we show that human-computer interactions encode multiple dimensions of self-reported mental health and their changes over time.
  We introduce MAILA, a MAchine-learning framework for Inferring Latent mental states from digital Activity. We trained MAILA to predict 1.3 million mental-health self-reports from 20,000 cursor and touchscreen recordings recorded in 9,000 online participants. The dataset includes 2,000 individuals assessed longitudinally, 1,500 diagnosed with depression, and 500 with obsessive-compulsive disorder. MAILA tracks dynamic mental states along three orthogonal dimensions, generalizes across contexts, and achieves near-ceiling accuracy when predicting group-level mental health. The model translates from general to clinical populations, identifies individuals living with mental illness, and captures signatures of psychological function that are not conveyed by language.
  Our results demonstrate how everyday human-computer interactions can power passive, reliable, dynamic, and maximally scalable mental health assessments. The ability to decode mental states at zero marginal cost sets new benchmarks for precision medicine and public health, while raising important questions about privacy, agency, and autonomy online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose tracking methods only provide indirect insights into neural control processes during movement.

Method: MIMIC-MJX learns neural control policies by training controllers to actuate biomechanical body models in physics simulations.

Result: MIMIC-MJX is accurate, fast, data-efficient, and adaptable to various animal models.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates neural control analysis and simulates behavioral experiments, promoting neuroscience modeling.

Abstract: The primary output of the nervous system is movement and behavior. While recent advances have democratized pose tracking during complex behavior, kinematic trajectories alone provide only indirect access to the underlying control processes. Here we present MIMIC-MJX, a framework for learning biologically-plausible neural control policies from kinematics. MIMIC-MJX models the generative process of motor control by training neural controllers that learn to actuate biomechanically-realistic body models in physics simulation to reproduce real kinematic trajectories. We demonstrate that our implementation is accurate, fast, data-efficient, and generalizable to diverse animal body models. Policies trained with MIMIC-MJX can be utilized to both analyze neural control strategies and simulate behavioral experiments, illustrating its potential as an integrative modeling framework for neuroscience.

### [456] [FAST: Topology-Aware Frequency-Domain Distribution Matching for Coreset Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19476)
*Jin Cui,Boran Zhao,Jiajun Xu,Jiaqi Guo,Shuo Guan,Pengju Ren*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAST, a DNN-free coreset selection framework that optimizes coreset selection by leveraging spectral graph theory and a novel distance metric in the frequency domain, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and shortcomings of existing coreset selection methods, which either rely on model-specific biases or lack theoretical robustness, and to ensure distributional equivalence in dataset compression.

Method: FAST formulates coreset selection as a graph-constrained optimization problem using spectral graph theory. It employs a new Attenuated Phase-Decoupled Characteristic Function Distance and a Progressive Discrepancy-Aware Sampling strategy to improve accuracy and convergence.

Result: FAST outperforms other baseline coreset selection methods with a 9.12% average accuracy gain. It also reduces power consumption by 96.57% and achieves a 2.2x average speedup.

Conclusion: FAST demonstrates significant improvements in both accuracy and energy efficiency for coreset selection, setting a new standard for dataset compression methods while maintaining theoretical robustness.

Abstract: Coreset selection compresses large datasets into compact, representative subsets, reducing the energy and computational burden of training deep neural networks. Existing methods are either: (i) DNN-based, which are tied to model-specific parameters and introduce architectural bias; or (ii) DNN-free, which rely on heuristics lacking theoretical guarantees. Neither approach explicitly constrains distributional equivalence, largely because continuous distribution matching is considered inapplicable to discrete sampling. Moreover, prevalent metrics (e.g., MSE, KL, MMD, CE) cannot accurately capture higher-order moment discrepancies, leading to suboptimal coresets. In this work, we propose FAST, the first DNN-free distribution-matching coreset selection framework that formulates the coreset selection task as a graph-constrained optimization problem grounded in spectral graph theory and employs the Characteristic Function Distance (CFD) to capture full distributional information in the frequency domain. We further discover that naive CFD suffers from a "vanishing phase gradient" issue in medium and high-frequency regions; to address this, we introduce an Attenuated Phase-Decoupled CFD. Furthermore, for better convergence, we design a Progressive Discrepancy-Aware Sampling strategy that progressively schedules frequency selection from low to high, preserving global structure before refining local details and enabling accurate matching with fewer frequencies while avoiding overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coreset selection methods across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy gain of 9.12%. Compared to other baseline coreset methods, it reduces power consumption by 96.57% and achieves a 2.2x average speedup, underscoring its high performance and energy efficiency.

*Jared N. Lakhani,Etienne Pienaar*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of a two-block MCMC framework's effectiveness due to excessive likelihood sharpness, with empirical results in reinforcement learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how likelihood sharpness affects the performance of two-block MCMC frameworks and to explore this in various use cases, including reinforcement learning tasks.

Method: They introduce a sharpness parameter in the likelihood formulation, analyze its impact on MCMC performance, and test it on reinforcement learning tasks such as navigation and tic-tac-toe, as well as a blackjack optimization problem.

Result: The study identifies that extreme likelihood sharpness collapses posterior mass onto a single mode, rendering data-driven regularization ineffective.

Conclusion: Excessive likelihood sharpness in MCMC frameworks hinders performance as it limits the framework's ability to generalize effectively.

Abstract: This study investigates the limitations of applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to arbitrary objective functions, focusing on a two-block MCMC framework which alternates between Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling. While such approaches are often considered advantageous for enabling data-driven regularization, we show that their performance critically depends on the sharpness of the employed likelihood form. By introducing a sharpness parameter and exploring alternative likelihood formulations proportional to the target objective function, we demonstrate how likelihood curvature governs both in-sample performance and the degree of regularization inferred by the training data. Empirical applications are conducted on reinforcement learning tasks: including a navigation problem and the game of tic-tac-toe. The study concludes with a separate analysis examining the implications of extreme likelihood sharpness on arbitrary objective functions stemming from the classic game of blackjack, where the first block of the two-block MCMC framework is replaced with an iterative optimization step. The resulting hybrid approach achieves performance nearly identical to the original MCMC framework, indicating that excessive likelihood sharpness effectively collapses posterior mass onto a single dominant mode.

*Badih Ghattas,Alvaro Sanchez San-Benito*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper compares clustering methods for mixed-type data using various simulation models and identifies KAMILA, LCM, and k-prototypes as the best performers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering mixed-type data is challenging due to the variety of variable types in datasets, and the study seeks to evaluate existing methods' effectiveness.

Method: Six clustering methods, including distance-based and probabilistic approaches, were assessed using simulation models with varying experimental factors.

Result: The degree of cluster overlap, proportion of continuous variables, and sample size significantly affected performances, with KAMILA, LCM, and k-prototypes showing the best performance based on ARI.

Conclusion: No method provided satisfactory results in cases of strong variable interactions with cluster dependence. However, KAMILA, LCM, and k-prototypes had the best overall performance across scenarios.

Abstract: Clustering is widely used in unsupervised learning to find homogeneous groups of observations within a dataset. However, clustering mixed-type data remains a challenge, as few existing approaches are suited for this task. This study presents the state-of-the-art of these approaches and compares them using various simulation models. The compared methods include the distance-based approaches k-prototypes, PDQ, and convex k-means, and the probabilistic methods KAy-means for MIxed LArge data (KAMILA), the mixture of Bayesian networks (MBNs), and latent class model (LCM). The aim is to provide insights into the behavior of different methods across a wide range of scenarios by varying some experimental factors such as the number of clusters, cluster overlap, sample size, dimension, proportion of continuous variables in the dataset, and clusters' distribution. The degree of cluster overlap and the proportion of continuous variables in the dataset and the sample size have a significant impact on the observed performances. When strong interactions exist between variables alongside an explicit dependence on cluster membership, none of the evaluated methods demonstrated satisfactory performance. In our experiments KAMILA, LCM, and k-prototypes exhibited the best performance, with respect to the adjusted rand index (ARI). All the methods are available in R.

*Afra Kilic,Kim Batselier*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents Bayesian Tensor Network Volterra kernel machines (BTN-V) to model nonlinear systems more efficiently and accurately by reducing model complexity and adding uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the exponential growth in complexity when using Volterra series to model nonlinear systems and improve interpretability, computational efficiency, and uncertainty estimation.

Method: The paper introduces BTN-V, leveraging canonical polyadic decomposition to represent Volterra kernels more efficiently while using Bayesian methods with sparsity-inducing priors for rank determination and memory behavior learning.

Result: Empirical results show that BTN-V achieves competitive accuracy, better uncertainty quantification, and reduced computational costs compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: BTN-V provides an efficient, interpretable, and computationally feasible solution for Volterra system identification, with added benefits like predictive uncertainty estimation and automatic complexity control.

Abstract: Modeling nonlinear systems with Volterra series is challenging because the number of kernel coefficients grows exponentially with the model order. This work introduces Bayesian Tensor Network Volterra kernel machines (BTN-V), extending the Bayesian Tensor Network framework to Volterra system identification. BTN-V represents Volterra kernels using canonical polyadic decomposition, reducing model complexity from O(I^D) to O(DIR). By treating all tensor components and hyperparameters as random variables, BTN-V provides predictive uncertainty estimation at no additional computational cost. Sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors enable automatic rank determination and the learning of fading-memory behavior directly from data, improving interpretability and preventing overfitting. Empirical results demonstrate competitive accuracy, enhanced uncertainty quantification, and reduced computational cost.

*Rui Tong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Continuum Percolation as a tool for generative modeling to analyze data manifold topology, ensuring structural fidelity without relying solely on statistical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of statistical metrics in capturing structural pathologies like implicit mode collapse in generative models.

Method: The authors establish an isomorphism between Random Geometric Graph topological transitions and data manifold structure, introducing a Percolation Shift metric, and leveraging it as a differentiable loss function for training.

Result: Experimental results confirm that the method prevents manifold shrinkage, achieves fidelity, and encourages topological expansion, promoting "Hyper-Generalization."

Conclusion: The approach offers significant improvements in generative modeling by aligning topology analysis with fidelity metrics, overcoming limitations of current statistical evaluations.

Abstract: Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of "Hyper-Generalization," achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs) for causal inference in spatio-temporal data, addressing challenges with unobserved confounders. It proposes a theoretical foundation and validates its effectiveness using synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address causal inference challenges within spatio-temporal data, especially when unobserved confounders affect outcomes across time and geographical units.

Method: The authors propose ST-HCMs, a hierarchical graphical framework combined with the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem to simplify causal models as data increases, enabling causal identification despite unobserved parameters.

Result: The framework is validated using synthetic and real-world datasets, showing its capability to recover causal effects even with time-invariant unit-level unobserved confounders.

Conclusion: ST-HCMs offer a robust solution for causal inference in dynamic, spatio-temporal systems, overcoming limitations of standard models under specific confounding conditions.

Abstract: The abundance of fine-grained spatio-temporal data, such as traffic sensor networks, offers vast opportunities for scientific discovery. However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems.

### [462] [Individual and group fairness in geographical partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19722)
*Ilya O. Ryzhov,John Gunnar Carlsson,Yinchu Zhu*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to address socioeconomic segregation in geographical partitioning by ensuring fair representation for diverse groups, leveraging a novel computational algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Socioeconomic segregation can lead to unequal representation across districts, impacting opportunities and outcomes. A solution is needed to ensure fairness in geographical partitioning.

Method: The authors introduce a class of partitioning problems using a generalization of the additively weighted Voronoi diagram and propose an efficient algorithm to compute the solution.

Result: They provide proof of the optimal solution and apply the method to a realistic case study with multiple demographic groups and district offices.

Conclusion: This approach resolves a longstanding question from 1951 and demonstrates practical utility in addressing representation disparities in districting.

Abstract: Socioeconomic segregation often arises in school districting and other contexts, causing some groups to be over- or under-represented within a particular district. This phenomenon is closely linked with disparities in opportunities and outcomes. We formulate a new class of geographical partitioning problems in which the population is heterogeneous, and it is necessary to ensure fair representation for each group at each facility. We prove that the optimal solution is a novel generalization of the additively weighted Voronoi diagram, and we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to compute it, thus resolving an open question dating back to Dvoretzky et al. (1951). The efficacy and potential for practical insight of the approach are demonstrated in a realistic case study involving seven demographic groups and $78$ district offices.

### [464] [Solving Heterogeneous Agent Models with Physics-informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20283)
*Marta Grzeskiewicz*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) based solver for household behavior models in macroeconomics, addressing computational challenges in traditional numerical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses computational inefficiencies in modeling household behavior using heterogeneous agent models, particularly the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett (ABH) framework, in continuous time.

Method: Introduces the ABH-PINN solver, which incorporates Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov Forward equations into neural network training, replacing grid-based solvers with mesh-free PINN approaches.

Result: Preliminary results show that the PINN-based solver achieves economically valid results comparable to traditional methods like finite-difference solvers.

Conclusion: The ABH-PINN approach offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate alternative for solving continuous-time household behavior models.

Abstract: Understanding household behaviour is essential for modelling macroeconomic dynamics and designing effective policy. While heterogeneous agent models offer a more realistic alternative to representative agent frameworks, their implementation poses significant computational challenges, particularly in continuous time. The Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett (ABH) framework, recast as a system of partial differential equations, typically relies on grid-based solvers that suffer from the curse of dimensionality, high computational cost, and numerical inaccuracies. This paper introduces the ABH-PINN solver, an approach based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which embeds the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov Forward equations directly into the neural network training objective. By replacing grid-based approximation with mesh-free, differentiable function learning, the ABH-PINN solver benefits from the advantages of PINNs of improved scalability, smoother solutions, and computational efficiency. Preliminary results show that the PINN-based approach is able to obtain economically valid results matching the established finite-difference solvers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysDNet, a physics-guided multi-branch network for more robust side-scan sonar image analysis by decomposing images into interpretable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSS imagery is influenced by multiple factors making it view-dependent and challenging for robust analysis. The paper aims to address this challenge.

Method: PhysDNet uses the Lambertian reflection model to decouple SSS images into seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and propagation loss. It employs self-supervised training without ground-truth data.

Result: Experiments confirmed that PhysDNet achieved stable geological structure preservation, consistent illumination handling, accurate attenuation representation, and reliable shadow maps.

Conclusion: Physics-guided decomposition via PhysDNet enhances interpretability and robustness in SSS imagery analysis, benefiting tasks like shadow interpretation and image registration.

Abstract: Side-scan sonar (SSS) imagery is widely used for seafloor mapping and underwater remote sensing, yet the measured intensity is strongly influenced by seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss. This entanglement makes the imagery highly view-dependent and reduces the robustness of downstream analysis. In this letter, we present PhysDNet, a physics-guided multi-branch network that decouples SSS images into three interpretable fields: seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and propagation loss. By embedding the Lambertian reflection model, PhysDNet reconstructs sonar intensity from these components, enabling self-supervised training without ground-truth annotations. Experiments show that the decomposed representations preserve stable geological structures, capture physically consistent illumination and attenuation, and produce reliable shadow maps. These findings demonstrate that physics-guided decomposition provides a stable and interpretable domain for SSS analysis, improving both physical consistency and downstream tasks such as registration and shadow interpretation.

*Jinyu Liu,Gang Tan,Kiwan Maeng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CrypTorch is a compiler designed to optimize MPC-based machine learning by improving the performance and accuracy of approximations for operations like Softmax and GELU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC-based ML struggles with inefficiencies and inaccuracies in approximating operations necessary for machine learning, leading to performance bottlenecks in existing frameworks.

Method: CrypTorch uses a disentangled compiler approach, enabling the addition of new approximations and automatic selection for maximum performance and accuracy.

Result: CrypTorch delivers significant speedups: 1.20--1.7× without accuracy loss, 1.31--1.8× allowing minor accuracy degradation, and 3.22--8.6× end-to-end compared to CrypTen.

Conclusion: CrypTorch improves both performance and accuracy for MPC-based machine learning, addressing bottlenecks and outperforming existing frameworks like CrypTen.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) involves private data and proprietary model parameters. MPC-based ML allows multiple parties to collaboratively run an ML workload without sharing their private data or model parameters using multi-party computing (MPC). Because MPC cannot natively run ML operations such as Softmax or GELU, existing frameworks use different approximations. Our study shows that, on a well-optimized framework, these approximations often become the dominating bottleneck. Popular approximations are often insufficiently accurate or unnecessarily slow, and these issues are hard to identify and fix in existing frameworks. To tackle this issue, we propose a compiler for MPC-based ML, CrypTorch. CrypTorch disentangles these approximations with the rest of the MPC runtime, allows easily adding new approximations through its programming interface, and automatically selects approximations to maximize both performance and accuracy. Built as an extension to PyTorch 2's compiler, we show that CrypTorch's auto-tuning alone provides 1.20--1.7$\times$ immediate speedup without sacrificing accuracy, and 1.31--1.8$\times$ speedup when some accuracy degradation is allowed, compared to our well-optimized baseline. Combined with better engineering and adoption of state-of-the-art practices, the entire framework brings 3.22--8.6$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the popular framework, CrypTen.

*Yixin Wu,Rui Wen,Chi Cui,Michael Backes,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AttackPilot, an autonomous agent for performing inference attacks efficiently, showing high performance with low cost using GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference attacks are a critical way to assess risks in ML services, yet they are complex and not easily executable by non-experts. Autonomous tools are required to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors created AttackPilot, an autonomous agent powered by large language models such as GPT-4o, designed to independently carry out inference attacks and optimize strategies under constraints.

Result: AttackPilot achieved a task completion rate of 100% and demonstrated near-expert performance, with low-cost operations at $0.627 per run, while also showing adaptability across different LLMs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of LLM-powered autonomous agents to make inference attack assessments accessible to non-experts, improving systematic risk evaluation for ML services.

Abstract: Inference attacks have been widely studied and offer a systematic risk assessment of ML services; however, their implementation and the attack parameters for optimal estimation are challenging for non-experts. The emergence of advanced large language models presents a promising yet largely unexplored opportunity to develop autonomous agents as inference attack experts, helping address this challenge. In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations. We anticipate that such agents could empower non-expert ML service providers, auditors, or regulators to systematically assess the risks of ML services without requiring deep domain expertise.

### [468] [SPQR: A Standardized Benchmark for Modern Safety Alignment Methods in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19558)
*Mohammed Talha Alam,Nada Saadi,Fahad Shamshad,Nils Lukas,Karthik Nandakumar,Fahkri Karray,Samuele Poppi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the instability of safety in text-to-image (T2I) models under benign fine-tuning and introduces SPQR, a benchmark to evaluate safety adherence and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models fail to maintain safety alignment when benign fine-tuning techniques are applied post-deployment.

Method: The authors developed the SPQR benchmark to evaluate safety, utility, and robustness of T2I models under fine-tuning using a single-comprehensive score for standardized comparisons.

Result: SPQR reveals frequent failures in current safety methods post fine-tuning and offers detailed category-based analyses to pinpoint failure scenarios.

Conclusion: SPQR is an effective benchmarking tool for assessing T2I safety, enabling improved model evaluation under various fine-tuning and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can emit copyrighted, unsafe, or private content. Safety alignment aims to suppress specific concepts, yet evaluations seldom test whether safety persists under benign downstream fine-tuning routinely applied after deployment (e.g., LoRA personalization, style/domain adapters). We study the stability of current safety methods under benign fine-tuning and observe frequent breakdowns. As true safety alignment must withstand even benign post-deployment adaptations, we introduce the SPQR benchmark (Safety-Prompt adherence-Quality-Robustness). SPQR is a single-scored metric that provides a standardized and reproducible framework to evaluate how well safety-aligned diffusion models preserve safety, utility, and robustness under benign fine-tuning, by reporting a single leaderboard score to facilitate comparisons. We conduct multilingual, domain-specific, and out-of-distribution analyses, along with category-wise breakdowns, to identify when safety alignment fails after benign fine-tuning, ultimately showcasing SPQR as a concise yet comprehensive benchmark for T2I safety alignment techniques for T2I models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional intrusion detection systems, which are static and slow in responding to modern dynamic, distributed, and multi-stage cyber threats.

Method: Utilizing Self-Adaptive Autonomic Computing Systems and an AI-driven MAPE-K loop for real-time decision-making, integrated with knowledge-driven architecture and contextual information.

Result: IRSDA was tested on a microservices application, demonstrating automation in intrusion containment, compliance enforcement, and providing traceable outputs for analysts.

Conclusion: IRSDA provides a modular, autonomous, and explainable framework for intrusion response with enhanced system-state awareness and operational control.

Abstract: Modern enterprise systems face escalating cyber threats that are increasingly dynamic, distributed, and multi-stage in nature. Traditional intrusion detection and response systems often rely on static rules and manual workflows, which limit their ability to respond with the speed and precision required in high-stakes environments. To address these challenges, we present the Intrusion Response System Digital Assistant (IRSDA), an agent-based framework designed to deliver autonomous and policy-compliant cyber defense. IRSDA combines Self-Adaptive Autonomic Computing Systems (SA-ACS) with the Knowledge guided Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute (MAPE-K) loop to support real-time, partition-aware decision-making across enterprise infrastructure.
  IRSDA incorporates a knowledge-driven architecture that integrates contextual information with AI-based reasoning to support system-guided intrusion response. The framework leverages retrieval mechanisms and structured representations to inform decision-making while maintaining alignment with operational policies. We assess the system using a representative real-world microservices application, demonstrating its ability to automate containment, enforce compliance, and provide traceable outputs for security analyst interpretation. This work outlines a modular and agent-driven approach to cyber defense that emphasizes explainability, system-state awareness, and operational control in intrusion response.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MalSynGen, a cGAN-based methodology to generate synthetic data for improving Android malware classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in Android malware detection due to the rising number of malware samples and attackers leveraging AI for evasion, coupled with the difficulty of obtaining high-quality real data.

Method: The authors use conditional GANs to generate synthetic tabular data that mimics the statistical characteristics of real-world malware datasets.

Result: Experiments show that MalSynGen improves classifier performance, is versatile across datasets, and is computationally efficient.

Conclusion: MalSynGen is a promising solution for tackling data scarcity and enhancing malware classifier robustness using synthetic data.

Abstract: The ever-increasing number of Android devices and the accelerated evolution of malware, reaching over 35 million samples by 2024, highlight the critical importance of effective detection methods. Attackers are now using Artificial Intelligence to create sophisticated malware variations that can easily evade traditional detection techniques. Although machine learning has shown promise in malware classification, its success relies heavily on the availability of up-to-date, high-quality datasets. The scarcity and high cost of obtaining and labeling real malware samples presents significant challenges in developing robust detection models. In this paper, we propose MalSynGen, a Malware Synthetic Data Generation methodology that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data. This data preserves the statistical properties of real-world data and improves the performance of Android malware classifiers. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using various datasets and metrics that assess the fidelity of the generated data, its utility in classification, and the computational efficiency of the process. Our experiments demonstrate that MalSynGen can generalize across different datasets, providing a viable solution to address the issues of obsolescence and low quality data in malware detection.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study compares LoRA fine-tuning to full fine-tuning of LLMs for malware classification transparency and explanations, finding LoRA offers competitive performance with increased efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in achieving trustworthy malware detection and transparent explanations using resource-efficient solutions.

Method: Comparison of five LoRA configurations against a fully fine-tuned LLM baseline using metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and semantic similarity.

Result: Full fine-tuning outperforms but mid-range LoRA models show competitive performance, reducing size by 81% and training time by over 80%.

Conclusion: LoRA is a practical alternative in resource-constrained environments, balancing explanation quality and resource efficiency while boosting system transparency and scalability.

Abstract: This study examines whether Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can approximate the performance of fully fine-tuned models in generating human-interpretable decisions and explanations for malware classification. Achieving trustworthy malware detection, particularly when LLMs are involved, remains a significant challenge. We developed an evaluation framework using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), and Semantic Similarity Metrics to benchmark explanation quality across five LoRA configurations and a fully fine-tuned baseline. Results indicate that full fine-tuning achieves the highest overall scores, with BLEU and ROUGE improvements of up to 10% over LoRA variants. However, mid-range LoRA models deliver competitive performance exceeding full fine-tuning on two metrics while reducing model size by approximately 81% and training time by over 80% on a LoRA model with 15.5% trainable parameters. These findings demonstrate that LoRA offers a practical balance of interpretability and resource efficiency, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments without sacrificing explanation quality. By providing feature-driven natural language explanations for malware classifications, this approach enhances transparency, analyst confidence, and operational scalability in malware detection systems.

TL;DR: Prompt Fencing introduces cryptographic authentication in LLM prompts for security, achieving zero successful attacks in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical security vulnerability of LLMs against prompt injection attacks, a major risk in production environments.

Method: Implemented cryptographically signed metadata to define security boundaries in prompts, with simulated fence awareness through prompt instructions.

Result: Complete prevention of injection attacks in experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% to 0% across 300 test cases with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Prompt Fencing is a platform-agnostic, effective security layer for LLMs, ready for incremental deployment and paving the way for native fence-aware models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, representing the most significant security threat in production deployments. We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples. Our approach is platform-agnostic and can be incrementally deployed as a security layer above existing LLM infrastructure, with the expectation that future models will be trained with native fence awareness for optimal security.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study explores the challenges of detecting behavioral backdoors across different large language models (LLMs) and presents a framework achieving better generalization across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI reliance on shared libraries and pre-trained components introduces supply chain vulnerabilities. Detecting backdoors in multi-LLM systems has serious implications for organizations using multiple AI systems.

Method: The study analyzed backdoor detection generalization across six LLMs via 1,198 execution traces and 36 experiments, focusing on behavioral differences and introducing model-aware detection using model identity.

Result: Single-model detectors had a dramatic drop in accuracy when applied across LLMs—from 92.7% to 49.2%. Using model-aware detection improved universal accuracy to 90.6%.

Conclusion: Cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection is achievable with model-aware methods. The study provides open datasets and frameworks, fostering reproducible research to advance multi-LLM security.

Abstract: As AI agents become integral to enterprise workflows, their reliance on shared tool libraries and pre-trained components creates significant supply chain vulnerabilities. While previous work has demonstrated behavioral backdoor detection within individual LLM architectures, the critical question of cross-LLM generalization remains unexplored, a gap with serious implications for organizations deploying multiple AI systems. We present the first systematic study of cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection, evaluating generalization across six production LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS 120B, and DeepSeek Chat V3.1). Through 1,198 execution traces and 36 cross-model experiments, we quantify a critical finding: single-model detectors achieve 92.7% accuracy within their training distribution but only 49.2% across different LLMs, a 43.4 percentage point generalization gap equivalent to random guessing. Our analysis reveals that this gap stems from model-specific behavioral signatures, particularly in temporal features (coefficient of variation > 0.8), while structural features remain stable across architectures. We show that model-aware detection incorporating model identity as an additional feature achieves 90.6% accuracy universally across all evaluated models. We release our multi-LLM trace dataset and detection framework to enable reproducible research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-knowledge framework enabling verification of deep learning inference without revealing model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to verify AI model inference without compromising the confidentiality of model parameters, considering their high training costs and intellectual property value.

Method: Development of a zero-knowledge framework using zkSNARKs (succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) to secure AI model inference verification, incorporating techniques like Fiat-Shamir heuristic and supporting a variety of neural network layers.

Result: The framework is practical and efficient, demonstrated by converting the DeepSeek model into ZK-DeepSeek and executing real-world AI verification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach establishes a feasible and secure method for verifying AI model performance without revealing internal parameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, have led to widespread adoption across various applications. Yet, a fundamental challenge persists: how can we verify the correctness of AI model inference when model owners cannot (or will not) reveal their parameters? These parameters represent enormous training costs and valuable intellectual property, making transparent verification difficult. In this paper, we introduce a zero-knowledge framework capable of verifying deep learning inference without exposing model internal parameters. Built on recursively composed zero-knowledge proofs and requiring no trusted setup, our framework supports both linear and nonlinear neural network layers, including matrix multiplication, normalization, softmax, and SiLU. Leveraging the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, we obtain a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) with constant-size proofs. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we translate the DeepSeek model into a fully SNARK-verifiable version named ZK-DeepSeek and show experimentally that our framework delivers both efficiency and flexibility in real-world AI verification workloads.

*Friederike Groschupp,Daniele Lain,Aritra Dhar,Lara Magdalena Lazier,Srdjan Čapkun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for dynamic and context-aware access control decisions, achieving significant accuracy in aligning with user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users face cognitive overload in making access control decisions due to system complexity, leading to suboptimal security choices.

Method: Conducted a user study with 307 privacy statements and 14,682 user decisions, comparing them with general and personalized LLM decisions, collecting feedback on 1,446 LLM decisions.

Result: LLMs achieved up to 86% accuracy in reflecting users' majority decisions, but noted trade-offs with personalization affecting adherence to security practices.

Conclusion: Implementing LLM-based access control systems requires careful balancing of personalization, security best practices, and system utility.

Abstract: Precise access control decisions are crucial to the security of both traditional applications and emerging agent-based systems. Typically, these decisions are made by users during app installation or at runtime. Due to the increasing complexity and automation of systems, making these access control decisions can add a significant cognitive load on users, often overloading them and leading to suboptimal or even arbitrary access control decisions. To address this problem, we propose to leverage the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to make dynamic, context-aware decisions aligned with the user's security preferences. For this purpose, we conducted a user study, which resulted in a dataset of 307 natural-language privacy statements and 14,682 access control decisions made by users. We then compare these decisions against those made by two versions of LLMs: a general and a personalized one, for which we also gathered user feedback on 1,446 of its decisions.
  Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users. Our study also reveals a crucial trade-off in personalizing such a system: while providing user-specific privacy preferences to the LLM generally improves agreement with individual user decisions, adhering to those preferences can also violate some security best practices. Based on our findings, we discuss design and risk considerations for implementing a practical natural-language-based access control system that balances personalization, security, and utility.

*Chi Liu,Tianqing Zhu,Wanlei Zhou,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the frequency bias in deep neural network (DNN) forgery detectors as a root cause for problems in generalizability and robustness. It proposes a two-step frequency alignment method to enhance reliability and explores both attack and defense applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-powered deep image forgery, especially through GANs, poses security challenges. There is a gap in understanding the root causes behind generalization and robustness issues faced by forgery detectors and how a universal method could improve both forensic and anti-forensic contexts.

Method: The paper analyzes the frequency bias in DNN forgery detectors. It introduces a two-step frequency alignment method to address frequency discrepancies between real and fake images. This approach is implemented for both attack and defense applications.

Result: The study demonstrates the method’s effectiveness across experimental settings, involving 12 detectors, 8 forgery models, and 5 metrics.

Conclusion: Frequency bias contributes to generalizability and robustness issues in forgery detection. The frequency alignment method improves reliability both as an attack mechanism and as a defense strategy for detectors.

Abstract: As deep image forgery powered by AI generative models, such as GANs, continues to challenge today's digital world, detecting AI-generated forgeries has become a vital security topic. Generalizability and robustness are two critical concerns of a forgery detector, determining its reliability when facing unknown GANs and noisy samples in an open world. Although many studies focus on improving these two properties, the root causes of these problems have not been fully explored, and it is unclear if there is a connection between them. Moreover, despite recent achievements in addressing these issues from image forensic or anti-forensic aspects, a universal method that can contribute to both sides simultaneously remains practically significant yet unavailable. In this paper, we provide a fundamental explanation of these problems from a frequency perspective. Our analysis reveals that the frequency bias of a DNN forgery detector is a possible cause of generalization and robustness issues. Based on this finding, we propose a two-step frequency alignment method to remove the frequency discrepancy between real and fake images, offering double-sided benefits: it can serve as a strong black-box attack against forgery detectors in the anti-forensic context or, conversely, as a universal defense to improve detector reliability in the forensic context. We also develop corresponding attack and defense implementations and demonstrate their effectiveness, as well as the effect of the frequency alignment method, in various experimental settings involving twelve detectors, eight forgery models, and five metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in existing APC systems that either lack practicality by using reference pitches or fail to preserve natural expressiveness due to simplistic pitch estimation algorithms.

Method: BERT-APC employs a stationary pitch predictor for perceiving pitches, a context-aware pitch predictor using a music language model to derive intended pitches, and a note-level correction algorithm to maintain expressiveness. It also integrates a learnable data augmentation strategy for robust performance.

Result: BERT-APC outperforms both research and commercial APC models, such as ROSVOT and AutoTune, achieving higher raw pitch accuracy and superior MOS test scores.

Conclusion: By leveraging a music language model, BERT-APC sets a new benchmark for APC, offering effective, reference-free pitch correction with preserved emotional and expressive nuances in vocal performances.

Abstract: Automatic Pitch Correction (APC) enhances vocal recordings by aligning pitch deviations with the intended musical notes. However, existing APC systems either rely on reference pitches, which limits their practical applicability, or employ simple pitch estimation algorithms that often fail to preserve expressiveness and naturalness. We propose BERT-APC, a novel reference-free APC framework that corrects pitch errors while maintaining the natural expressiveness of vocal performances. In BERT-APC, a novel stationary pitch predictor first estimates the perceived pitch of each note from the detuned singing voice. A context-aware note pitch predictor estimates the intended pitch sequence by leveraging a music language model repurposed to incorporate musical context. Finally, a note-level correction algorithm fixes pitch errors while preserving intentional pitch deviations for emotional expression. In addition, we introduce a learnable data augmentation strategy that improves the robustness of the music language model by simulating realistic detuning patterns. Compared to two recent singing voice transcription models, BERT-APC demonstrated superior performance in note pitch prediction, outperforming the second-best model, ROSVOT, by 10.49%p on highly detuned samples in terms of the raw pitch accuracy. In the MOS test, BERT-APC achieved the highest score of $4.32 \pm 0.15$, which is significantly higher than those of the widely-used commercial APC tools, AutoTune ($3.22 \pm 0.18$) and Melodyne ($3.08 \pm 0.18$), while maintaining a comparable ability to preserve expressive nuances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first APC model that leverages a music language model to achieve reference-free pitch correction with symbolic musical context. The corrected audio samples of BERT-APC are available online.

*Wendy Wong,Yuchao Jiang,Yuekang Li*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper highlights the ineffectiveness of one-size-fits-all teaching in CS1 courses and introduces DiverseClaire—a pilot study utilizing LLMs and neurodiverse personas to promote UDL-aligned learning materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by neurodiverse learners in CS1 courses caused by inaccessible teaching formats.

Method: The study used Bloom's Taxonomy and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to create and analyze lecture slides, simulating neurodiverse student profiles via LLMs within controlled experiments.

Result: Neurodiverse students struggled with learning using inaccessible lecture slide formats, with measurable disparities in performance.

Conclusion: Providing course materials in multiple formats can accommodate diverse learner preferences, and the pilot study data can guide future CS1 instructors toward more inclusive teaching methods.

Abstract: Although CS programs are booming, introductory courses like CS1 still adopt a one-size-fits-all formats that can exacerbate cognitive load and discourage learners with autism, ADHD, dyslexia and other neurological conditions. These call for compassionate pedagogies and Universal Design For Learning (UDL) to create learning environments and materials where cognitive diversity is welcomed. To address this, we introduce DiverseClaire a pilot study, which simulates students including neurodiverse profiles using LLMs and diverse personas. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy and UDL, DiverseClaire compared UDL-transformed lecture slides with traditional formats. To evaluate DiverseClaire controlled experiments, we used the evaluation metric the average score. The findings revealed that the simulated neurodiverse students struggled with learning due to lecture slides that were in inaccessible formats. These results highlight the need to provide course materials in multiple formats for diverse learner preferences. Data from our pilot study will be made available to assist future CS1 instructors.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of Generative AI to contextualize STEAM education in Ghana by using culturally responsive methods and highlights its strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if Generative AI can effectively adapt STEAM education to better reflect cultural and community contexts in the Global South, particularly in Ghana.

Method: A mixed-methods approach was used, involving four STEAM experts who evaluated AI-generated culturally responsive lesson plans using a rubric and qualitative reflections.

Result: Generative AI with a specially designed tool provided culturally grounded and pedagogically responsive lesson plans that incorporated Indigenous knowledge and local practices but had limitations in representing the cultural diversity in Mathematics and Computing.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows potential as a tool for culturally responsive education, but requires further iteration, teacher collaboration, and inclusion of Indigenous language data to address its shortcomings.

Abstract: This study investigates how human experts evaluate the capacity of Generative AI (GenAI) to contextualize STEAM education in the Global South, with a focus on Ghana. Using a convergent mixed-methods design, four STEAM specialists assessed GenAI-generated lesson plans created with a customized Culturally Responsive Lesson Planner (CRLP) and compared them to standardized lesson plans from the Ghana National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA). Quantitative ratings were based on a validated 25-item Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Rubric measuring bias awareness, cultural representation, contextual relevance, linguistic responsiveness, and teacher agency. Qualitative reflections provided additional insight into how GenAI handles cultural and pedagogical appropriateness.
  Findings show that GenAI, when paired with the CRLP tool, can support contextualized STEAM instruction by linking abstract curriculum standards to learners' cultural knowledge, community practices, and everyday experiences. Experts rated GenAI-assisted lessons as more culturally grounded and pedagogically responsive than NaCCA plans, integrating Indigenous knowledge, bilingual elements, and locally relevant examples. However, GenAI struggled to represent Ghana's cultural pluralism, often offering surface-level references to language, history, and identity. These weaknesses were most evident in Mathematics and Computing, where cultural nuance was limited. The results highlight the need for continued teacher mediation, community involvement, and culturally attuned refinement of AI outputs. Future work should include classroom trials, expanded expert participation, and model fine-tuning using Indigenous language corpora to strengthen cultural fidelity in Global South contexts.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper focuses on how generative AI creates persuasive attacks that challenge organizational communication. It introduces a dataset for analyzing these AI-generated narratives to help improve defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI models can create persuasive narratives rapidly, potentially undermining trust in official communications from government and commercial agencies.

Method: Researchers developed a dataset comprising 134,136 persuasive attacks generated by GPT-4, Gemma 2, and Llama 3.1 against 972 press releases. These attacks span 23 persuasive techniques and include both press release statements and social media posts.

Result: The study found variations in moral resonance across AI models: GPT-4 focused primarily on Care, Gemma 2 emphasized Care and Authority, while Llama 3.1 centered on Loyalty and Care.

Conclusion: Analyzing LLM-generated persuasive attacks will enhance organizational defenses and resilience, fostering sustainable communication strategies in response to the growing influence of AI.

Abstract: Organization's communication is essential for public trust, but the rise of generative AI models has introduced significant challenges by generating persuasive content that can form competing narratives with official messages from government and commercial organizations at speed and scale. This has left agencies in a reactive position, often unaware of how these models construct their persuasive strategies, making it more difficult to sustain communication effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce a large LLM-generated persuasion attack dataset, which includes 134,136 attacks generated by GPT-4, Gemma 2, and Llama 3.1 on agency news. These attacks span 23 persuasive techniques from SemEval 2023 Task 3, directed toward 972 press releases from ten agencies. The generated attacks come in two mediums, press release statements and social media posts, covering both long-form and short-form communication strategies. We analyzed the moral resonance of these persuasion attacks to understand their attack vectors. GPT-4's attacks mainly focus on Care, with Authority and Loyalty also playing a role. Gemma 2 emphasizes Care and Authority, while Llama 3.1 centers on Loyalty and Care. Analyzing LLM-generated persuasive attacks across models will enable proactive defense, allow to create the reputation armor for organizations, and propel the development of both effective and resilient communications in the information ecosystem.

*Parker Whitfill,Ben Snodin,Joel Becker*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper investigates the future impact of potential compute slowdowns on AI agent capabilities, focusing on the relationship between training compute and time horizon growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the implications of potential compute growth slowdowns on the scalability of AI capabilities and time horizon metrics, given current scaling trends may not persist.

Method: They develop a model linking time horizon growth to training compute and algorithmic progress, supported by empirical evidence and projections on compute investments.

Result: The analysis suggests time horizon growth depends on compute, with potential slowdowns causing delays. For instance, achieving 1-month time horizons at high reliability might take seven additional years under slower compute growth projections.

Conclusion: Compute scaling plays a crucial role in the progress of AI capabilities, and potential slowdowns necessitate recalibrated projections of future AI developments.

Abstract: METR's time horizon metric has grown exponentially since 2019, along with compute. However, it is unclear whether compute scaling will persist at current rates through 2030, raising the question of how possible compute slowdowns might impact AI agent capability forecasts. Given a model of time horizon as a function of training compute and algorithms, along with a model of how compute investment spills into algorithmic progress (which, notably, precludes the possibility of a software-only singularity), and the empirical fact that both time horizon and compute have grown at constant rates over 2019--2025, we derive that time horizon growth must be proportional to compute growth. We provide additional, albeit limited, experimental evidence consistent with this theory. We use our model to project time horizon growth under OpenAI's compute projection, finding substantial projected delays in some cases. For example, 1-month time horizons at $80\%$ reliability occur $7$ years later than simple trend extrapolation suggests.

*Mutlu Cukurova,Wannapon Suraworachet,Qi Zhou,Sahan Bulathwela*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper addresses the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education, discussing its benefits and challenges for teachers, and proposes a framework for teacher-AI collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the increasing adoption of GenAI in education, which offers efficiency but poses challenges like reduced teacher agency and deprofessionalization.

Method: A conceptual framework of five levels of teacher-AI teaming is developed, based on prior literature and a systematic review, to understand teacher-AI interactions.

Result: The framework identifies five levels of teacher-AI teaming and emphasizes collaborative decision-making and co-reasoning between teachers and AI.

Conclusion: A vision for an ethical and practical synergy of teachers and AI is proposed, aiming to enhance cooperative capabilities toward outcomes neither can achieve independently.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly used in education, posing significant challenges for teachers adapting to these changes. GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for accessibility, scalability and productivity in educational tasks. However, the automation of teaching tasks through GenAI raises concerns about reduced teacher agency, potential cognitive atrophy, and the broader deprofessionalisation of teaching. Drawing findings from prior literature on AI in Education, and refining through a recent systematic literature review, this chapter presents a conceptualisation of five levels of teacher-AI teaming: transactional, situational, operational, praxical and synergistic teaming. The framework aims to capture the nuanced dynamics of teacher-AI interactions, particularly with GenAI, that may lead to the replacement, complementarity, or augmentation of teachers' competences and professional practice. GenAI technological affordances required in supporting teaming, along with empirical studies, are discussed. Drawing on empirical observations, we outline a future vision that moves beyond individual teacher agency toward collaborative decision-making between teachers and AI, in which both agents engage in negotiation, constructive challenge, and co-reasoning that enhance each other's capabilities and enable outcomes neither could realise independently. Further discussion of socio-technical factors beyond teacher-AI teaming is also included to streamline the synergy of teachers and AI in education ethically and practically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the conceptual, societal, and ethical implications of AI technologies that simulate deceased individuals, addressing their impact on mourning and remembrance.

Method: The paper incorporates ethical analysis, a nine-dimensional taxonomy of digital afterlife technologies, and suggested guidelines for ethically managing digital ghosts.

Result: It identifies ethical tensions such as grief, deception, privacy, and misrepresentation while offering regulatory and professional measures.

Conclusion: The study argues for ethical management, professional guidelines, and regulation to ensure respectful and truthful implementation of digital ghosts for remembrance purposes.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence now make it possible to simulate the dead through chatbots, voice clones, and video avatars trained on a person's digital traces. These "digital ghosts" are moving from fiction to commercial reality, reshaping how people mourn and remember. This paper offers a conceptual and ethical analysis of AI-mediated digital afterlives. We define what counts as a digital ghost, trace their rise across personal, commercial, and institutional contexts, and identify core ethical tensions around grief and well-being, truthfulness and deception, consent and posthumous privacy, dignity and misrepresentation, and the commercialization of mourning. To analyze these challenges, we propose a nine-dimensional taxonomy of digital afterlife technologies and, building on it, outline the features of an ethically acceptable digital ghost: premortem intent, mutual consent, transparent and limited data use, clear disclosure, restricted purposes and access, family or estate stewardship, and minimal behavioral agency. We argue for targeted regulation and professional guidelines to ensure that digital ghosts can aid remembrance without slipping into forms of deception.

*Hongjian Jiang,Michael Hahn,Georg Zetzsche,Anthony Widjaja Lin*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: The paper proves that length-generalizable softmax Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are Turing-complete, with theoretical and empirical backing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the open problem of whether softmax attention CoT transformers achieve Turing-completeness and to understand their computational capabilities when combined with length generalization.

Method: Theoretical proof is provided using the CoT extension of Counting RASP (C-RASP) and causal masking over a unary alphabet, along with extensions incorporating relative positional encoding. Empirical validations are made with transformer training on complex arithmetic reasoning tasks.

Result: The paper establishes that CoT C-RASP transformers are Turing-complete for letter-bounded languages, and, with positional encoding, for arbitrary languages. Empirical experiments validate these claims.

Conclusion: Length-generalizable softmax CoT transformers have Turing-complete computational power, with potential for handling complex reasoning tasks under specific configurations and extensions.

Abstract: Hard attention Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are known to be Turing-complete. However, it is an open problem whether softmax attention Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are Turing-complete. In this paper, we prove a stronger result that length-generalizable softmax CoT transformers are Turing-complete. More precisely, our Turing-completeness proof goes via the CoT extension of the Counting RASP (C-RASP), which correspond to softmax CoT transformers that admit length generalization. We prove Turing-completeness for CoT C-RASP with causal masking over a unary alphabet (more generally, for letter-bounded languages). While we show this is not Turing-complete for arbitrary languages, we prove that its extension with relative positional encoding is Turing-complete for arbitrary languages. We empirically validate our theory by training transformers for languages requiring complex (non-linear) arithmetic reasoning.

*Wiktoria Agata Pawlak*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational framework to simulate how glioblastoma (GBM) emerges, focusing on mitochondrial function, bioelectrical signaling, and related dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the tumorigenic transitions of glioblastoma and the role bioelectric signaling plays in the emergence of malignancies.

Method: An agent-based simulation framework is developed, incorporating factors like mitochondrial efficiency, ion-channel dynamics, and ROS in a multicellular grid, coupled with evolutionary optimization techniques.

Result: Simulations revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction alone leads to depolarization, ATP collapse, and ROS elevation, simulating characteristics of GBM. Evolutionary runs also exposed resilience and the parameter sensitivity driving tumor-like behavior.

Conclusion: Mitochondrial energy inefficiency and bioelectric lapses can act as sufficient triggers for malignant-like states, suggesting key oncogenic origins and guiding future bioelectrical research.

Abstract: Understanding how glioblastoma (GBM) emerges from initially healthy glial tissue requires models that integrate bioelectrical, metabolic, and multicellular dynamics. This work introduces an ASAL-inspired agent-based framework that simulates bioelectric state transitions in glial cells as a function of mitochondrial efficiency (Meff), ion-channel conductances, gap-junction coupling, and ROS dynamics. Using a 64x64 multicellular grid over 60,000 simulation steps, we show that reducing Meff below a critical threshold (~0.6) drives sustained depolarization, ATP collapse, and elevated ROS, reproducing key electrophysiological signatures associated with GBM. We further apply evolutionary optimization (genetic algorithms and MAP-Elites) to explore resilience, parameter sensitivity, and the emergence of tumor-like attractors. Early evolutionary runs converge toward depolarized, ROS-dominated regimes characterized by weakened electrical coupling and altered ionic transport. These results highlight mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted bioelectric signaling as sufficient drivers of malignant-like transitions and provide a computational basis for probing the bioelectrical origins of oncogenesis.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) in modeling complex spin configurations in frustrated magnets, validating the approach through benchmarks on specific examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) as generative models for highly correlated and constrained magnetic states in frustrated magnets, which are challenging to model.

Method: The authors employed RBMs to model spin configurations in various magnetic systems, including the ANNNI model and kagome spin ice. They compared RBM-generated output to Monte Carlo simulations and incorporated symmetry considerations for specific phases.

Result: RBMs effectively learned spin correlations, matched ground-state properties in the ANNNI model, modeled local ice rules and correlations in kagome spin ice, and captured the symmetry-broken features of the ice-II phase using bias fields.

Conclusion: RBMs are shown to be strong generative tools for understanding and reproducing complex magnetic states, providing flexibility in tackling geometric frustration and correlation constraints in physics.

Abstract: We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.

TL;DR: Duo-Tok is a music tokenizer that balances quality and learnability in lyrics-to-song systems by leveraging a source-aware dual-codebook approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing high-quality music reconstruction with LM-friendly tokenization for lyrics-to-song systems, which existing methods fail to achieve effectively.

Method: The authors propose a four-stage pipeline: pretraining a BEST-RQ-style encoder, stabilizing representations with noise and multi-task supervision, developing dual codebooks for vocals and accompaniment via SimVQ, and training latent diffusion decoders.

Result: The method outperforms existing codecs by achieving a better balance on the reconstruction-generation trade-off, with superior tagging accuracy and lower language model perplexity.

Conclusion: Duo-Tok effectively shifts the Pareto frontier, offering a novel solution for music tokenization that improves both reconstruction fidelity and LM applicability without compromising quality.

Abstract: Duo-Tok is a source-aware dual-codebook tokenizer for vocal-accompaniment music that targets the growing tension between reconstruction quality and language-model (LM) learnability in modern lyrics-to-song systems. Existing codecs either prioritize high-fidelity reconstruction with difficult-to-model acoustic tokens or compress aggressively into semantic tokens that are LM-friendly but lossy, and they rarely make the tokenizer itself aware of dual-track structure. Duo-Tok follows a four-stage, SSL-centered pipeline: we first pretrain a BEST-RQ-style encoder on large-scale audio, then stabilize and factorize the representation with Gaussian replacement noise and multi-task supervision, before freezing the encoder to learn SimVQ-based dual codebooks with hard routing for vocals and accompaniment, and finally training latent diffusion decoders on top of the discrete tokens. Duo-Tok at 0.75 kbps shifts the empirical reconstruction-generation Pareto frontier, achieving the best music-tagging AP and the lowest vocabulary-normalized LM perplexity among compared codecs while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to state-of-the-art music tokenizers.

TL;DR: The paper explores diffusion models for singing voice separation, optimizing inference and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in music source separation, particularly overlapping sources and the need for generative approaches over traditional transformation techniques.

Method: Implemented latent diffusion models, training solely on pairs of isolated vocals and mixtures, decoding from a compact latent space for optimized performance.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing generative systems and matched performance with non-generative systems in signal quality and interference reduction. Noise robustness of the latent encoder was also evaluated.

Conclusion: Latent diffusion models show promise in efficient creative workflows for generative music separation. The authors release a toolkit for further exploration of this topic.

Abstract: Extracting individual elements from music mixtures is a valuable tool for music production and practice. While neural networks optimized to mask or transform mixture spectrograms into the individual source(s) have been the leading approach, the source overlap and correlation in music signals poses an inherent challenge. Also, accessing all sources in the mixture is crucial to train these systems, while complicated. Attempts to address these challenges in a generative fashion exist, however, the separation performance and inference efficiency remain limited. In this work, we study the potential of diffusion models to advance toward bridging this gap, focusing on generative singing voice separation relying only on corresponding pairs of isolated vocals and mixtures for training. To align with creative workflows, we leverage latent diffusion: the system generates samples encoded in a compact latent space, and subsequently decodes these into audio. This enables efficient optimization and faster inference. Our system is trained using only open data. We outperform existing generative separation systems, and level the compared non-generative systems on a list of signal quality measures and on interference removal. We provide a noise robustness study on the latent encoder, providing insights on its potential for the task. We release a modular toolkit for further research on the topic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional graphic equalizer designs used in reverberation systems, which require numerous filters per delay line and are computationally expensive.

Method: The approach employs Second Order Sections (SOS) of IIR filters as parametric equalizers with shared parameters across delay lines, while adjusting gains based on delay length. It is fully differentiable and optimized using supervised learning in gradient-based frameworks.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in filter fitting and frequency-dependent reverberation decay control, with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: The method provides a flexible, scalable, and efficient solution for attenuation filter design in reverberation systems, compatible with modern learning frameworks and yielding significant improvements in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for designing attenuation filters in digital audio reverberation systems based on Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs). Our approach uses Second Order Sections (SOS) of Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters arranged as parametric equalizers (PEQ), enabling fine control over frequency-dependent reverberation decay. Unlike traditional graphic equalizer designs, which require numerous filters per delay line, we propose a scalable solution where the number of filters can be adjusted. The frequency, gain, and quality factor (Q) parameters are shared parameters across delay lines and only the gain is adjusted based on delay length. This design not only reduces the number of optimization parameters, but also remains fully differentiable and compatible with gradient-based learning frameworks. Leveraging principles of analog filter design, our method allows for efficient and accurate filter fitting using supervised learning. Our method delivers a flexible and differentiable design, achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new layers to the network architecture, L8 for communication structure and L9 for semantic negotiation, enabling scalable multi-agent collaboration by addressing limitations in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current network architectures are ill-suited for agent collaboration with semantic understanding, and LLMs face memory and computational limitations that require distributed, scalable solutions.

Method: Proposing and designing two new layers: Agent Communication Layer (L8) for standardizing structure in agent communication, and Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9) to formalize meaning and shared context among agents.

Result: These new layers enable scalable communication and semantic collaboration among agents, laying the groundwork for distributed, multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture advances scalable multi-agent collaboration by overcoming LLM limitations, facilitating the Internet of Agents through a formal communication and semantic framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements and the ability to learn domain-specific languages (DSLs), including APIs and tool interfaces. This capability has enabled the creation of AI agents that can perform preliminary computations and act through tool calling, now being standardized via protocols like MCP. However, LLMs face fundamental limitations: their context windows cannot grow indefinitely, constraining their memory and computational capacity. Agent collaboration emerges as essential for solving increasingly complex problems, mirroring how computational systems rely on different types of memory to scale. The "Internet of Agents" (IoA) represents the communication stack that enables agents to scale by distributing computation across collaborating entities.
  Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}. L8 formalizes the \textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the \textit{meaning} of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a "Shared Context" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction. Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unclear influence of merging PASS and RIS in wireless communication motivated exploration for improving performance metrics like sum rate and energy efficiency.

Method: The method involves modeling optimization problems for sum rate and energy efficiency, and designing a novel three-stage GNN to optimize antenna positions, RIS phase shifts, and beamforming vectors, with unsupervised training and implementation strategies.

Result: The proposed GNN is effective, providing generalization, reliability, and real-time application capabilities, validated through numerical results.

Conclusion: The integration of PASS with RIS, optimized using the GNN, demonstrates promising improvements in wireless communication performance, with insights into key parameter impacts.

Abstract: This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-waveguide pinching-antenna (PA) system (PASS) for multi-user downlink information transmission, motivated by the unknown impact of the integration of emerging PASS and RIS on wireless communications. First, we formulate sum rate (SR) and energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems in a unified framework, subject to constraints on the movable region of PAs, total power budget, and tunable phase of RIS elements. Then, by leveraging a graph-structured topology of the RIS-assisted PASS, a novel three-stage graph neural network (GNN) is proposed, which learns PA positions based on user locations, and RIS phase shifts according to composite channel conditions at the first two stages, respectively, and finally determines beamforming vectors. Specifically, the proposed GNN is achieved through unsupervised training, together with three implementation strategies for its integration with convex optimization, thus offering trade-offs between inference time and solution optimality. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN, and to support its unique attributes of viable generalization capability, good performance reliability, and real-time applicability. Moreover, the impact of key parameters on RIS-assisted PASS is illustrated and analyzed.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces EnergyTwin, a simulation platform for microgrid management, combining physical models and agent-based planning to enhance efficiency and resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of coordinating distributed energy resources in microgrids to reduce grid reliance, manage tariffs, and ensure service continuity.

Method: The EnergyTwin platform integrates physically grounded models with rolling-horizon planning and agent-based negotiations in a microgrid setting.

Result: Tests on a university campus microgrid show that the EnergyTwin platform enhances energy self-sufficiency, improves battery reserves, and minimizes operational risks.

Conclusion: EnergyTwin offers a promising tool for resilient and negotiation-driven microgrid research and decision-making, highlighting its potential extensibility for digital-twin applications.

Abstract: Microgrids are deployed to reduce purchased grid energy, limit exposure to volatile tariffs, and ensure service continuity during disturbances. This requires coordinating heterogeneous distributed energy resources across multiple time scales and under variable conditions. Among existing tools, typically, power-system simulators capture physical behaviour but assume centralized control, while multi-agent frameworks model decentralized decision-making but represent energy with no physical grounding. In this context, the EnergyTwin is introduced, an agent-based microgrid simulation environment that couples physically grounded models with forecast-informed, rolling-horizon planning, and negotiations. Each asset is modeled as an agent, interacting with a central agent that obtains forecasts, formulates predictions, and allocates energy through contract-based interactions. EnergyTwin targets tertiary-layer decision making and is extensible for digital-twin use. Its feasibility was evaluated in a university campus microgrid scenario where multiple planning strategies were compared. Achieved results show that forecast-driven rolling-horizon planning increases local energy self-sufficiency, maintains higher battery reserves, and reduces exposure to low-resilience operating states. They demonstrate also potential of EnergyTwin as platform supporting research on resilient, negotiation-driven microgrids.

### [493] [Trust-Based Social Learning for Communication (TSLEC) Protocol Evolution in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19562)
*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces TSLEC, a framework that uses trust-based social learning to accelerate emergent communication in multi-agent systems, and shows it improves efficiency and protocol robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-agent systems, traditional independent learning approaches to emergent communication often converge slowly and result in suboptimal outcomes. This paper seeks to address these limitations by enhancing learning efficiency and protocol robustness.

Method: The authors propose TSLEC, a framework where agents utilize explicit teaching combined with learned trust relationships to guide knowledge transfer. Social learning is implemented and tested experimentally over 100 episodes with 30 random seeds to evaluate its effects.

Result: Trust-based social learning through TSLEC reduces episodes-to-convergence by 23.9% compared to independent methods. It also produces compositional and robust communication protocols, with strong correlation between trust scores and teaching quality.

Conclusion: The implementation of trust-based social learning significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of emergent communication in multi-agent systems, paving the way for faster convergence and more resilient communication strategies.

Abstract: Emergent communication in multi-agent systems typically occurs through independent learning, resulting in slow convergence and potentially suboptimal protocols. We introduce TSLEC (Trust-Based Social Learning with Emergent Communication), a framework where agents explicitly teach successful strategies to peers, with knowledge transfer modulated by learned trust relationships. Through experiments with 100 episodes across 30 random seeds, we demonstrate that trust-based social learning reduces episodes-to-convergence by 23.9% (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.98) compared to independent emergence, while producing compositional protocols (C = 0.38) that remain robust under dynamic objectives (Phi > 0.867 decoding accuracy). Trust scores strongly correlate with teaching quality (r = 0.743, p < 0.001), enabling effective knowledge filtering. Our results establish that explicit social learning fundamentally accelerates emergent communication in multi-agent coordination.

### [494] [An Adaptive, Data-Integrated Agent-Based Modeling Framework for Explainable and Contestable Policy Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19726)
*Roberto Garrone*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for adaptive multi-agent systems using dynamic regimes, information-theoretic tools, causal models, agent-level priors, and unsupervised methods, along with a methodology for analyzing system behaviors and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations in multi-agent system studies, which often rely on static decision rules and fixed parameters, by proposing a framework to adapt to feedback, adaptation, and non-stationarity.

Method: The framework integrates dynamic agent and parameter regimes, information-theoretic diagnostics, structural causal models, methods for generating agent priors, and unsupervised techniques for identifying behavioral regimes.

Result: The framework provides a domain-neutral architecture for analyzing adaptive systems and systematically comparing their stability, performance, and interpretability across a range of dynamics.

Conclusion: This structured methodology enhances the development of explainable and contestable decision processes in multi-agent systems, enabling better understanding and intervention in adaptive environments.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems often operate under feedback, adaptation, and non-stationarity, yet many simulation studies retain static decision rules and fixed control parameters. This paper introduces a general adaptive multi-agent learning framework that integrates: (i) four dynamic regimes distinguishing static versus adaptive agents and fixed versus adaptive system parameters; (ii) information-theoretic diagnostics (entropy rate, statistical complexity, and predictive information) to assess predictability and structure; (iii) structural causal models for explicit intervention semantics; (iv) procedures for generating agent-level priors from aggregate or sample data; and (v) unsupervised methods for identifying emergent behavioral regimes. The framework offers a domain-neutral architecture for analyzing how learning agents and adaptive controls jointly shape system trajectories, enabling systematic comparison of stability, performance, and interpretability across non-equilibrium, oscillatory, or drifting dynamics. Mathematical definitions, computational operators, and an experimental design template are provided, yielding a structured methodology for developing explainable and contestable multi-agent decision processes.

*Chenglu Sun,Shuo Shen,Haonan Hu,Wei Zhou,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces LCDSP, a novel language-controlled reinforcement learning framework, focusing on understanding and executing high-level instructions in complex environments like football games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in LC-RL, there is a challenge in extending its capabilities to handle high-level, abstract instructions in complex, multi-agent settings.

Method: The authors propose LCDSP, which integrates Diverse Style Training (DST) for diverse behavior learning and a Style Interpreter (SI) to convert language instructions into style parameters.

Result: In 5v5 football experiments, LCDSP demonstrates the ability to grasp abstract tactical commands and execute diverse behaviors accurately.

Conclusion: LCDSP shows great promise for handling high-level language-controlled tasks in intricate, real-world multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Despite advancements in language-controlled reinforcement learning (LC-RL) for basic domains and straightforward commands (e.g., object manipulation and navigation), effectively extending LC-RL to comprehend and execute high-level or abstract instructions in complex, multi-agent environments, such as football games, remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we introduce Language-Controlled Diverse Style Policies (LCDSP), a novel LC-RL paradigm specifically designed for complex scenarios. LCDSP comprises two key components: a Diverse Style Training (DST) method and a Style Interpreter (SI). The DST method efficiently trains a single policy capable of exhibiting a wide range of diverse behaviors by modulating agent actions through style parameters (SP). The SI is designed to accurately and rapidly translate high-level language instructions into these corresponding SP. Through extensive experiments in a complex 5v5 football environment, we demonstrate that LCDSP effectively comprehends abstract tactical instructions and accurately executes the desired diverse behavioral styles, showcasing its potential for complex, real-world applications.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper extends the convergence analysis of two optimization methods, AdaSLS and AdaSPS, to nonconvex settings, providing unified analysis and convergence rates under different conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve understanding of adaptive optimization methods, specifically AdaSLS and AdaSPS, by examining their performance in nonconvex scenarios.

Method: The authors provide a unified theoretical convergence analysis for AdaSLS and AdaSPS in nonconvex optimization settings, evaluating their convergence rates under smooth functions, quasar-convexity, interpolation, and strong growth conditions.

Result: The paper establishes $(1/{\sqrt{T}})$ convergence rate for general nonconvex smooth functions, $(1/{T})$ rate under quasar-convexity/interpolation, and $(1/{T})$ rate under strong growth conditions for nonconvex functions.

Conclusion: AdaSLS and AdaSPS demonstrate effective convergence rates in nonconvex optimization setups, capable of handling diverse conditions such as smoothness, quasar-convexity, and strong growth conditions.

### [497] [PAC-Bayes Meets Online Contextual Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20413)
*Zhuojun Xie,Adam Abdin,Yiping Fang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian online contextual optimization framework, departing from traditional frequentist and gradient-based methods, achieving improved theoretical and practical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improving online learning in dynamic environments, where existing methods suffer from high variance, reliance on gradients, and deterministic predictors despite their theoretical guarantees.

Method: The authors propose a Bayesian framework grounded in PAC-Bayes theory, using Gibbs posterior and sequential Monte Carlo samplers to facilitate nondifferentiable and mixable loss problems.

Result: The framework achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for bounded and mixable losses, eliminates dependence on gradient-based methods, and proves its effectiveness through theoretical and numerical analyses.

Conclusion: This novel Bayesian approach enhances online contextual optimization, offering a robust alternative to existing frequentist and gradient-reliant methods, with lower variance and broader applicability.

Abstract: The predict-then-optimize paradigm bridges online learning and contextual optimization in dynamic environments. Previous works have investigated the sequential updating of predictors using feedback from downstream decisions to minimize regret in the full-information settings. However, existing approaches are predominantly frequentist, rely heavily on gradient-based strategies, and employ deterministic predictors that could yield high variance in practice despite their asymptotic guarantees. This work introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the first Bayesian online contextual optimization framework. Grounded in PAC-Bayes theory and general Bayesian updating principles, our framework achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for bounded and mixable losses via a Gibbs posterior, eliminates the dependence on gradients through sequential Monte Carlo samplers, and thereby accommodates nondifferentiable problems. Theoretical developments and numerical experiments substantiate our claims.

### [498] [Optimization of Sums of Bivariate Functions: An Introduction to Relaxation-Based Methods for the Case of Finite Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20607)
*Nils Müller*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the optimization of functions represented as sums of bivariate functions over finite domains, exploring their computational complexity, tractable formulations, and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to optimize complex functions that can be decomposed into simpler bivariate components, particularly in computationally challenging scenarios.

Method: The paper uses measure-valued relaxations, $  ^2$-approximation, entropy regularization, linear programming, coordinate ascent, and closed-form solutions to tackle optimization problems of sums of bivariates.

Result: It demonstrates the computational complexity as NP-equivalent, identifies potential optimizations (free lunch), introduces tractable variants, and provides experimental results in random functions, vertex coloring, and signal reconstruction.

Conclusion: Tractable relaxations and derived algorithms provide effective tools for optimizing sums of bivariates, with insights into different function classes and application potentials.

Abstract: We study the optimization of functions with $n>2$ arguments that have a representation as a sum of several functions that have only $2$ of the $n$ arguments each, termed sums of bivariates, on finite domains. The complexity of optimizing sums of bivariates is shown to be NP-equivalent and it is shown that there exists free lunch in the optimization of sums of bivariates. Based on measure-valued extensions of the objective function, so-called relaxations, $\ell^2$-approximation, and entropy-regularization, we derive several tractable problem formulations solvable with linear programming, coordinate ascent as well as with closed-form solutions. The limits of applying tractable versions of such relaxations to sums of bivariates are investigated using general results for reconstructing measures from their bivariate marginals. Experiments in which the derived algorithms are applied to random functions, vertex coloring, and signal reconstruction problems provide insights into qualitatively different function classes that can be modeled as sums of bivariates.

### [499] [Anytime-Feasible First-Order Optimization via Safe Sequential QCQP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19675)
*Jiarui Wang,Mahyar Fazlyab*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SS-QCQP, a first-order method for nonconvex optimization guaranteeing feasibility at each iteration, accompanied by an active-set variant for scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining feasibility at every step during inequality-constrained nonconvex optimization and reduce computational costs.

Method: Formulating SS-QCQP based on continuous-time dynamics using convex QCQP, ensuring monotonic objective descent and constraint satisfaction, and safeguarding it with discretization and active-set adaptations.

Result: SS-QCQP achieves O(1/t) convergence rates to stationary points and preserves feasibility; demonstrates comparable performance to second-order solvers in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The method ensures feasible optimization with predictable behavior and reduced cost, proving valuable for scalable constrained optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents the Safe Sequential Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (SS-QCQP) algorithm, a first-order method for smooth inequality-constrained nonconvex optimization that guarantees feasibility at every iteration. The method is derived from a continuous-time dynamical system whose vector field is obtained by solving a convex QCQP that enforces monotonic descent of the objective and forward invariance of the feasible set. The resulting continuous-time dynamics achieve an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate to first-order stationary points under standard constraint qualification conditions. We then propose a safeguarded Euler discretization with adaptive step-size selection that preserves this convergence rate while maintaining both descent and feasibility in discrete time. To enhance scalability, we develop an active-set variant (SS-QCQP-AS) that selectively enforces constraints near the boundary, substantially reducing computational cost without compromising theoretical guarantees. Numerical experiments on a multi-agent nonlinear optimal control problem demonstrate that SS-QCQP and SS-QCQP-AS maintain feasibility, exhibit the predicted convergence behavior, and deliver solution quality comparable to second-order solvers such as SQP and IPOPT.

### [500] [Not Quite Anything: Overcoming SAMs Limitations for 3D Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19471)
*Keith Moore*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using foundational segmentation models with an auxiliary input channel to address challenges in MRI brain imaging, achieving high accuracy without fine-tuning the foundation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the limitations of foundation segmentation models like SAM and SAM-2 in brain MRI tasks, particularly for low-contrast structures such as the caudate and thalamus.

Method: They introduce a compositional approach combining a lightweight 3D U-Net (trained on MRIs, potentially from other datasets) to generate prompts for SAM-2 and a process to improve alignment. Prompt-free segmentation with DINO attention maps is also tested.

Result: The method achieves 96 percent volume accuracy on basal ganglia segmentation and proves effective for analyzing longitudinal volume changes, showing robustness and label efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach avoids retraining foundation models, adapts to various domains, and efficiently segments medical images while maintaining accuracy, making it applicable for tasks like studying inflammation in pediatric OCD.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models such as SAM and SAM-2 perform well on natural images but struggle with brain MRIs where structures like the caudate and thalamus lack sharp boundaries and have low contrast. Rather than fine tune these models (for example MedSAM), we propose a compositional alternative where the foundation model output is treated as an additional input channel and passed alongside the MRI to highlight regions of interest.
  We generate SAM-2 prompts by using a lightweight 3D U-Net that was previously trained on MRI segmentation. The U-Net may have been trained on a different dataset, so its guesses are often imprecise but usually in the correct region. The edges of the resulting foundation model guesses are smoothed to improve alignment with the MRI. We also test prompt free segmentation using DINO attention maps in the same framework.
  This has-a architecture avoids modifying foundation weights and adapts to domain shift without retraining the foundation model. It reaches about 96 percent volume accuracy on basal ganglia segmentation, which is sufficient for our study of longitudinal volume change. The approach is fast, label efficient, and robust to out of distribution scans. We apply it to study inflammation linked changes in sudden onset pediatric OCD.

### [501] [A Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework with PKCP-MixUp Augmentation for Pediatric Liver Tumor Diagnosis Using Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19478)
*Wanqi Wang,Chun Yang,Jianbo Shao,Yaokai Zhang,Xuehua Peng,Jin Sun,Chao Xiong,Long Lu,Lianting Hu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper develops a deep learning framework for diagnosing pediatric liver tumors non-invasively using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT, addressing challenges in risk-prone invasive procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of invasive biopsy procedures in diagnosing pediatric liver tumors, which include high complication risks, anesthesia requirements, and challenges specific to young children.

Method: A multi-stage DL framework with a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method was designed. The process included tumor detection using ROIs and a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with different backbones.

Result: The tumor detection model achieved mAP=0.871, and the benign versus malignant classification model achieved AUC=0.989. Final classifiers for benign and malignant subtypes reached AUCs of 0.915 and 0.979, respectively.

Conclusion: The framework provides a non-invasive diagnostic tool specifically designed for pediatric liver tumors, addressing data scarcity and contributing to better CT phase selection and pediatric diagnostics.

Abstract: Pediatric liver tumors are one of the most common solid tumors in pediatrics, with differentiation of benign or malignant status and pathological classification critical for clinical treatment. While pathological examination is the gold standard, the invasive biopsy has notable limitations: the highly vascular pediatric liver and fragile tumor tissue raise complication risks such as bleeding; additionally, young children with poor compliance require anesthesia for biopsy, increasing medical costs or psychological trauma. Although many efforts have been made to utilize AI in clinical settings, most researchers have overlooked its importance in pediatric liver tumors. To establish a non-invasive examination procedure, we developed a multi-stage deep learning (DL) framework for automated pediatric liver tumor diagnosis using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Two retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled. We established a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method to address data scarcity and class imbalance. We also trained a tumor detection model to extract ROIs, and then set a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones with ROI-masked images. Our tumor detection model has achieved high performance (mAP=0.871), and the first stage classification model between benign and malignant tumors reached an excellent performance (AUC=0.989). Final diagnosis models also exhibited robustness, including benign subtype classification (AUC=0.915) and malignant subtype classification (AUC=0.979). We also conducted multi-level comparative analyses, such as ablation studies on data and training pipelines, as well as Shapley-Value and CAM interpretability analyses. This framework fills the pediatric-specific DL diagnostic gap, provides actionable insights for CT phase selection and model design, and paves the way for precise, accessible pediatric liver tumor diagnosis.

### [502] [The Selective Disk Bispectrum and Its Inversion, with Application to Multi-Reference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19706)
*Adele Myers,Nina Miolane*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computationally efficient, rotation-invariant representation for image shape analysis called the selective disk bispectrum. It addresses challenges in learning from image shapes invariant to object orientation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of creating a rotation-invariant representation of images that retains shape information while being computationally efficient and invertible for visualization.

Method: The paper develops the 'selective disk bispectrum,' an optimized version of the traditional disk bispectrum that includes an explicit inverse and uses minimal coefficients for faithful shape recovery.

Result: The selective disk bispectrum enables efficient rotation-invariant image shape analysis and achieves tasks such as multi-reference alignment for rotated images, which were previously infeasible for disk bispectrum methods.

Conclusion: The proposed selective disk bispectrum is a practical and theoretically robust tool for analyzing rotation-invariant shapes in images, enhancing its utility in computer vision and shape analysis applications.

Abstract: In many computer vision and shape analysis tasks, practitioners are interested in learning from the shape of the object in an image, while disregarding the object's orientation. To this end, it is valuable to define a rotation-invariant representation of images, retaining all information about that image, but disregarding the way an object is rotated in the frame. To be practical for learning tasks, this representation must be computationally efficient for large datasets and invertible, so the representation can be visualized in image space. To this end, we present the selective disk bispectrum: a fast, rotation-invariant representation for image shape analysis. While the translational bispectrum has long been used as a translational invariant representation for 1-D and 2-D signals, its extension to 2-D (disk) rotational invariance on images has been hindered by the absence of an invertible formulation and its cubic complexity. In this work, we derive an explicit inverse for the disk bispectrum, which allows us to define a "selective" disk bispectrum, which only uses the minimal number of coefficients needed for faithful shape recovery. We show that this representation enables multi-reference alignment for rotated images-a task previously intractable for disk bispectrum methods. These results establish the disk bispectrum as a practical and theoretically grounded tool for learning on rotation-invariant shape data.

*Jun Jia,Hongyi Miao,Yingjie Zhou,Linhan Cao,Yanwei Jiang,Wangqiu Zhou,Dandan Zhu,Hua Yang,Wei Sun,Xiongkuo Min,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DLADiff, a dual-layer protective mechanism to tackle privacy risks posed by diffusion models in fine-tuning and zero-shot generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is addressing the rising privacy risks associated with diffusion models, especially their ability to generate identities nearly identical to the original with minimal input data.

Method: DLADiff employs a dual-layer protective mechanism: Dual-Surrogate Models (DSUR) and Alternating Dynamic Fine-Tuning (ADFT) combined for fine-tuning defenses, alongside a simple yet effective mechanism against zero-shot generation.

Result: Experimental results show that DLADiff outperforms existing methods in preventing unauthorized fine-tuning and achieves strong protection against zero-shot generation.

Conclusion: DLADiff successfully defends facial privacy against both fine-tuning and zero-shot generation methods, filling current gaps in model customization defenses.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion models, a variety of fine-tuning methods have been developed, enabling high-fidelity image generation with high similarity to the target content using only 3 to 5 training images. More recently, zero-shot generation methods have emerged, capable of producing highly realistic outputs from a single reference image without altering model weights. However, technological advancements have also introduced significant risks to facial privacy. Malicious actors can exploit diffusion model customization with just a few or even one image of a person to create synthetic identities nearly identical to the original identity. Although research has begun to focus on defending against diffusion model customization, most existing defense methods target fine-tuning approaches and neglect zero-shot generation defenses. To address this issue, this paper proposes Dual-Layer Anti-Diffusion (DLADiff) to defense both fine-tuning methods and zero-shot methods. DLADiff contains a dual-layer protective mechanism. The first layer provides effective protection against unauthorized fine-tuning by leveraging the proposed Dual-Surrogate Models (DSUR) mechanism and Alternating Dynamic Fine-Tuning (ADFT), which integrates adversarial training with the prior knowledge derived from pre-fine-tuned models. The second layer, though simple in design, demonstrates strong effectiveness in preventing image generation through zero-shot methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in defending against fine-tuning of diffusion models and achieves unprecedented performance in protecting against zero-shot generation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study aimed at developing a deep learning model (DenseNet121) for automated classification of unerupted maxillary canines, demonstrating its feasibility and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address intra- and inter-operator reproducibility issues in sector classification systems and improve prediction of maxillary canine impaction likelihood through AI.

Method: Radiographs of unerupted maxillary canines assessed using three sector classification systems by orthodontists and general dental practitioners, evaluated for reproducibility. Radiographs were also tested on AI models pre-trained on an extended dataset.

Result: 3-sector system exhibited high reproducibility among human observers (Cohen's K = 0.80-0.92). DenseNet121 achieved an accuracy of 76.8% for AI-based classification.

Conclusion: AI models like DenseNet121 can be utilized for automating the classification of unerupted maxillary canines, complementing manual classification systems.

Abstract: Objectives. The aim of the present study was to develop a fully deep learning model to reduce the intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of sector classification systems for predicting unerupted maxillary canine likelihood of impaction. Methods. Three orthodontists (Os) and three general dental practitioners (GDPs) classified the position of unerupted maxillary canines on 306 radiographs (T0) according to the three different sector classification systems (5-, 4-, and 3-sector classification system). The assessment was repeated after four weeks (T1). Intra- and inter-observer agreement were evaluated with Cohen's K and Fleiss K, and between group differences with a z-test. The same radiographs were tested on different artificial intelligence (AI) models, pre-trained on an extended dataset of 1,222 radiographs. The best-performing model was identified based on its sensitivity and precision. Results. The 3-sector system was found to be the classification method with highest reproducibility, with an agreement (Cohen's K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.80 to 0.92, and an overall agreement of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.87]. The overall inter-observer agreement (Fleiss K) ranged from 0.69 to 0.7. The educational background did not affect either intra- or inter-observer agreement (p>0.05). DenseNet121 proved to be the best-performing model in allocating impacted canines in the three different classes, with an overall accuracy of 76.8%. Conclusion. AI models can be designed to automatically classify the position of unerupted maxillary canines.

### [506] [AI/ML based Joint Source and Channel Coding for HARQ-ACK Payload](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19943)
*Akash Doshi,Pinar Sen,Kirill Ivanov,Wei Yang,June Namgoong,Runxin Wang,Rachel Wang,Taesang Yoo,Jing Jiang,Tingfang Ji*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper addresses the non-uniform distribution of HARQ-ACK bits in the uplink of 5G systems, proposing a transformer-based encoder, power shaping, and a novel decoder design to achieve significant power savings and error rate reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that existing channel coding techniques assume uniformly distributed input bits, which do not hold true for non-uniformly distributed HARQ-ACK bits, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: A transformer-based encoder trained via a novel 'free-lunch' method, per-codeword power shaping, and a Neyman-Pearson test extension for Unequal Error Protection are proposed.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 3-6 dB reduction in average transmit power and 2-3 dB reduction in maximum transmit power, along with significant error rate improvements compared to the NR baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed encoder and decoder design enhances the efficiency of HARQ-ACK bit transmission in 5G, offering significant power savings and improved coverage.

Abstract: Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel "free-lunch" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.

### [507] [Time-Domain Linear Model-based Framework for Passive Acoustic Mapping of Cavitation Activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20551)
*Tatiana Gelvez-Barrera,Barbara Nicolas,Denis Kouamé,Bruno Gilles,Adrian Basarab*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a time-domain linear model for passive acoustic mapping, showcasing improved resolution and data efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome resolution and data efficiency limitations in current passive acoustic mapping methods for therapeutic ultrasound applications.

Method: A linear time-domain model is employed, incorporating spatiotemporal regularization and considering time-of-flight delays, then solved using regularization techniques.

Result: The proposed framework enhances cavitation map quality, requiring just 20% of the data compared to frequency-domain methods and surpasses state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: This model demonstrates significant data efficiency improvements and adaptability, providing an innovative solution for diverse passive cavitation mapping scenarios in therapeutic ultrasound.

Abstract: Passive acoustic mapping enables the spatial mapping and temporal monitoring of cavitation activity, playing a crucial role in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Most conventional beamforming methods, whether implemented in the time or frequency domains, suffer from limited axial resolution due to the absence of a reference emission onset time. While frequency-domain methods, the most efficient of which are based on the cross-spectral matrix, require long signals for accurate estimation, time-domain methods typically achieve lower spatial resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a linear model-based beamforming framework fully formulated in the time domain. The linear forward model relates a discretized spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation activity to the temporal signals recorded by a probe, explicitly accounting for time-of-flight delays dictated by the acquisition geometry. This model is then inverted using regularization techniques that exploit prior knowledge of cavitation activity in both spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves enhanced or competitive cavitation map quality while using only 20\% of the data typically required by frequency-domain methods. This highlights the substantial gain in data efficiency and the flexibility of our spatiotemporal regularization to adapt to diverse passive cavitation scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

*Simin Zhu,Satish Ravindran,Alexander Yarovoy,Francesco Fioranelli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This study proposes a neural network method to simultaneously segment static and moving objects in radar point clouds and estimate instantaneous vehicle motion, tested on the RadarScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in radar segmentation focusing on category labels and instead prioritize differentiating static and moving objects, a requirement for many automotive radar tasks.

Method: The approach uses a neural network with MLPs and RNNs to process radar point clouds directly, extracting dual-task information without intermediate signal processing or data transformations.

Result: The method was evaluated on the real-world RadarScenes dataset, achieving strong dual-task performance, and introduced novel evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the method is feasible, effective, and broadly applicable for radar perception tasks, demonstrating promising results for static and moving object segmentation and ego-motion estimation.

Abstract: Conventional radar segmentation research has typically focused on learning category labels for different moving objects. Although fundamental differences between radar and optical sensors lead to differences in the reliability of predicting accurate and consistent category labels, a review of common radar perception tasks in automotive reveals that determining whether an object is moving or static is a prerequisite for most tasks. To fill this gap, this study proposes a neural network based solution that can simultaneously segment static and moving objects from radar point clouds. Furthermore, since the measured radial velocity of static objects is correlated with the motion of the radar, this approach can also estimate the instantaneous 2D velocity of the moving platform or vehicle (ego motion). However, despite performing dual tasks, the proposed method employs very simple yet effective building blocks for feature extraction: multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In addition to being the first of its kind in the literature, the proposed method also demonstrates the feasibility of extracting the information required for the dual task directly from unprocessed point clouds, without the need for cloud aggregation, Doppler compensation, motion compensation, or any other intermediate signal processing steps. To measure its performance, this study introduces a set of novel evaluation metrics and tests the proposed method using a challenging real world radar dataset, RadarScenes. The results show that the proposed method not only performs well on the dual tasks, but also has broad application potential in other radar perception tasks.

### [509] [Heckman Selection Contaminated Normal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12348)
*Heeju Lim,Jose Alejandro Ordonez,Victor H. Lachos,Antonio Punzo*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper extends the traditional Heckman selection model by using a bivariate contaminated normal distribution to address heavy tails and atypical observations, accompanied by an efficient parameter estimation algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the limitations of the traditional Heckman model, which assumes bivariate normal errors, failing under real data scenarios with heavy tails or atypical observations.

Method: A novel Heckman selection model is introduced using a bivariate contaminated normal distribution. An ECM (Expectation Conditional Maximization) algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation with closed-form expressions at the E-step.

Result: Simulations and real data analyses demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the traditional normal and Student's t-based Heckman models. The model's effectiveness is further supported by its implementation in the R package HeckmanEM.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a flexible and robust alternative to the existing Heckman models, addressing sample selection bias effectively in challenging data conditions.

Abstract: The Heckman selection model is one of the most well-renounced econometric models in the analysis of data with sample selection. This model is designed to rectify sample selection biases based on the assumption of bivariate normal error terms. However, real data diverge from this assumption in the presence of heavy tails and/or atypical observations. Recently, this assumption has been relaxed via a more flexible Student's t-distribution, which has appealing statistical properties. This paper introduces a novel Heckman selection model using a bivariate contaminated normal distribution for the error terms. We present an efficient ECM algorithm for parameter estimation with closed-form expressions at the E-step based on truncated multinormal distribution formulas. The identifiability of the proposed model is also discussed, and its properties have been examined. Through simulation studies, we compare our proposed model with the normal and Student's t counterparts and investigate the finite-sample properties and the variation in missing rate. Results obtained from two real data analyses showcase the usefulness and effectiveness of our model. The proposed algorithms are implemented in the R package HeckmanEM.

### [510] [Order Selection in Vector Autoregression by Mean Square Information Criterion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19761)
*Michael Hellstern,Ali Shojaie*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Mean Square Information Criterion (MIC) as a new approach to determine the order selection in Vector Autoregressive (VAR) processes and demonstrates its consistency and performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Order selection in VAR processes is crucial but challenging due to the limitations in existing methods like AIC, BIC, and HQ, which either overestimate or require large sample sizes to be effective.

Method: The authors propose MIC, which leverages the relationship between fitted order and squared error loss, and validate it using simulations and case studies, such as COVID-19 outcomes in New York City.

Result: MIC consistently estimates the order with better performance compared to AIC, BIC, and HQ, particularly under model misspecifications.

Conclusion: MIC is a robust and reliable method for VAR order selection, as evidenced by simulation and real-world applications, and is available for implementation through the micvar R package.

Abstract: Vector autoregressive (VAR) processes are ubiquitously used in economics, finance, and biology. Order selection is an essential step in fitting VAR models. While many order selection methods exist, all come with weaknesses. Order selection by minimizing AIC is a popular approach but is known to consistently overestimate the true order for processes of small dimension. On the other hand, methods based on BIC or the Hannan-Quinn (HQ) criteria are shown to require large sample sizes in order to accurately estimate the order for larger-dimensional processes. We propose the mean square information criterion (MIC) based on the observation that the expected squared error loss is flat once the fitted order reaches or exceeds the true order. MIC is shown to consistently estimate the order of the process under relatively mild conditions. Our simulation results show that MIC offers better performance relative to AIC, BIC, and HQ under misspecification. This advantage is corroborated when forecasting COVID-19 outcomes in New York City. Order selection by MIC is implemented in the micvar R package available on CRAN.

TL;DR: This paper discusses integrating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world data (RWD) with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to enhance evidence generation for drug development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of RCTs, such as cost, duration, and restrictive criteria, and leveraging the increasing potential of RWD and AI/ML to create more robust, scalable, and flexible methodologies for evidence generation.

Method: The paper advocates for a principled integration of RCTs, RWD, and AI/ML through a causal roadmap that clarifies inferential goals, makes assumptions explicit, and ensures transparency about tradeoffs.

Result: Key objectives are outlined, including extending RCT findings to wider populations, embedding AI analyses in trials, and leveraging hybrid trials. Future directions include privacy-preserving analytics and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: Integrating statistical rigor with AI/ML innovation offers robust and policy-relevant evidence generation, representing a transformative step in modern regulatory science.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been the cornerstone of clinical evidence; however, their cost, duration, and restrictive eligibility criteria limit power and external validity. Studies using real-world data (RWD), historically considered less reliable for establishing causality, are now recognized to be important for generating real-world evidence (RWE). In parallel, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are being increasingly used throughout the drug development process, providing scalability and flexibility but also presenting challenges in interpretability and rigor that traditional statistics do not face. This Perspective argues that the future of evidence generation will not depend on RCTs versus RWD, or statistics versus AI/ML, but on their principled integration. To this end, a causal roadmap is needed to clarify inferential goals, make assumptions explicit, and ensure transparency about tradeoffs. We highlight key objectives of integrative evidence synthesis, including transporting RCT results to broader populations, embedding AI-assisted analyses within RCTs, designing hybrid controlled trials, and extending short-term RCTs with long-term RWD. We also outline future directions in privacy-preserving analytics, uncertainty quantification, and small-sample methods. By uniting statistical rigor with AI/ML innovation, integrative approaches can produce robust, transparent, and policy-relevant evidence, making them a key component of modern regulatory science.

*Xiangyu Zhao,Yaling Shen,Yiwen Jiang,Zimu Wang,Jiahe Liu,Maxmartwell H Cheng,Guilherme C Oliveira,Robert Desimone,Dominic Dwyer,Zongyuan Ge*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection, improving temporal alignment and multi-modal understanding using audio and visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address current limitations of LLMs in integrating non-verbal cues critical for depression detection and fill the gap in psychological-focused multimodal LLMs.

Method: A framework that augments an audio-language model with visual understanding, aligning audio-visual features at the timestamp level for fine-grained analysis.

Result: The proposed model outperformed existing single-modality and multi-modal methods, validated on the DAIC-WoZ dataset.

Conclusion: This framework introduces a promising multi-modal approach for depression detection and can extend its application to broader healthcare settings.

Abstract: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally. In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.

*Davide Picca*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semiotic framework to analyze Large Language Models using information theory, focusing on the trade-off between expressive richness (breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability). It offers empirical tools for understanding and enhancing communication through LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a structured and rigorous framework for understanding and evaluating the outputs of Large Language Models in terms of their communicative and interpretive capacities.

Method: The paper employs an information-theoretic approach, introducing concepts like generative complexity parameter (lambda), semiotic channels, and operational constraints on meaning transmission. Empirical measures are used to study the trade-off dynamics.

Result: The framework provides tools and insights for profiling LLMs, improving prompt design, assessing risks of ambiguous communication, and developing adaptive systems. It positions language analysis on textual outputs rather than complex model internals.

Conclusion: This semiotic channel approach enhances our ability to optimize LLM-mediated communication, offering applicable tools for evaluation, design, and risk analysis in a systematic way.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel semiotic framework for analyzing Large Language Models (LLMs), conceptualizing them as stochastic semiotic engines whose outputs demand active, asymmetric human interpretation. We formalize the trade-off between expressive richness (semiotic breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability) using information-theoretic tools. Breadth is quantified as source entropy, and decipherability as the mutual information between messages and human interpretations. We introduce a generative complexity parameter (lambda) that governs this trade-off, as both breadth and decipherability are functions of lambda. The core trade-off is modeled as an emergent property of their distinct responses to $λ$. We define a semiotic channel, parameterized by audience and context, and posit a capacity constraint on meaning transmission, operationally defined as the maximum decipherability by optimizing lambda. This reframing shifts analysis from opaque model internals to observable textual artifacts, enabling empirical measurement of breadth and decipherability. We demonstrate the framework's utility across four key applications: (i) model profiling; (ii) optimizing prompt/context design; (iii) risk analysis based on ambiguity; and (iv) adaptive semiotic systems. We conclude that this capacity-based semiotic approach offers a rigorous, actionable toolkit for understanding, evaluating, and designing LLM-mediated communication.

### [514] [Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: Understanding (In-)Completeness of Proof Mechanisms for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20193)
*Neta Elad,Adithya Murali,Sharon Shoham*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitations of automated proof mechanisms in Separation Logic and introduces Weak Separation Logic (WSL), a complete framework for certain quantified entailments. It analyzes proof failures using nonstandard models and presents a prototype tool to identify these failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a better understanding of the incompleteness and proof failures in Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID), given its importance in reasoning about heap-manipulating programs and shared resources.

Method: The authors extend SLID to a broader framework called Weak Separation Logic (WSL), prove its completeness for specific cases, and analyze proof failures through nonstandard models using symbolic structures. They also develop a prototype tool for identifying rogue models.

Result: The paper shows WSL's completeness for certain entailments, demonstrates the soundness and completeness of fold/unfold mechanisms within WSL without theories, and reveals the presence of rogue models causing proof failures. The prototype tool successfully identifies counter-models in a benchmark with over 700 problems.

Conclusion: Weak Separation Logic helps address certain limitations of SLID, providing insights into proof failures and advancing automated reasoning for heap-based programs.

Abstract: For over two decades Separation Logic has been arguably the most popular framework for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs, as well as reasoning about shared resources and permissions. Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning.
  In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them.
  We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.

TL;DR: The paper discusses extending a method for proving strong equivalence between answer set programs to those containing counting aggregates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the understanding and verification of strong equivalence in answer set programming when programs involve counting aggregates.

Method: The method involves extending existing deductive systems for proving strong equivalence to accommodate programs with counting aggregate expressions.

Result: The paper provides a systematic approach and framework for establishing strong equivalence even in the presence of counting aggregates.

Conclusion: Strong equivalence verification in answer set programming can be extended and applied effectively to programs involving counting aggregates.

Abstract: In answer set programming, two groups of rules are considered strongly equivalent if they have the same meaning in any context. Strong equivalence of two programs can be sometimes established by deriving rules of each program from rules of the other in an appropriate deductive system. This paper shows how to extend this method of proving strong equivalence to programs containing the counting aggregate.

TL;DR: RECCS+ and RECCS++ are enhanced versions of RECCS for synthetic network generation, introducing parallelization and optimizations to achieve substantial speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of evaluating community detection algorithms due to the lack of labeled ground truth in real networks by enhancing synthetic network generation methods.

Method: The authors enhance RECCS with RECCS+ employing parallelization with an orchestrator, and RECCS++ adding further algorithmic optimizations, enabling significant performance improvements.

Result: Experimental results show speedups of up to 49x for RECCS+ and 139x for RECCS++, with RECCS++ scaling to networks with over 100 million nodes and modest accuracy tradeoff.

Conclusion: RECCS++ offers substantial improvements in scalability and speed, making it better suited for large-scale networks while balancing performance and accuracy.

Abstract: Community detection, or network clustering, is used to identify latent community structure in networks. Due to the scarcity of labeled ground truth in real-world networks, evaluating these algorithms poses significant challenges. To address this, researchers use synthetic network generators that produce networks with ground-truth community labels. RECCS is one such algorithm that takes a network and its clustering as input and generates a synthetic network through a modular pipeline. Each generated ground truth cluster preserves key characteristics of the corresponding input cluster, including connectivity, minimum degree, and degree sequence distribution. The output consists of a synthetically generated network, and disjoint ground truth cluster labels for all nodes. In this paper, we present two enhanced versions: RECCS+ and RECCS++. RECCS+ maintains algorithmic fidelity to the original RECCS while introducing parallelization through an orchestrator that coordinates algorithmic components across multiple processes and employs multithreading. RECCS++ builds upon this foundation with additional algorithmic optimizations to achieve further speedup. Our experimental results demonstrate that RECCS+ and RECCS++ achieve speedups of up to 49x and 139x respectively on our benchmark datasets, with RECCS++'s additional performance gains involving a modest accuracy tradeoff. With this newfound performance, RECCS++ can now scale to networks with over 100 million nodes and nearly 2 billion edges.

*Debabrata Auddya,Shiva Rudraraju*

TL;DR: This study presents a model for understanding the mechano-chemical interactions in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), focusing on secondary injury caused by glia and chemical species evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capture and model the complex pathways of TBI, particularly secondary injuries initiated by glial activity, to aid in developing better treatments.

Method: A continuum framework involving a coupled PDE and FEM discretization, modeling neurons, microglia, and extracellular matrix as a viscoelastic network alongside advection-diffusion equations.

Result: Numerical estimations of chemical species concentrations linked to strain fields, providing insights into biomarkers and injury mechanics.

Conclusion: This framework provides a detailed understanding of secondary injuries in TBI and aims to assist in creating targeted therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) results from an impact or concussion to the head with the injury being specifically characterized through pathological degradation at various biological length scales. Following injury, various mechanical modeling techniques have been proposed in the literature that seek to quantify neuronal-scale to tissue-scale metrics of brain damage. Broadly, the two categories of degradation encompass physiological deterioration of neurons and upregulation of chemical entities such as neurotransmitters which causes initiation of downstream pathophysiological effects. Despite the many contributing pathways, in this work, we delineate and model a potential glia-initiated injury pathway that leads to secondary injury. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a continuum framework which models the multiphysics of mechano-chemical interactions underlying TBI. Using a coupled PDE (partial differential equation) formulation and FEM (finite element method) discretization, the framework highlights evolution of field variables which spatio-temporally resolve mechanical metrics and chemical species across neuronal clusters. The modeling domain encompasses microglia, neurons and the extracellular matrix. The continuum framework used to model the mechano-chemical interactions assumes a three dimensional viscoelastic network to capture the mechanical response underlying proteins constituting the neuron microstructure and advection-diffusion equations modeling spatio-temporal evolution of chemical species. We use this framework to numerically estimate key concentrations of chemical species produced by the strain field. In this work, we identify key biomarkers within the labyrinth of molecular pathways and build a framework that captures the core mechano-chemical interactions. This framework is an attempt to quantify secondary injury and thus assist in developing targeted TBI treatments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DKAN, a model to improve spatial gene expression prediction from histopathological images using biologically-informed methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial Transcriptomics is limited by high costs, necessitating predictive methods for spatial gene expression using whole slide images, which face issues with context exploitation and cross-modal alignment.

Method: The authors developed DKAN, integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles using gene semantic representation modules and contrastive learning techniques.

Result: DKAN outperformed state-of-the-art models in experiments on three public datasets, setting new benchmarks in spatial gene expression prediction.

Conclusion: DKAN represents a significant advancement in predicting spatial gene expression and holds potential for enhancing biological and clinical research.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate diagnosis of spitzoid tumors is essential, but current tools do not handle missing DNA methylation data effectively, a common issue in real-world datasets.

Method: ReMAC, an extension of ReMasker, is designed for classifying high-dimensional data under both complete and incomplete conditions.

Result: ReMAC demonstrates strong performance on real clinical datasets, outperforming competing classification methods for ST diagnosis.

Conclusion: ReMAC is a robust tool that improves ST classification using incomplete DNA methylation data, addressing a significant gap in diagnostics.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of spitzoid tumors (ST) is critical to ensure a favorable prognosis and to avoid both under- and over-treatment. Epigenetic data, particularly DNA methylation, provide a valuable source of information for this task. However, prior studies assume complete data, an unrealistic setting as methylation profiles frequently contain missing entries due to limited coverage and experimental artifacts. Our work challenges these favorable scenarios and introduces ReMAC, an extension of ReMasker designed to tackle classification tasks on high-dimensional data under complete and incomplete regimes. Evaluation on real clinical data demonstrates that ReMAC achieves strong and robust performance compared to competing classification methods in the stratification of ST.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nirvana, a multi-modal data analytics framework employing LLMs and optimizing semantic-aware queries for enhanced efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data analytics lack semantic-aware systems, limiting the applications' ability to deliver across diverse domains like e-commerce and healthcare. Emerging LLMs can bridge this gap.

Method: Nirvana integrates programmable semantic operators with logical and physical optimization strategies, using innovative approaches like natural language transformation rules, random-walk searches, computation reuse, and improvement-score metrics for backends.

Result: Achieved reductions in runtime by 10%-85% and processing costs by 76% on average across benchmarks, surpassing existing systems in efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: By leveraging LLMs in a tailored optimization framework, Nirvana provides a transformative advancement in multi-modal data analytics, enabling semantic-aware processing and practical deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal analytical processing has the potential to transform applications in e-commerce, healthcare, entertainment, and beyond. However, real-world adoption remains elusive due to the limited ability of traditional relational query operators to capture query semantics. The emergence of foundation models, particularly the large language models (LLMs), opens up new opportunities to develop flexible, semantic-aware data analytics systems that transcend the relational paradigm.
  We present Nirvana, a multi-modal data analytics framework that incorporates programmable semantic operators while leveraging both logical and physical query optimization strategies, tailored for LLM-driven semantic query processing. Nirvana addresses two key challenges. First, it features an agentic logical optimizer that uses natural language-specified transformation rules and random-walk-based search to explore vast spaces of semantically equivalent query plans -- far beyond the capabilities of conventional optimizers. Second, it introduces a cost-aware physical optimizer that selects the most effective LLM backend for each operator using a novel improvement-score metric. To further enhance efficiency, Nirvana incorporates computation reuse and evaluation pushdown techniques guided by model capability hypotheses. Experimental evaluations on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that Nirvana is able to reduce end-to-end runtime by 10%--85% and reduces system processing costs by 76% on average, outperforming state-of-the-art systems at both efficiency and scalability.

*Chaowei He,Yuanjun Liu,Qingzhi Ma,Shenyuan Ren,Xizhao Luo,Lei Zhao,An Liu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cardinality Estimation Pruning (CEP) for machine unlearning in multi-table learned cardinality estimation systems, addressing challenges like sensitivity, inter-table propagation, and domain disappearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are unique challenges in performing machine unlearning in learned cardinality estimation systems, especially with complexities like distributional dependencies and inaccurate predictions post data deletion.

Method: CEP leverages Distribution Sensitivity Pruning and Domain Pruning techniques for effective unlearning, guiding parameter pruning and removing eliminated value domains, tested on NeuroCard and FACE architectures.

Result: CEP achieves superior Q-error in multi-table scenarios at high deletion ratios and outperforms traditional retraining methods, with minimal computational overhead of 0.3%-2.5%.

Conclusion: CEP is an effective and computationally efficient framework for machine unlearning in learned cardinality estimation systems with promising performance across datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in learned cardinality estimation (CE) systems presents unique challenges due to the complex distributional dependencies in multi-table relational data. Specifically, data deletion, a core component of machine unlearning, faces three critical challenges in learned CE models: attribute-level sensitivity, inter-table propagation and domain disappearance leading to severe overestimation in multi-way joins. We propose Cardinality Estimation Pruning (CEP), the first unlearning framework specifically designed for multi-table learned CE systems. CEP introduces Distribution Sensitivity Pruning, which constructs semi-join deletion results and computes sensitivity scores to guide parameter pruning, and Domain Pruning, which removes support for value domains entirely eliminated by deletion. We evaluate CEP on state-of-the-art architectures NeuroCard and FACE across IMDB and TPC-H datasets. Results demonstrate CEP consistently achieves the lowest Q-error in multi-table scenarios, particularly under high deletion ratios, often outperforming full retraining. Furthermore, CEP significantly reduces convergence iterations, incurring negligible computational overhead of 0.3%-2.5% of fine-tuning time.

### [523] [InferF: Declarative Factorization of AI/ML Inferences over Joins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20489)
*Kanchan Chowdhury,Lixi Zhou,Lulu Xie,Xinwei Fu,Jia Zou*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Factorized ML offers a way to optimize AI/ML workflows by reducing redundancy in computations caused by multi-way data joins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI/ML inference suffers from computational inefficiencies due to redundant joins in feature vectors from multiple datasets. Factorized ML aims to address this issue but lacks comprehensive exploration of its impact on multi-way joins.

Method: The paper introduces InferF, a declarative system that factorizes inference workflows over multi-way joins using formalized computation strategies, including two algorithms: a greedy algorithm based on latency cost function and a genetic algorithm for evaluating factorization plans.

Result: InferF was implemented on Meta's Velox database engine and tested on real-world datasets, achieving up to 11.3x speedup in inference computations.

Conclusion: Factorized ML and the InferF system significantly reduce AI/ML inference workflow inefficiencies by optimizing computation and join costs, presenting promising opportunities for elevated performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Real-world AI/ML workflows often apply inference computations to feature vectors joined from multiple datasets. To avoid the redundant AI/ML computations caused by repeated data records in the join's output, factorized ML has been proposed to decompose ML computations into sub-computations to be executed on each normalized dataset. However, there is insufficient discussion on how factorized ML could impact AI/ML inference over multi-way joins. To address the limitations, we propose a novel declarative InferF system, focusing on the factorization of arbitrary inference workflows represented as analyzable expressions over the multi-way joins. We formalize our problem to flexibly push down partial factorized computations to qualified nodes in the join tree to minimize the overall inference computation and join costs and propose two algorithms to resolve the problem: (1) a greedy algorithm based on a per-node cost function that estimates the influence on overall latency if a subset of factorized computations is pushed to a node, and (2) a genetic algorithm for iteratively enumerating and evaluating promising factorization plans. We implement InferF on Velox, an open-sourced database engine from Meta, evaluate it on real-world datasets, observed up to 11.3x speedups, and systematically summarized the factors that determine when factorized ML can benefit AI/ML inference workflows.

### [524] [An Infinite BART model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20087)
*Marco Battiston,Yu Luo*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Infinite BART, a generalization of Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), optimizing tree selection and enabling clustering of observations for better regression function modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in classic BART, including rigid decision tree count and inability to account for data heterogeneity.

Method: The model incorporates a binary weight matrix with an Indian Buffet process prior, enabling automatic tree selection and clustering in the conditional distribution. Parameters are sampled using MCMC.

Result: Infinite BART was tested on simulated and real data, showing improvements in variable importance, partial dependence, and causal estimation compared to classic BART.

Conclusion: Infinite BART enhances the flexibility and accuracy of the BART framework by allowing data-driven tree selection and observation-specific regression modeling.

Abstract: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) are popular Bayesian ensemble models used in regression and classification analysis. Under this modeling framework, the regression function is approximated by an ensemble of decision trees, interpreted as weak learners that capture different features of the data. In this work, we propose a generalization of the BART model that has two main features: first, it automatically selects the number of decision trees using the given data; second, the model allows clusters of observations to have different regression functions since each data point can only use a selection of weak learners, instead of all of them. This model generalization is accomplished by including a binary weight matrix in the conditional distribution of the response variable, which activates only a specific subset of decision trees for each observation. Such a matrix is endowed with an Indian Buffet process prior, and sampled within the MCMC sampler, together with the other BART parameters. We then compare the Infinite BART model with the classic one on simulated and real datasets. Specifically, we provide examples illustrating variable importance, partial dependence and causal estimation.

*Alexandre Epalle,Isabelle Ramière,Guillaume Latu,Frédéric Lebon*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) strategy tailored for solving 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems efficiently and scalably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance simulations and overcome limitations in performance for solving complex 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems.

Method: A combination of node-to-node pairing with penalization techniques, non-conforming h-adaptive refinement, and parallel framework implementations with an optimized mesh partitioning strategy.

Result: The strategy is tested in 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems, showing robust convergence analyses, scalable parallel performance up to 1024 cores, and efficient memory management.

Conclusion: The developed approach demonstrates high efficiency, scalability, and robustness in handling elastostatic contact problems with adaptive refinement in parallel computation frameworks.

Abstract: Parallel implementation of numerical adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)strategies for solving 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems is an essential step toward complex simulations that exceed current performance levels. This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed.

*Mitchell Scott,Tianshi Xu,Ziyuan Tang,Alexandra Pichette-Emmons,Qiang Ye,Yousef Saad,Yuanzhe Xi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper explores the optimization of SGD by leveraging preconditioned geometries to improve efficiency and stability, focusing on noise reduction and effective conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of slow convergence in SGD due to anisotropic curvature and gradient noise by exploiting preconditioning methods.

Method: Develops preconditioned SGD using a symmetric positive definite matrix $mathbf{M}$, analyzes its impact on convergence rates, noise floor, and basin-stability in SciML tasks.

Result: Demonstrates that effective conditioning and noise attenuation through $mathbf{M}$ improve training performance, supported by theoretical bounds and experimental results.

Conclusion: Preconditioning in SGD enhances convergence rates and noise management, providing valuable insights for SciML applications and optimization design principles.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) often slows in the late stage of training due to anisotropic curvature and gradient noise. We analyze preconditioned SGD in the geometry induced by a symmetric positive definite matrix $\mathbf{M}$, deriving bounds in which both the convergence rate and the stochastic noise floor are governed by $\mathbf{M}$-dependent quantities: the rate through an effective condition number in the $\mathbf{M}$-metric, and the floor through the product of that condition number and the preconditioned noise level. For nonconvex objectives, we establish a preconditioner-dependent basin-stability guarantee: when smoothness and basin size are measured in the $\mathbf{M}$-norm, the probability that the iterates remain in a well-behaved local region admits an explicit lower bound. This perspective is particularly relevant in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), where achieving small training loss under stochastic updates is closely tied to physical fidelity, numerical stability, and constraint satisfaction. The framework applies to both diagonal/adaptive and curvature-aware preconditioners and yields a simple design principle: choose $\mathbf{M}$ to improve local conditioning while attenuating noise. Experiments on a quadratic diagnostic and three SciML benchmarks validate the predicted rate-floor behavior.

TL;DR: This research addresses noise-robust neural operator approximations for solving Calderón's inverse conductivity problem in electrical impedance tomography (EIT), using a novel neural operator-based methodology backed by numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the capability of solving Calderón's inverse conductivity problem in EIT under noisy measurement conditions using neural operator frameworks.

Method: The study extends the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions, ensuring stability and enabling Fourier neural operator approximations. It focuses on reconstructing conductivities under noisy scenarios.

Result: Fourier neural operators demonstrated excellent performance in reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities, both within theoretical bounds and in more general noisy conditions.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a noise-aware neural operator learning framework for nonlinear inverse problems in EIT, which may also generalize to other nonlinear inverse problems.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of noise-robust neural operator approximation for the solution map of Calderón's inverse conductivity problem. In this continuum model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the boundary measurements are realized as a noisy perturbation of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map's integral kernel. The theoretical analysis proceeds by extending the domain of the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions. The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions. The methodology developed in this paper for EIT exemplifies a broader strategy for addressing nonlinear inverse problems with a noise-aware operator learning framework.

*Stefan Perko*

TL;DR: The thesis extends the theory of stochastic modified equations (SMEs) and introduces novel diffusion approximations for SGD without replacement using epoched Brownian motion (EBM) and scaling limit studies of random walks (RW).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work seeks to enhance the theoretical understanding of stochastic gradient algorithms, particularly focusing on improving approximation accuracy and providing continuous-time models for stochastic methods in optimization.

Method: The thesis provides mathematical proofs of approximation properties, formulates novel models using epoched Brownian motion, and uses scaling limits of random walks to study permutations and their covariance effects.

Result: It proves weak approximation properties, defines the EBM and its application to SGDo, derives convergence properties, and shows EBMs as limits of random walks with specific permutations.

Conclusion: The findings strengthen the theoretical foundation of SGD-type algorithms, introducing new tools and perspectives to analyze and improve their performance.

Abstract: In this thesis, we extend the recently introduced theory of stochastic modified equations (SMEs) for stochastic gradient optimization algorithms.
  In Ch. 3 we study time-inhomogeneous SDEs driven by Brownian motion. For certain SDEs we prove a 1st and 2nd-order weak approximation properties, and we compute their linear error terms explicitly, under certain regularity conditions. In Ch. 4 we instantiate our results for SGD, working out the example of linear regression explicitly. We use this example to compare the linear error terms of gradient flow and two commonly used 1st-order SMEs for SGD in Ch. 5.
  In the second part of the thesis we introduce and study a novel diffusion approximation for SGD without replacement (SGDo) in the finite-data setting. In Ch. 6 we motivate and define the notion of an epoched Brownian motion (EBM). We argue that Young differential equations (YDEs) driven by EBMs serve as continuous-time models for SGDo for any shuffling scheme whose induced permutations converge to a det. permuton. Further, we prove a.s. convergence for these YDEs in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we compute an upper asymptotic bound on the convergence rate which is as sharp as, or better than previous results for SGDo. In Ch. 7 we study scaling limits of families of random walks (RW) that share the same increments up to a random permutation. We show weak convergence under the assumption that the sequence of permutations converges to a det. (higher-dimensional) permuton. This permuton determines the covariance function of the limiting Gaussian process. Conversely, we show that every Gaussian process with a covariance function determined by a permuton in this way arises as a weak scaling limit of families of RW with shared increments. Finally, we apply our weak convergence theory to show that EBMs arise as scaling limits of RW with finitely many distinct increments.

*Kenta Yamamoto,Teruaki Hayashi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving trust and quality assurance in data marketplaces using simulations and reputation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for high-quality cross-domain datasets and reliable data marketplaces due to the rise in data trading and data as an economic asset.

Method: A multi-agent data-market simulator was designed using reinforcement learning (RL) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to study behavior and evaluate reputation mechanisms.

Result: PeerTrust was found to be the most effective reputation system for aligning data price and quality while avoiding monopolistic dominance; a hybrid reputation mechanism was further developed for market stability.

Conclusion: Simulations can enhance the understanding of trust and reputation mechanisms, leading to more reliable and efficient data markets.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning and big data analytics have intensified the demand for high-quality cross-domain datasets and accelerated the growth of data trading across organizations. As data become increasingly recognized as an economic asset, data marketplaces have emerged as a key infrastructure for data-driven innovation. However, unlike mature product or service markets, data-trading environments remain nascent and suffer from pronounced information asymmetry. Buyers cannot verify the content or quality before purchasing data, making trust and quality assurance central challenges. To address these issues, this study develops a multi-agent data-market simulator that models participant behavior and evaluates the institutional mechanisms for trust formation. Focusing on the manufacturing sector, where initiatives such as GAIA-X and Catena-X are advancing, the simulator integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive agent behavior and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate utility functions from empirical behavioral data. Using the simulator, we examine the market-level effects of five representative reputation systems-Time-decay, Bayesian-beta, PageRank, PowerTrust, and PeerTrust-and found that PeerTrust achieved the strongest alignment between data price and quality, while preventing monopolistic dominance. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid reputation mechanism that integrates the strengths of existing systems to achieve improved price-quality consistency and overall market stability. This study extends simulation-based data-market analysis by incorporating trust and reputation as endogenous mechanisms and offering methodological and institutional insights into the design of reliable and efficient data ecosystems.

*Shitao Fan,Ilsang Ohn,David Dunson,Lizhen Lin*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: A novel variational bagging method is introduced to enhance variational Bayes inference by combining bagging procedures with the mean-field method, improving uncertainty quantification and parameter dependency capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation in mean-field variational posterior methods where parameter dependencies are ignored, leading to underestimated uncertainty.

Method: The paper integrates a bagging procedure within variational Bayes, creating a bagged variational posterior. Theoretical analyses ensure posterior contraction rates, BVM theorem validation, and improved uncertainty quantification.

Result: The approach successfully captured off-diagonal covariance elements for accurate uncertainty quantification, was robust against model misspecification, and matched target covariance structures. Applications extended to models such as finite mixture models, deep neural networks, and VAEs.

Conclusion: Variational bagging offers computational benefits, improves inference reliability even in mean-field settings, and is applicable across diverse models under theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Variational Bayes methods are popular due to their computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse applications. In specifying the variational family, mean-field classes are commonly used, which enables efficient algorithms such as coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) but fails to capture parameter dependence and typically underestimates uncertainty. In this work, we introduce a variational bagging approach that integrates a bagging procedure with variational Bayes, resulting in a bagged variational posterior for improved inference. We establish strong theoretical guarantees, including posterior contraction rates for general models and a Bernstein-von Mises (BVM) type theorem that ensures valid uncertainty quantification. Notably, our results show that even when using a mean-field variational family, our approach can recover off-diagonal elements of the limiting covariance structure and provide proper uncertainty quantification. In addition, variational bagging is robust to model misspecification, with covariance structures matching those of the target covariance. We illustrate our variational bagging method in numerical studies through applications to parametric models, finite mixture models, deep neural networks, and variational autoencoders (VAEs).

Motivation: To overcome the limitation in developing organic photovoltaic materials due to difficulty in identifying donor and acceptor pairs with strong power conversion efficiencies.

Method: The authors created OPV2D dataset of 2000 donor-acceptor pairs, and developed tools like OPVC, a hierarchical graph neural network, MOE2 for energy level prediction, P3 for performance estimation, and MatGPT for generating materials through reinforcement learning.

Result: The framework links molecular representation learning with performance prediction, enabling data-driven discovery of high-performance OPV materials.

Conclusion: This work advances the discovery of sustainable energy materials by integrating predictive and generative machine learning methodologies.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials offer a promising path toward sustainable energy generation, but their development is limited by the difficulty of identifying high performance donor and acceptor pairs with strong power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Existing design strategies typically focus on either the donor or the acceptor alone, rather than using a unified approach capable of modeling both components. In this work, we introduce a dual machine learning framework for OPV discovery that combines predictive modeling with generative molecular design. We present the Organic Photovoltaic Donor Acceptor Dataset (OPV2D), the largest curated dataset of its kind, containing 2000 experimentally characterized donor acceptor pairs. Using this dataset, we develop the Organic Photovoltaic Classifier (OPVC) to predict whether a material exhibits OPV behavior, and a hierarchical graph neural network that incorporates multi task learning and donor acceptor interaction modeling. This framework includes the Molecular Orbital Energy Estimator (MOE2) for predicting HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and the Photovoltaic Performance Predictor (P3) for estimating PCE. In addition, we introduce the Material Generative Pretrained Transformer (MatGPT) to produce synthetically accessible organic semiconductors, guided by a reinforcement learning strategy with three objective policy optimization. By linking molecular representation learning with performance prediction, our framework advances data driven discovery of high performance OPV materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address optimal control problems with explicit consideration of probabilistic constraints on state failures, without relying on conservative approximations.

Method: The chance constraint is integrated into the cost function using a dual formulation derived from stochastic calculus and expressed via a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE. The Path integral approach is applied for solving the dual problem numerically using gradient ascent.

Result: Simulation studies on mobile robot navigation show success in solving the chance-constrained problem, and results are compared with finite difference methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of the developed dual formulation and Path integral approach for addressing chance-constrained SOC problems, contributing to motion planning applications.

Abstract: The paper addresses a continuous-time continuous-space chance-constrained stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem where the probability of failure to satisfy given state constraints is explicitly bounded. We leverage the notion of exit time from continuous-time stochastic calculus to formulate a chance-constrained SOC problem. Without any conservative approximation, the chance constraint is transformed into an expectation of an indicator function which can be incorporated into the cost function by considering a dual formulation. We then express the dual function in terms of the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation parameterized by the dual variable. Under a certain assumption on the system dynamics and cost function, it is shown that a strong duality holds between the primal chance-constrained problem and its dual. The Path integral approach is utilized to numerically solve the dual problem via gradient ascent using open-loop samples of system trajectories. We present simulation studies on chance-constrained motion planning for spatial navigation of mobile robots and the solution of the path integral approach is compared with that of the finite difference method.

Motivation: Existing optimization methods for MTSP struggle with computational costs as the number of agents and tasks increases, especially in large-scale scenarios.

Method: The method reformulates MTSP as a spatially constrained classification problem using a K-means-inspired framework, which enables fast path cost estimation and efficient task grouping.

Result: The proposed framework maintains high solution quality, even in large-scale scenarios with 1000 agents and 5000 targets.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient and reliable solution for large-scale multi-agent task allocation using a 'cluster-then-route' strategy.

Abstract: The Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) is a commonly used mathematical model for multi-agent task allocation. However, as the number of agents and task targets increases, existing optimization-based methods often incur prohibitive computational costs, posing significant challenges to large-scale coordination in unmanned systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a K-means-inspired task allocation framework that reformulates the MTSP as a spatially constrained classification process. By leveraging spatial coherence, the proposed method enables fast estimation of path costs and efficient task grouping, thereby fundamentally reducing overall computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the framework can maintain high solution quality even in extremely large-scale scenarios-for instance, in tasks involving 1000 agents and 5000 targets. The findings indicate that this "cluster-then-route" decomposition strategy offers an efficient and reliable solution for large-scale multi-agent task allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Newton-Raphson method is highly effective for solving power flow equations but performs poorly under challenging scenarios such as poor initialization, extreme operating conditions, or high renewable penetration.

Method: The authors introduce reinforcement learning for optimizing the NR initialization process and integrate a novel quantum-enhanced environment update. They reformulate the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and use quantum/digital annealers to evaluate state transitions more efficiently.

Result: The proposed method enhances NR convergence speed, reduces iteration counts, and increases robustness across different operating conditions.

Conclusion: By integrating reinforcement learning with quantum-enhanced optimization mechanisms, the paper provides a more efficient and robust solution for initializing the NR method in power flow problems.

Abstract: The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is widely used for solving power flow (PF) equations due to its quadratic convergence. However, its performance deteriorates under poor initialization or extreme operating scenarios, e.g., high levels of renewable energy penetration. Traditional NR initialization strategies often fail to address these challenges, resulting in slow convergence or even divergence. We propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the initialization of NR, and introduce a novel quantum-enhanced RL environment update mechanism to mitigate the significant computational cost of evaluating power system states over a combinatorially large action space at each RL timestep by formulating the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Specifically, quantum/digital annealers are integrated into the RL environment update to evaluate state transitions using a problem Hamiltonian designed for PF. Results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed, a reduction in NR iteration counts, and enhanced robustness under different operating conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding key genes in biological processes like development and disease progression requires dynamic insights beyond static gene regulatory networks.

Method: TNDE uses a shared graph attention encoder with partial optimal transport for time-varying driver gene estimation from single-cell snapshot data.

Result: TNDE performs better than baseline methods in simulations and identifies stage-specific driver genes with biological validation in mouse erythropoiesis data.

Conclusion: TNDE is an effective tool for uncovering dynamic regulation in complex biological systems.

Abstract: Identifying key driver genes governing biological processes such as development and disease progression remains a challenge. While existing methods can reconstruct cellular trajectories or infer static gene regulatory networks (GRNs), they often fail to quantify time-resolved regulatory effects within specific temporal windows. Here, we present Time-varying Network Driver Estimation (TNDE), a computational framework quantifying dynamic gene driver effects from single-cell snapshot data under a linear Markov assumption. TNDE leverages a shared graph attention encoder to preserve the local topological structure of the data. Furthermore, by incorporating partial optimal transport, TNDE accounts for unmatched cells arising from proliferation or apoptosis, thereby enabling trajectory alignment in non-equilibrium processes. Benchmarking on simulated datasets demonstrates that TNDE outperforms existing baseline methods across diverse complex regulatory scenarios. Applied to mouse erythropoiesis data, TNDE identifies stage-specific driver genes, the functional relevance of which is corroborated by biological validation. TNDE offers an effective quantitative tool for dissecting dynamic regulatory mechanisms underlying complex biological processes.

Method: The approach uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance CDSR through a transferable item augmenter to reduce noise, a dual-phase training strategy to support domain-specific and domain-shared learning, and a domain-aware profiling module for adaptive and comprehensive user profiling.

Result: Experimental validations on three public datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed LLM-EDT method, showing improvement in addressing the key challenges in CDSR.

Conclusion: LLM-EDT effectively resolves major issues in CDSR, such as domain imbalance and cross-domain preference transitions, by leveraging LLMs and innovative training mechanisms. The method achieves improved recommendation performance across domains and is supported by reproducible code provided.

Abstract: Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) has been proposed to enrich user-item interactions by incorporating information from various domains. Despite current progress, the imbalance issue and transition issue hinder further development of CDSR. The former one presents a phenomenon that the interactions in one domain dominate the entire behavior, leading to difficulty in capturing the domain-specific features in the other domain. The latter points to the difficulty in capturing users' cross-domain preferences within the mixed interaction sequence, resulting in poor next-item prediction performance for specific domains. With world knowledge and powerful reasoning ability, Large Language Models (LLMs) partially alleviate the above issues by performing as a generator and an encoder. However, current LLMs-enhanced CDSR methods are still under exploration, which fail to recognize the irrelevant noise and rough profiling problems. Thus, to make peace with the aforementioned challenges, we proposed an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation with Dual-phase Training ({LLM-EDT}). To address the imbalance issue while introducing less irrelevant noise, we first propose the transferable item augmenter to adaptively generate possible cross-domain behaviors for users. Then, to alleviate the transition issue, we introduce a dual-phase training strategy to empower the domain-specific thread with a domain-shared background. As for the rough profiling problem, we devise a domain-aware profiling module to summarize the user's preference in each domain and adaptively aggregate them to generate comprehensive user profiles. The experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-EDT. To ease reproducibility, we have released the detailed code online at {https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-EDT-583F}.
