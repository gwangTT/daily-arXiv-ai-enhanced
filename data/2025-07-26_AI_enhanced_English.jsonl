This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks.

Accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on\n  Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC) 2025", "summary": "Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the\ncharacteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model\nrequires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often\ndifficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO\nprecoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter\nwhile dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy\nconsumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model\nsignificantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean\nsquared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation\nin data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds\ntraining samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine\nsimilarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work\nenables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing\nchallenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability\nto dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher\nlevel resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over\nenergy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "A transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding achieves low-energy consumption and adapts dynamically to per-user requirements.
