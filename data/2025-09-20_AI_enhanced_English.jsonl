This paper\npresents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM\nagents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection\nattacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct\narchitectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical\ncoordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt\ninjection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances\nacross two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant\nsecurity improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success\nRates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent\npipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested\nscenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack\ncategories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data\nexfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system\nfunctionality for legitimate queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a multi-agent framework to counter prompt injection attacks on large language models, achieving 100% threat mitigation in tests.", "motivation": "Address vulnerabilities in LLMs caused by prompt injection attacks that bypass system prompts and alter behaviors.", "method": "Utilizes specialized LLM agents in sequential or hierarchical pipelines to detect and neutralize attacks in real-time.", "result": "Achieved 100% mitigation of prompt injection attacks across 400 instances on ChatGLM and Llama2 platforms.", "conclusion": "The framework effectively thwarts various categories of attacks, safeguarding system functionality while enabling legitimate use."}}
