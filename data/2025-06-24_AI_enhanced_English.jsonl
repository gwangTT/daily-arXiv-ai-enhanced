Ground based tracking requires setting up\ninfrastructure, could be range limited, and may not be feasible in remote\nareas, crowded cities or in dense vegetation areas. Vision based active\ntracking of aerial objects from another airborne vehicle, e.g., a chaser\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), promises to fill this important gap, along with\nserving aerial coordination use cases. Vision-based active tracking by a UAV\nentails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate\n(target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver\ndecisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future\ntime-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection. As a solution to\nthe first problem, this paper presents a novel integration of standard deep\nlearning based architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to\nachieve compute-efficient object detection without compromising accuracy,\nunlike standalone learning or filtering approaches. The proposed perception\nframework is validated using a lab-scale setup. For the second problem, to\nobviate the linearity assumptions and background variations limiting\neffectiveness of the traditional controllers, we present the use of\nreinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for fast computation of\nvelocity maneuvers. New state space, action space and reward formulations are\ndeveloped for this purpose, and training is performed in simulation using\nAirSim. The trained model is also tested in AirSim with respect to complex\ntarget maneuvers, and is found to outperform a baseline PID control in terms of\ntracking up-time and average distance maintained (from the target) during\ntracking.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a vision-based tracking system for UAVs, integrating deep learning and kernelized correlation filters for object detection and using reinforcement learning for maneuver decisions.", "motivation": "Vision-based active tracking from airborne UAVs addresses the limitations of ground-based tracking, offering solutions for remote areas, crowded cities, and dense vegetation applications.", "method": "The method integrates deep learning architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filters for efficient object detection and employs reinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for optimizing UAV maneuvers.", "result": "The framework is validated through lab experiments and AirSim simulations, showing better performance compared to PID controllers in maintaining tracking up-time and positioning accuracy.", "conclusion": "Integrating learning-based perception with reinforcement learning enhances UAV tracking of aerial objects, providing improved maneuverability and detection efficiency."}}

Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results.
