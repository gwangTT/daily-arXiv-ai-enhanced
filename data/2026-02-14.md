### [1] [Explaining AI Without Code: A User Study on Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11159)
*Natalia Abarca,Andrés Carvallo,Claudia López Moncada,Felipe Bravo-Marquez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a human-centered Explainable AI module integrated into DashAI (a no-code ML platform) using techniques like PDP, PFI, and KernelSHAP, showcasing improved task success and trust, especially for novices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accessible explainable AI methods in no-code ML platforms aiming to democratize AI for novices and experts alike.

Method: The module integrates three complementary explainability techniques (PDP, PFI, KernelSHAP) into DashAI's workflow and conducts a user study (N=20, novices and experts) to evaluate its impact.

Result: The module achieved high task success across explainability tasks and showed improved trust and perceived predictability among novices, though experts critiqued completeness and sufficiency.

Conclusion: The study confirms the usability of XAI for novices in no-code ML platforms while identifying challenges in balancing accessibility for novices and depth for experts.

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

### [2] [Latent Generative Solvers for Generalizable Long-Term Physics Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11229)
*Zituo Chen,Haixu Wu,Sili Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a framework to improve long-horizon predictions across diverse PDE systems while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of surrogate simulation for heterogeneous PDE systems, focusing on long-term stability and scalability of predictions.

Method: A two-stage framework combining a pretrained VAE for latent space mapping and a Transformer for latent dynamics using flow matching. Key mechanisms include uncertainty perturbation to stabilize predictions and flow forcing for system descriptor alignment.

Result: LGS reduces rollout drift on long horizons compared to neural-operator baselines, achieving up to 70x lower FLOPs, scalable pretraining, and efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution datasets with minimal finetuning.

Conclusion: LGS offers a scalable and generalizable method for uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers, improving reliability for long-term scientific applications.

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

### [3] [On Decision-Valued Maps and Representational Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11295)
*Gil Raitses*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DecisionDB, a system that formalizes decision-valued maps and enables deterministic replay of decisions through stored artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue where computational outcomes vary based on data representation, requiring a system to log, audit, and ensure decision reproducibility across representations.

Method: The paper describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that identifies, stores, and replays decisions using detailed logging and write-once artifact storage for deterministic decision recovery.

Result: DecisionDB partitions representation space into regions and boundaries, enabling mechanically checkable conditions for decision reuse and ensuring reproducibility across different representations.

Conclusion: Formalizing decision-valued maps and implementing DecisionDB provides a robust solution for auditing, replaying, and ensuring consistent computational outcomes across different data representations.

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Voxtral Realtime, a real-time automatic speech recognition model with offline-level accuracy and sub-second latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the need for real-time automatic speech recognition models that maintain high transcription quality without relying on offline or semi-adaptive methods.

Method: They propose an end-to-end trained streaming model based on the Delayed Streams Modeling framework, enhanced with a new causal audio encoder and Ada RMS-Norm.

Result: At a 480ms delay, Voxtral Realtime achieves parity with the transcription quality of Whispers' offline system, while supporting streaming transcription for 13 languages.

Conclusion: Voxtral Realtime sets a benchmark for real-time transcription models, providing state-of-the-art results and open access to the model weights under an Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: We introduce Voxtral Realtime, a natively streaming automatic speech recognition model that matches offline transcription quality at sub-second latency. Unlike approaches that adapt offline models through chunking or sliding windows, Voxtral Realtime is trained end-to-end for streaming, with explicit alignment between audio and text streams. Our architecture builds on the Delayed Streams Modeling framework, introducing a new causal audio encoder and Ada RMS-Norm for improved delay conditioning. We scale pretraining to a large-scale dataset spanning 13 languages. At a delay of 480ms, Voxtral Realtime achieves performance on par with Whisper, the most widely deployed offline transcription system. We release the model weights under the Apache 2.0 license.

### [5] [The PBSAI Governance Ecosystem: A Multi-Agent AI Reference Architecture for Securing Enterprise AI Estates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11301)
*John M. Willis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PBSAI, a reference architecture for securing AI estates, aligning with NIST standards and proposing a framework for organizations to govern their AI systems effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current governance and security frameworks lack detailed, implementable architectures to manage the complexities of large-scale, multi-agent AI systems in enterprise and hyperscale environments.

Method: The authors propose PBSAI, a reference architecture that organizes responsibilities into a taxonomy of twelve domains and employs bounded agent families with context envelopes and output contracts to mediate between tools and policy.

Result: PBSAI clarifies security practices through a lightweight formal model, ensuring traceability, provenance, and human-in-the-loop guarantees in AI-enabled environments, and demonstrates alignment with NIST AI RMF functions.

Conclusion: PBSAI provides a structured, scalable framework for governance and security in AI ecosystems, enabling improved management and defense in both enterprise and hyperscale environments, while supporting future empirical validation.

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

### [6] [Dissecting Subjectivity and the "Ground Truth" Illusion in Data Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11318)
*Sheza Munir,Benjamin Mah,Krisha Kalsi,Shivani Kapania,Julian Posada,Edith Law,Ding Wang,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ground truth labels in machine learning have systemic flaws, primarily ignoring valuable human disagreement, and can lead to biased and culturally incompetent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the misuse of "ground truth" in machine learning, treating human disagreement as noise rather than a sociotechnical signal, undermining cultural pluralism and model fairness.

Method: Conducted a systematic review of 2020-2025 literature across seven venues, filtered through thematic analysis, ultimately synthesizing findings from 346 papers.

Result: The study identified systemic issues, like anchoring bias from model-mediated annotations and geographic biases enforcing Western norms, which suppress human input and lead to cultural misdiagnoses.

Conclusion: The paper stresses reclaiming human disagreement as a valuable signal and proposes pluralistic annotation infrastructures to prioritize diversity over singular correctness in machine learning models.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

### [7] [Bi-Level Prompt Optimization for Multimodal LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11340)
*Bo Pan,Xuan Kan,Kaitai Zhang,Yan Yan,Shunwen Tan,Zihao He,Zixin Ding,Junjie Wu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bi-level prompt optimization (BLPO) framework to improve multimodal large language models (LLMs) as judges for AI-generated image evaluations, addressing limitations like context constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments, especially in a multimodal setting, remains challenging due to cost and inflexible methods like supervised fine-tuning. Efficient alternatives are needed.

Method: The proposed framework, BLPO, refines prompts in two levels: (1) converting images to textual representations for better context usage and (2) joint optimization of judge and image-to-text prompts to enhance multimodal evaluations.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets and LLM judges demonstrate improved evaluation effectiveness and alignment with human judgments under limited context constraints.

Conclusion: BLPO provides an efficient and effective solution for optimizing multimodal evaluations in LLMs, helping overcome limitations in existing approaches and improving alignment with human assessments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

### [8] [AgentNoiseBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Tool-Using LLM Agents Under Noisy Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11348)
*Ruipeng Wang,Yuxin Chen,Yukai Wang,Chang Wu,Junfeng Fang,Xiaodong Cai,Qi Gu,Hui Su,An Zhang,Xiang Wang,Xunliang Cai,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AgentNoiseBench, a tool for testing the robustness of language model agents in noisy, real-world-like environments, identifying performance drops due to environmental noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between the strong performance of language model-based agents on benchmarks and their inconsistent performance in real-world environments due to noise and stochasticity.

Method: Analyzed real-world noise types, categorized environmental noise into user-noise and tool-noise, and developed a pipeline to inject controlled noise into agent-centric benchmarks to study model robustness.

Result: Results demonstrated consistent performance variability across a range of models under different noisy conditions, emphasizing their sensitivity to environmental disturbances.

Conclusion: Current agentic models need further improvement in robustness to handle the stochasticity and noise in real-world deployments effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

### [9] [Pushing Forward Pareto Frontiers of Proactive Agents with Behavioral Agentic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11351)
*Yihang Yao,Zhepeng Cen,Haohong Lin,Shiqi Liu,Zuxin Liu,Jiacheng Zhu,Zhang-Wei Hong,Laixi Shi,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BAO, an agentic RL framework focusing on proactive reasoning and interaction alignment to train user-friendly large language model agents for multi-turn tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve efficiency and user engagement in proactive LLM agents, addressing the trade-off between task performance and overuse of feedback.

Method: A novel RL framework, BAO, blends behavior enhancement and regularization to enable efficient and user-aligned interactions in multi-turn task settings.

Result: BAO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL baselines and commercial LLM agents across the UserRL benchmark suite.

Conclusion: BAO is a promising approach for creating proactive LLM agents tailored for complex real-world applications requiring multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

### [10] [ReplicatorBench: Benchmarking LLM Agents for Replicability in Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11354)
*Bang Nguyen,Dominik Soós,Qian Ma,Rochana R. Obadage,Zack Ranjan,Sai Koneru,Timothy M. Errington,Shakhlo Nematova,Sarah Rajtmajer,Jian Wu,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReplicatorBench, a novel framework to evaluate AI agents' abilities in replicating research across three stages: data retrieval, experimental execution, and result interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in existing benchmarks that focus on reproducible research only, neglecting the lack of data availability, diversity, and evaluation of the entire replication process.

Method: ReplicatorBench includes human-verified research claims in social and behavioral sciences, dividing replication tasks into three stages. The authors also developed ReplicatorAgent, a framework with tools for benchmarking AI using various LLMs.

Result: Findings reveal that while AI agents can design and execute experiments well, they face challenges in retrieving new data or resources needed to replicate claims.

Conclusion: ReplicatorBench advances the evaluation of AI in research replication. Current AI models show promise but have limitations in resource retrieval, requiring further enhancement.

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

### [11] [Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11389)
*Heejeong Nam,Quentin Le Lidec,Lucas Maes,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: C-JEPA is an object-centric model for relational understanding and interaction reasoning, leading to improved performance in visual question answering and agent control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models struggle with relational understanding in interaction-dependent dynamics. Object-centric approaches are insufficient without addressing masking issues for robust reasoning.

Method: C-JEPA applies masked joint embedding prediction to object-centric representations, utilizes object-level masking to enforce relational reasoning, and prevents shortcuts akin to counterfactual reasoning.

Result: C-JEPA improves counterfactual reasoning by 20% and achieves efficient agent control using only 1% of the latent features required by patch-based models.

Conclusion: C-JEPA significantly advances causal and relational reasoning, offering gains in several tasks while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions. Our code is available at https://github.com/galilai-group/cjepa.

*Michael Menezes,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GHOST, a structured pruning framework addressing inference overhead in Mamba2 models by approximating balanced truncation via forward-pass statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in Mamba2's temporal modeling due to substantial inference overhead caused by expanded state dimension.

Method: GHOST utilizes forward-pass statistics to approximate control-theoretic balanced truncation, combining controllability and observability for structured pruning.

Result: GHOST reduces state dimensions by 50% on models with 130M to 2.7B parameters, incurring approximately a 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

Conclusion: GHOST offers a practical and efficient solution for structured pruning that retains high fidelity without the costs associated with gradient-based methods.

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/mamba2_ghost-7BCB/.

*Sina Tayebati,Divake Kumar,Nastaran Darabi,Davide Ettori,Ranganath Krishnan,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACER is an advanced trajectory-level uncertainty metric designed for tool-using AI agents interacting with humans, focusing on detecting critical failures early.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uncertainty proxies struggle with detecting trajectory-level failures, particularly in complex multi-turn interactions, where sparse yet critical issues occur.

Method: TRACER combines multiple signals, including content-aware surprisal, situational awareness, semantic repetition, and coherence gaps, and uses a tail-focused risk functional to highlight anomalies.

Result: TRACER significantly improves task failure prediction by enhancing AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55%, offering earlier and better detection of uncertainty.

Conclusion: The TRACER metric is effective for improving reliability and risk assessment in complex tool-use conversational AI settings, with code and benchmarks readily available for wider use.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

### [14] [Distributionally Robust Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Robust Value Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11437)
*Chengrui Qu,Christopher Yeh,Kishan Panaganti,Eric Mazumdar,Adam Wierman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM) to improve cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning in environments with uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unreliability of centralized training with decentralized execution in MARL due to environmental uncertainties.

Method: Introduce DrIGM principle and derive robust variants of value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) to improve scalability and integration, relying on robust Q-targets.

Result: Empirical results show that the methods improve out-of-distribution performance across SustainGym and StarCraft simulators.

Conclusion: DrIGM enhances robustness in MARL by aligning decentralized actions with robust team-optimal joint actions, presenting scalable, effective, and practical solutions tested on simulators.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

*Zhengbo Jiao,Shaobo Wang,Zifan Zhang,Wei Wang,Bing Zhao,Hu Wei,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), proposing Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), which improves performance by focusing on visually grounded, high-connectivity tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve how visual evidence is integrated and utilized in reasoning by MLLMs during RLVR.

Method: The authors analyze cross-modal attention connectivity to identify high-connectivity tokens that serve as visual-textual anchors and propose AT-RL, a graph-based clustering approach to reinforce these tokens.

Result: AT-RL requires only 1.2% overhead and enables significant performance improvements, allowing a 32B model to outperform larger baselines like the 72B-Instruct model across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that reasoning quality in multimodal RL depends on effective credit assignment to visually grounded anchor tokens rather than the quantity of tokens involved. This insight drives enhanced model performance with minimal resource expenditure.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

### [16] [AgentLeak: A Full-Stack Benchmark for Privacy Leakage in Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11510)
*Faouzi El Yagoubi,Ranwa Al Mallah,Godwin Badu-Marfo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentLeak introduces a benchmark for evaluating privacy risks in multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems, highlighting vulnerabilities in inter-agent communication and internal channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for privacy risks in multi-agent LLM systems are insufficient as they only evaluate external outputs and not internal communications or processes.

Method: AgentLeak is a full-stack benchmark examining privacy leakage across 1,000 scenarios and internal channels, paired with an attack taxonomy and detection pipeline. Testing was done across multiple LLM systems and configurations.

Result: Multi-agent systems decrease external channel leakage but introduce internal channel vulnerabilities, increasing system exposure. Inter-agent communication is a major vulnerability, with sensitive information leakage rates higher than external outputs. Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved the lowest leakage rates.

Conclusion: Internal-channel privacy protections, particularly for inter-agent communication, are critical to enhancing the overall security of multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a human-inspired continuous learning framework that focuses on improving AI systems' internal reasoning, action, and reflection mechanisms for better performance in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the limitations of existing AI systems, which primarily focus on task-specific outputs or static knowledge while neglecting the refinement of internal reasoning processes, learning policies, and continuous adaptation.

Method: A framework is proposed that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification into a dynamic learning system. It leverages parallel learning, maintains structured records of reasoning trajectories, and introduces hierarchical learning mechanisms to optimize both task and learning strategies.

Result: The framework was tested on a temperature sensor anomaly detection task, showing a 23.9% reduction in average runtime, demonstrating its efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: Incorporating internal-process learning allows AI systems to evolve their cognitive architecture and improve operational stability while continuously learning and adapting to new conditions.

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

TL;DR: CausalAgent is a system that automates causal inference through natural language interaction and visualizations, addressing challenges in traditional causal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce technical barriers in causal inference workflows and provide an intuitive, user-centered paradigm using AI.

Method: The paper uses Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to automate the causal analysis workflow.

Result: CausalAgent simplifies the process of thorough causal analysis, requiring minimal technical knowledge from users and enabling rigorous and interpretable results through intuitive inputs.

Conclusion: CausalAgent revolutionizes human-AI collaboration for causal inference, lowering barriers and maintaining analytical integrity with user-friendly and automated systems.

Abstract: Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.

*Hanbing Liu,Chunhao Tian,Nan An,Ziyuan Wang,Pinyan Lu,Changyuan Yu,Qi Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces INTENT, a hierarchical planning framework that improves budget-constrained tool use by language models during task solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of enabling language models to solve multi-step tasks using costly external tools under strict budget constraints.

Method: They propose INTENT, which uses an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate tool usage, manage cost, and guide decision-making during task execution.

Result: The proposed framework strictly adheres to budget constraints while improving task success rates and maintains robustness against dynamic changes like tool price variability.

Conclusion: INTENT proves effective in addressing budget-constrained decision-making, offering a structured approach to managing costs and improving task outcomes for tool-augmented agents.

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

*Zhenlin Qin,Yancheng Ling,Leizhen Wang,Francisco Câmara Pereira,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemaPop, a model for population synthesis that combines semantic understanding using large language models and statistical modeling to improve realism, diversity, and alignment with target population distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population synthesis methods struggle to incorporate latent behavioral patterns and semantic understanding from survey data, which are crucial for accurate individual-level socio-economic simulations.

Method: SemaPop integrates large language models for extracting semantic persona representations from survey data with a generative population modeling framework based on a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP). Marginal regularization ensures alignment with statistical constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SemaPop-GAN performs better in aligning marginal and joint distributions while maintaining diversity and sample-level feasibility. Semantic persona conditioning and architectural choices notably enhance structural realism.

Conclusion: SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis by effectively fusing semantic and statistical information. It sets a foundation for future generative systems incorporating behavioral semantics with statistical constraints.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

*Aditya Taparia,Som Sagar,Ransalu Senanayake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARC, a system using reinforcement learning for adaptive query-specific agent configuration, improving task accuracy while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of static or manually-tuned configurations in LLM-based agent systems, which lead to inefficiencies and brittle performance.

Method: The paper formulates agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem, utilizing a hierarchical policy learned through reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust configurations.

Result: ARC achieves up to 25% higher task accuracy and reduces token and runtime costs across various benchmarks compared to hand-designed baselines.

Conclusion: Learning dynamic and query-specific agent configurations is an effective alternative to static designs, improving both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

TL;DR: This survey examines multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) in sequential decision-making systems, using the Five Ws framework to connect different research approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective communication approaches enabling collaboration in dynamic, partially observable multi-agent environments.

Method: Organized research into three paradigms: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Emergent Language, and Large Language Models, analyzing their evolution, trade-offs, and design implications.

Result: Highlights the strengths, limitations, and design patterns of each paradigm while identifying open challenges for scalable and interpretable collaborative systems.

Conclusion: Future systems should integrate learning, language, and control methods to advance scalable multi-agent communication and collaboration.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: MAPLE provides an optimized strategy for multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) models, addressing challenges in modality-blind training by introducing modality-aware benchmarks and training frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges with multimodal RL training where treating all input modalities equally causes inefficiencies, slow convergence, and lack of robustness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Introduces MAPLE, including MAPLE-bench for modality requirements annotation, MAPO for modality-aware optimization, and adaptive weighting/curriculum scheduling for improved signal combination handling.

Result: MAPLE reduces uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, accelerates convergence by 3.18x, and improves stability across modality combinations in scenarios with limited signal access.

Conclusion: MAPLE is a comprehensive multimodal RL post-training ecosystem that optimizes performance, robustness, and training efficiency for deployment-ready applications.

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable single-cell RNA-seq data analysis that is interpretable, auditable, and diagnostically informative by integrating large language models for omics-native reasoning.

Method: Developed scPilot, a structured framework that allows LLMs to perform systematic reasoning on omics data step-by-step. Released scBench for benchmarking performance using curated datasets and graders.

Result: scPilot improved cell-type annotation accuracy by 11% and reduced trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% using iterative reasoning compared to traditional one-shot methods.

Conclusion: scPilot advances single-cell analysis by making LLMs capable of providing transparent and evidence-based insights into omics data. The framework is publicly available for use.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

*Aman Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Running the same LLM agent twice on the same task often leads to different behaviors, which can affect task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if the same LLM agent gives consistent outputs for identical tasks and understand its impact on task performance.

Method: A study of 3,000 agent runs using three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) on the HotpotQA dataset to track behavioral consistency and analyze divergences.

Result: Agents produce 2.0–4.2 unique action sequences per 10 runs on average. Inconsistent tasks show significantly lower accuracy (25–60%) compared to consistent ones (80–92%). Early decision divergence is identified as the root.

Conclusion: Behavioral consistency affects accuracy, and monitoring it during execution can improve reliability by enabling early error detection.

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NMIPS, a framework for solving families of PDEs leveraging multitasking symbolic learning for analytical solutions, improving both accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of traditional numerical methods and machine learning solvers, which are computationally expensive or lack interpretability, by developing a solution that combines efficiency and analytical insight.

Method: The NMIPS framework uses multifactorial optimization for simultaneous PDE solving and utilizes an affine transfer method to share learned mathematical structures across PDEs in a family, enhancing efficiency.

Result: NMIPS provides up to a ~35.7% accuracy improvement in solving PDE families compared to baselines, while offering interpretable analytical solutions.

Conclusion: NMIPS effectively addresses both computational inefficiency and the lack of interpretability in existing PDE solving methods, presenting an innovative multitasking approach.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the fundamental weakness of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs, bridging the significant performance gap compared to human capabilities.

Method: MathSpatial framework includes three components: MathSpatial-Bench (benchmark), MathSpatial-Corpus (training dataset), and MathSpatial-SRT (structured reasoning model).

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy and reduces token usage by 25%.

Conclusion: MathSpatial enables precise evaluation and improvement of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs while disentangling reasoning elements from perception.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: This paper identifies limitations in applying traditional reinforcement learning paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering and proposes a novel medical alignment paradigm to address correctness, safety, and compliance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning methods for language models lack the efficiency and accuracy required for medical question answering, as they struggle with verifiable correctness, cost-efficiency, and multi-objective optimization specific to medical contexts.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that organizes alignment objectives into four categories, combining observable metrics with optimizable targets. Additionally, a unified optimization mechanism using Reference-Frozen Normalization and Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting is proposed to stabilize and improve collaborative optimization.

Result: Experimental results validate the new paradigm's success in improving alignment in real-world medical scenarios, including achieving balanced optimization among diverse objectives.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm redefines alignment methods for vertical domains, demonstrating its capability to address the unique requirements of medical question answering through fine-grained supervision and advanced optimization strategies.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores cross-architecture model diffing using a novel method, revealing significant behavioral differences in AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model diffing has been limited to comparing a base model with its finetuned variants. Expanding this to cross-architecture models is needed to uncover safety-critical traits in diverse AI systems.

Method: The authors utilize crosscoders for cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs) to isolate unique features of models.

Result: Unsupervised analysis revealed behavioral traits such as political alignment, exceptionalism, and copyright refusal mechanisms in various AI models.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing is demonstrated as an effective approach to identifying behavioral differences in diverse AI architectures.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

*E Fan,Lisong Shi,Zhengtong Li,Chih-yung Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neurosymbolic framework, PhyNiKCE, to address challenges in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for physics-based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, significantly improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of LLMs' inability to enforce strict physical conservation laws and numerical stability in CFD simulations, addressing the semantic-physical disconnect caused by purely semantic approaches.

Method: PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation by introducing a symbolic knowledge engine that enforces physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine, using specialized retrieval strategies for valid CFD configurations.

Result: PhyNiKCE achieved a 96% improvement over current baselines in CFD tasks, reduced self-correction loops by 59%, and decreased LLM token consumption by 17% through knowledge-driven initialization.

Conclusion: Decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement enhances trustworthiness, robustness, and efficiency in CFD applications, and the scalable architecture can extend to other industrial automation tasks.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

*Longyuan Zhu,Hairan Hua,Linlin Miao,Bing Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies issues with current benchmark reliability for LLMs and introduces the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a tool to audit benchmarks' effectiveness and longevity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unreliability of current benchmarks for evaluating large language models due to score inflation, selective reporting, and eroding trust in evaluation results.

Method: The authors propose BHI, a data-driven framework that audits benchmarks along three axes: Capability Discrimination, Anti-Saturation, and Impact, analyzing benchmarks systematically based on models' evaluations.

Result: The study systematically characterizes 106 benchmarks from 91 models, demonstrating BHI as a framework to quantify benchmark health and providing insights into evaluation practices.

Conclusion: BHI is established as the first macro-level framework for evaluating and managing benchmarks, enhancing their reliability and guiding their lifecycle management for future models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

### [32] [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11675)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Machine learning systems often succeed through flawed reasoning that breaks under new conditions. This work investigates these failures, formalizes them causally, and proposes a novel method for learning correct causal reasoning, showing improved outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issue of machine learning systems succeeding for the wrong reasons despite high performance, leading to failures under distributional shifts, necessitates a method to enforce correct causal reasoning rather than just task-specific success.

Method: The paper introduces Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), which penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of performance. It is embedded within a layered architecture that incorporates three contributions: a theorem linking actions and causal operations, a causal belief revision operator, and a taxonomy to guard against errors across domains.

Result: The method is tested on 1,360 scenarios, showcasing that advanced models resist generic corrections but ERM feedback corrects 53-59% of entrenched errors effectively, overcoming failures where traditional feedback methods fail.

Conclusion: Causal reasoning failures in machine learning models can be addressed through theoretical and structural interventions like ERM, enabling robust and transferable solutions to distributional shifts and entrenched errors.

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

*Yihao Liu,Ziyun Zhang,Zile He,Huaqian Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of translating large language models' reasoning and tool use into accurate structured workflows, proposing a decoupled framework for task execution and workflow construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle to transform reasoning and tool use into reliable and accurate structured workflows due to interference between solving tasks and workflow creation.

Method: The paper introduces an Execute-Summarize (ES) framework where the model first solves tasks using tools and then independently reconstructs workflows from execution traces.

Result: Experiments on FlowBench demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in workflow accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Decoupling task execution and workflow construction enhances the ability to ground LLM reasoning into structured workflows, offering a potential paradigm for reliable workflow design.

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

*Chengwei Ma,Zhen Tian,Zhou Zhou,Zhixian Xu,Xiaowei Zhu,Xia Hua,Si Shi,F. Richard Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline to address structural blindness in multimodal large language models for visual understanding, significantly improving performance in engineering applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inability of current MLLMs to capture topology and logical relationships in engineering schematics since these models rely on pixel-driven paradigms, which discard explicit structural dependencies.

Method: The proposed method, Vector-to-Graph (V2G), transforms CAD diagrams into property graphs, where nodes signify components and edges denote connectivity, explicitly defining structural dependencies for computational reasoning.

Result: Using a diagnostic benchmark for electrical compliance checks, V2G demonstrated substantial accuracy improvements across all error categories, whereas leading pixel-focused MLLMs performed near chance levels.

Conclusion: The research underscores the inadequacy of pixel-based methods for engineering analytics and shows that structure-aware representations like V2G enable reliable and practical applications of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains. To facilitate further research, we release our benchmark and implementation at https://github.com/gm-embodied/V2G-Audit.

*Xin Xu,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Haoliang Wang,Julian McAuley,Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter, a confidence-aware routing mechanism, optimizes reasoning efficiency and accuracy by dynamically switching between latent and explicit reasoning pathways, showing significant improvements on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning efficiency and accuracy by resolving the challenges in latent reasoning, such as noise propagation and unreliable confidence dynamics.

Method: ThinkRouter evaluates model confidence during inference and adaptively routes reasoning to either a latent or discrete token space, based on confidence levels.

Result: ThinkRouter achieved a 19.70-point improvement in Pass@1 accuracy and reduced reasoning generation length by 15.55% across STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed ThinkRouter mechanism is effective in improving both reasoning accuracy and efficiency by dynamically addressing low-confidence reasoning steps and confidence-related errors.

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

*Weihong Lin,Lin Sun,Qilong Shi,Aomufei Yuan,Yuxuan Tian,Zhengyang Wang,Guangxiang Zhao,Xiangzheng Zhang,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a model merging framework that enhances generalization and generation stability by selectively controlling functional interference in merged models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods often result in degraded generalization and unstable behaviors due to reliance on parameter-space heuristics. There is a need for a better approach to integrate model capabilities without costly retraining.

Method: SCF-RKL uses sparse, distribution-aware updates and measures functional divergence with reverse KL divergence. It selectively incorporates complementary parameters to ensure stable representations and integrate new capabilities.

Result: SCF-RKL consistently outperformed existing model merging methods across various benchmarks, showcasing improved reasoning, instruction-following, knowledge integration, safety, and vision classification.

Conclusion: SCF-RKL offers a robust solution for merging models effectively while maintaining stability, strong generalization, and improved performance in diverse tasks, making it a superior alternative to prior approaches.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Text2GQL-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Graph-Query-Language systems, addressing limitations in domain coverage, query languages, and evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to advance Text-to-GQL systems by solving challenges such as limited benchmark datasets and evaluation methods, hindering systematic comparison of models across graph query languages and domains.

Method: The authors developed Text2GQL-Bench, a benchmark with 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs over 13 domains, coupled with a scalable construction framework and evaluation criteria measuring grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy.

Result: Evaluation reveals poor zero-shot performance by LLMs, with execution accuracy under 4% and grammatical validity lower than 70%. Fine-tuned models significantly improve these metrics, achieving up to 45.1% execution accuracy and 90.8% grammatical validity.

Conclusion: Exposure to sufficient examples substantially improves model performance in generating accurate and valid queries, highlighting the importance of high-quality datasets for advancing Text-to-GQL systems.

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

*Zibo Xiao,Jun Sun,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems, which robustly detects, manages, and prevents incidents autonomously with high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents are widely deployed but existing safety mechanisms lack robust incident response capabilities, motivating the need for an autonomous framework to handle incidents.

Method: AIR provides a domain-specific language incorporated into the agent's loop for detecting, containing, recovering, and preventing incidents using semantic checks and tool engagement.

Result: AIR displays over 90% success rates in incident detection, remediation, and prevention, with effective, timely operations and LLM-generated rules comparable to developer-authored ones.

Conclusion: Incident response frameworks like AIR are critical for improving LLM agent safety, showcasing feasibility, effectiveness, and the necessity of robust post-incident mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time technique for reinforcement learning that improves multi-turn task performance by generating high-quality rollouts through lightweight tree-style search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in multi-turn RL, such as sparse or delayed rewards and stochastic environments, which can lead to poor exploitation and mode collapse.

Method: The proposed TSR method employs tree-style search during training to generate high-quality trajectories, using task-specific feedback to select optimal actions at each step. This method is optimizer-agnostic and can pair with RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO.

Result: TSR achieves up to 15% performance improvement and more stable learning in tasks like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop, with only a one-time increase in training compute.

Conclusion: TSR provides a general and simple approach for stronger multi-turn agent learning that complements existing RL frameworks by moving the search process to the training stage.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MaxExp, a new method for binarizing probabilistic output of species distribution models (SDMs), alongside an efficient alternative called Set Size Expectation (SSE), both improving species assemblage predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods to convert SDM outputs into binary maps often distort species prevalence and community composition, necessitating more robust and reproducible approaches.

Method: The authors propose MaxExp, a decision-driven framework that maximizes evaluation metrics for species assemblages, and SSE, which predicts assemblages based on species richness expectations. Both methods were tested across diverse taxa and metrics.

Result: MaxExp consistently outperformed traditional methods, particularly in cases of strong class imbalance and species rarity, while SSE offered competitive performance with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MaxExp and SSE provide advanced tools for binarizing multispecies SDM outputs, enhancing ecological inference and conservation planning.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE is a reinforcement learning-based framework that enhances online advertising text generation to optimize performance metrics and ensure compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing advertising systems often lack global optimization due to the separation of text generation and metric alignment processes.

Method: RELATE uses policy learning to integrate performance objectives and compliance constraints into the text generation process, optimizing conversion metrics under multi-dimensional rewards.

Result: RELATE outperforms baseline models in large-scale experiments and achieves improved click-through conversion rates in real-world online deployments.

Conclusion: RELATE demonstrates robust effectiveness in improving ad text quality, optimizing conversion rates, and meeting policy constraints in industrial applications.

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

### [43] [Detecting RLVR Training Data via Structural Convergence of Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11792)
*Hongbo Zhang,Yue Yang,Jianhao Yan,Guangsheng Bao,Yue Zhang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Min-$k$NN Distance to detect examples seen in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) fine-tuning, highlighting its superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to evaluate and ensure fair reasoning models trained through RLVR without benchmark contamination and limitations of traditional detection methods in RLVR.

Method: They propose Min-$k$NN Distance, a black-box detector that calculates the average of the k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances across multiple completions for a prompt to identify RLVR-seen versus unseen prompts.

Result: Min-$k$NN Distance demonstrated reliable detection capabilities, outperforming existing detection baselines in experiments with multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models.

Conclusion: Min-$k$NN Distance effectively addresses RLVR benchmark contamination by identifying seen instances without requiring model reference details or token probabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

*Pingjun Pan,Tingting Zhou,Peiyao Lu,Tingting Fei,Hongxiang Chen,Chuanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-SAM addresses limitations in multi-modal recommendation systems by introducing a framework enhancing semantic tokenization and hierarchical modeling for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance multi-modal recommendations by addressing suboptimal tokenization and architecture-data mismatch issues.

Method: Introduces the Hi-SAM framework with two key designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST) for better alignment and quantization between modalities, and (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT) for improved hierarchical representation of semantic IDs.

Result: Hi-SAM produces notable improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing enhanced performance particularly in cold-start recommendation scenarios. Deployment on a social platform resulted in a 6.55% gain in the core metric.

Conclusion: The Hi-SAM framework effectively improves the processing of multi-modal data, addressing redundancy and architectural challenges, leading to better user engagement and recommendation performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

### [45] [PuYun-LDM: A Latent Diffusion Model for High-Resolution Ensemble Weather Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11807)
*Lianjun Wu,Shengchen Zhu,Yuxuan Liu,Liuyu Kai,Xiaoduan Feng,Duomin Wang,Wenshuo Liu,Jingxuan Zhang,Kelvin Li,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents PuYun-LDM, a method improving latent diffusion models for high-resolution weather forecasting by employing 3D-MAE and VA-MFM strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models underperform in high-resolution ensemble weather forecasting due to limited diffusability and inapplicable existing regularization or spectral methods for meteorological data.

Method: The authors introduce a 3D Masked AutoEncoder for weather-state features as additional conditioning and VA-MFM, which adapts thresholds based on variable spectral energy distributions, to improve diffusability and regularization.

Result: PuYun-LDM outperforms traditional ECMWF ENS in short-term forecasts, matches ENS at longer timescales, and enables a global 15-day forecast in 5 minutes using a single NVIDIA H200 GPU.

Conclusion: PuYun-LDM significantly enhances the ability of diffusion models for weather forecasting, providing an efficient alternative to current global forecast methods with high accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

*Huanyi Xie,Yubin Chen,Liangyu Wang,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in sequence length prediction for LLMs and RL sampling by proposing a lightweight framework that reuses internal model states for prediction, outperforming prior methods and improving throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting sequence lengths involve high computational overhead, poor generalization, and fail in stochastic settings, leading to inefficiencies in LLM serving and RL sampling.

Method: The paper introduces Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) for static length prediction using entropy and token activations, and Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) for step-wise length estimation in stochastic generation scenarios.

Result: The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results on the developed ForeLen benchmark, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) by 29.16% compared to the best baseline and leading to significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: The framework offers efficient and accurate sequence length prediction, establishing a new benchmark and approach for optimizing LLM inference and RL sampling processes.

Abstract: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and reinforcement learning (RL) sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DTAPP-IICR, a scalable and efficient framework for preflight planning of large UAV fleets under challenging constraints such as temporal No-Fly Zones and delivery deadlines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for a robust and scalable preflight planning approach for UAV fleets in complex, dynamic urban airspaces, where traditional methods struggle with real-world challenges.

Method: The framework prioritizes missions by urgency, calculates trajectories with a novel 4D single-agent planner (SFIPP-ST), and resolves residual conflicts using iterative Large Neighborhood Search guided by a geometric conflict graph, paired with directional pruning for efficiency.

Result: DTAPP-IICR demonstrated near-100% success on benchmarks involving up to 1,000 UAVs and achieved significant runtime reductions, outperforming existing methods in scalability and reliability.

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR offers a practical and highly scalable solution for UAV preflight planning, making it suitable for dense urban operations where other methods fail.

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

### [48] [Revis: Sparse Latent Steering to Mitigate Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11824)
*Jialin Wu,Wei Shi,Han Shen,Peigui Qi,Kunsheng Tang,Zhicong Huang,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents REVIS, a framework to reduce object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by extracting pure visual information and restoring it efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of object hallucination in LVLMs caused by the interference of visual features and textual representations in deeper network layers.

Method: Proposes REVIS, a training-free framework that uses orthogonal projection to extract pure visual information and applies sparse intervention at a specific network depth for efficient restoration.

Result: REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: REVIS is an effective and computationally efficient solution for improving visual information processing in LVLMs, addressing a critical issue without compromising overall performance.

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

*Yordan Yordanov,Matteo Forasassi,Bayar Menzat,Ruizhi Wang,Chang Qi,Markus Kaltenberger,Amine M'Charrak,Tommaso Salvatori,Thomas Lukasiewicz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introducing ProtoT, an alternative autoregressive language model with interpretability and scalability benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address opacity and risks in the reasoning of current state-of-the-art language models (LMs).

Method: Developed ProtoT, a transformer architecture based on prototypes enabling interpretable reasoning and improved scalability.

Result: ProtoT achieves robust performance on text generation, downstream tasks, and input perturbations, while being interpretable and scalable.

Conclusion: ProtoT provides a viable alternative to traditional transformers, enabling high performance and improved interpretability in language modeling.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

*Lu Tao,Jinxuan Luo,Yousuke Watanabe,Zhengshu Zhou,Yuhuan Lu,Shen Ying,Pan Zhang,Fei Zhao,Hiroaki Takada*

TL;DR: This paper introduces Talk2DM, a module for dynamic map systems in autonomous driving, enabling natural-language-supported querying and reasoning using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic mapping systems in autonomous driving lack a natural-language-supported human interface, which can enhance human interaction and provide better usability.

Method: The authors developed VRCsim, a framework for generating VRC cooperative perception data, and VRC-QA, a dataset for spatial queries. They further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module using a chain-of-prompt mechanism leveraging LLMs for natural-language interaction.

Result: Talk2DM achieved over 93% accuracy in natural language querying, with response times of 2-5 seconds, demonstrating its strong generalization and practical use.

Conclusion: Talk2DM shows practical potential to improve human-DM interactions in autonomous driving systems by integrating natural language support through advanced LLMs.

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive framework for effective task decomposition, delegation, and collaboration among AI agents and humans, with mechanisms to handle dynamic environments and failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents increasingly require the capability to decompose tasks and delegate them meaningfully to achieve more complex goals. Existing methods are insufficient due to their reliance on simple heuristics, lack of adaptability to environmental changes, and ineffectiveness in handling failures.

Method: The authors introduce a dynamic framework for task delegation, which integrates decision-making processes, role clarity, responsibility transfer, accountability, intent communication, and trust-building mechanisms in delegation networks involving both AI and humans.

Result: The framework facilitates robust collaboration in complex and adaptive systems, making it relevant for implementation in the emerging agentic web.

Conclusion: This framework enhances the effectiveness of task allocation and delegation processes between AI agents and humans, promoting reliability and adaptability in heterogeneous networks.

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

*Yifan Luo,Yang Zhan,Jiedong Jiang,Tianyang Liu,Mingrui Wu,Zhennan Zhou,Bin Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoders (HSAEs) to uncover hierarchical structures in large language models (LLMs) by learning parent-child relationships between linguistic features, showing strong performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sparse autoencoders identify features in isolation, which limits their ability to capture the hierarchical structure observed in natural languages within LLMs.

Method: The HSAE extends SAEs by introducing a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism to enforce hierarchical relationships between features. It is evaluated on various LLMs and layers with comprehensive experiments.

Result: The HSAE successfully identifies semantically meaningful feature hierarchies while maintaining reconstruction fidelity and interpretability across different dictionary sizes.

Conclusion: This work enables scalable discovery and hierarchical analysis of natural language structures in LLM representations, contributing a new tool for multi-scale conceptual analysis.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

*Shani Goren,Ido Galil,Ran El-Yaniv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with factual errors; Selective Abstraction (SA) reduces uncertain content's specificity, improving reliability and preserving meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from trust issues due to factual inaccuracies. Effective mechanisms to handle uncertainty are needed, especially for high-risk settings.

Method: Selective Abstraction (SA) replaces uncertain atomic claims in long-form responses with less specific, high-confidence abstractions.

Result: SA improved risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% compared to claim removal in tests using FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks.

Conclusion: Reducing specificity in uncertain content enhances accuracy and trustworthiness of LLM-generated text while retaining meaningful information.

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlphaPROBE, a framework for alpha factor mining in quantitative finance by leveraging a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for more structured discovery. It outperforms existing methods in predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alpha mining methods lack a global structural view, treating factor pools as isolated or fragmented, leading to redundant searches and limited diversity.

Method: AlphaPROBE reframes alpha mining as navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges. It includes two components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever and a DAG-aware Factor Generator.

Result: Extensive experiments on Chinese stock market datasets show AlphaPROBE's superior performance compared to 8 baselines in predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Global evolutionary topology in alpha mining improves efficiency and robustness substantially, making AlphaPROBE a promising solution for automated factor discovery.

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery. We have open-sourced our implementation at https://github.com/gta0804/AlphaPROBE.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MEME, a Logic-Oriented method to analyze financial markets as dynamic ecosystems of investment narratives, demonstrating improved performance in stock predictions and portfolio optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing LLM methods that focus either on asset-centric or market-centric approaches without incorporating the underlying logic driving market behaviors.

Method: The MEME framework models financial market dynamics using evolving investment narratives (called Modes of Thought). It uses a multi-agent extraction module for data sorting, Gaussian Mixture Modeling for consensus detection, and incorporates a temporal evaluation mechanism to track historical profitability and changes in the narratives.

Result: Experiments conducted on three diverse Chinese stock pools from 2023-2025 show MEME outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Additional studies validate its adaptiveness and cost-efficiency in identifying market consensus.

Conclusion: MEME is effective in prioritizing robust reasoning and enduring market wisdom, offering a reliable framework for financial market analysis and portfolio decisions. Its capacity to adapt to evolving market dynamics provides significant improvements over existing models.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/gta0804/MEME.

TL;DR: Gaia2 is a benchmark testing large language model agents in dynamic, asynchronous environments; it highlights trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in current model evaluations by assessing agents in evolving, real-time environments.

Method: Gaia2 uses scenarios paired with write-action verifiers to provide detailed evaluations directly applicable for reinforcement learning.

Result: Models like GPT-5 scored 42% pass@1 but show trade-offs, such as struggles with time-sensitive tasks. Open-source models like Kimi-K2 performed at 21% pass@1.

Conclusion: Gaia2 reveals critical challenges in adapting to dynamic environments, promoting development in practical agent systems through its extensible platform.

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

*Robert Cronshaw,Konstantinos Vilouras,Junyu Yan,Yuning Du,Feng Chen,Steven McDonagh,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSEval, a framework using language models to evaluate clinical semantic alignment between generated medical images and their prompts, addressing limitations in existing evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to assess whether generated medical images accurately reflect intended clinical semantics, creating a need for a tool that evaluates these aspects to ensure reliability and safety.

Method: CSEval employs language models to evaluate the clinical semantic alignment of generated images with conditioning prompts, filling gaps left by other metrics.

Result: Experiments show that CSEval detects semantic inconsistencies missed by other methods and correlates closely with expert assessments.

Conclusion: CSEval enhances current evaluation approaches by offering scalable and clinically meaningful semantic assessments, promoting the responsible use of generative models in healthcare.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

*Xiuping Wu,Zhao Yu,Yuxin Cheng,Ngai Wong,Liangjun Ke,Tapas Mishra,Konstantinos V. Katsikopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces behavior-based optimization techniques to improve reasoning in large language models without parameter updates, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze and utilize behavioral patterns in reasoning processes of large language models, as intuition-based approaches lack systematic examination.

Method: The study identifies adaptive behavioral patterns in reasoning tasks and proposes two optimization methods—InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt—to guide reasoning using past correct answers and a learned value function from behavioral patterns, respectively.

Result: The proposed methods improve reasoning performance by up to 5.34% (InjectCorrect) and 8.67% (InjectRLOpt) across various tasks without modifying model parameters.

Conclusion: Understanding and structurally injecting reasoning behavioral patterns can enhance model performance, making reasoning optimization more systematic and effective.

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

*Xinyu Yang,Chenlong Deng,Tongyu Wen,Binyu Xie,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent, employs an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy to ensure procedural compliance and accuracy in legal reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the issue of intermediate verification in legal reasoning, which is crucial to prevent errors such as inapplicable statute citations from propagating.

Method: LawThinker uses a DeepVerifier module to ensure accuracy, relevance, and compliance at each step, combined with a memory module for knowledge reuse, within an Explore-Verify-Memorize framework.

Result: LawThinker improves performance significantly on dynamic and static benchmarks, achieving 24% improvement over direct reasoning, 11% over workflow-based methods, and strong gains in process-oriented metrics.

Conclusion: LawThinker provides a robust mechanism for accurate and procedurally compliant legal reasoning, showcasing its effectiveness and generalization capabilities across benchmarks.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/yxy-919/LawThinker-agent .

### [60] [Tiny Recursive Reasoning with Mamba-2 Attention Hybrid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12078)
*Wenlong Wang,Fergal Reid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates improving recursive reasoning tasks by integrating Mamba-2 hybrid operators, showing better performance than traditional Transformer blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether introducing Mamba-2 hybrid operators in recursive reasoning scaffolds preserves reasoning capabilities and improves abstract reasoning.

Method: They replaced Transformer blocks in the TRM model with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity and evaluated performance on ARC-AGI-1 benchmarks.

Result: Replacing Transformer blocks with Mamba-2 operators led to improved pass@2 performance (+2.0%) and higher K values (+4.75% at pass@100), while maintaining pass@1 parity.

Conclusion: Mamba-2 hybrid operators are viable for recursive reasoning, improving model solution reliability and advancing recursive operator design strategies.

Abstract: Recent work on recursive reasoning models like TRM demonstrates that tiny networks (7M parameters) can achieve strong performance on abstract reasoning tasks through latent recursion -- iterative refinement in hidden representation space without emitting intermediate tokens. This raises a natural question about operator choice: Mamba-2's state space recurrence is itself a form of iterative refinement, making it a natural candidate for recursive reasoning -- but does introducing Mamba-2 into the recursive scaffold preserve reasoning capability? We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\% (45.88\% vs 43.88\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning.

*Antonin Sulc*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to debug semantic failures in multi-agent AI systems using Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent AI systems require reasoning about complex concepts like knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation—challenging with traditional modal logic that depends on static manual specifications.

Method: The authors implement DML through MLNNs, learning trust networks, causality chains, and regulatory bounds directly from behavioral data, and apply their framework to different modalities like epistemic, temporal, deontic, and doxastic reasoning.

Result: The framework provides interpretable structures, efficient sparse data learning, multi-modal reasoning capabilities, and practical tools for debugging, monitoring, and controlling multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: The approach advances neurosymbolic AI, offering a powerful debugging framework for multi-agent systems by combining differentiable learning with modal logic structures and reasoning modalities.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

### [62] [The Pensieve Paradigm: Stateful Language Models Mastering Their Own Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12108)
*Xiaoyuan Liu,Tian Liang,Dongyang Ma,Deyu Zhou,Haitao Mi,Pinjia He,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'StateLM,' a foundation model capable of managing and dynamically engineering its own memory state by using tools like context pruning and document indexing. It significantly improves performance across various tasks compared to standard LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models lack the capability to actively manage their memory and utilize context dynamically, which limits their effectiveness in tasks requiring extended reasoning and handling of long-context information.

Method: Develop a class of models, StateLM, with an internal reasoning loop and memory management tools (e.g., context pruning, document indexing). Train these models to dynamically engineer their own context and manage memory effectively, breaking free from the constraints of fixed context windows.

Result: StateLMs showed superior performance across multiple tasks: outperforming standard LLMs in long-document QA, achieving 10%-20% higher accuracy in chat memory tasks, and surpassing standard LLMs by substantial margins (5% vs 52%) in complex tasks like BrowseComp-Plus.

Conclusion: StateLM transforms language models into state-aware agents, equipping them with active reasoning capabilities and enabling dynamic memory management to overcome the limitations of traditional LLM architectures.

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

### [63] [Stop Unnecessary Reflection: Training LRMs for Efficient Reasoning with Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12113)
*Zewei Yu,Lirong Gao,Yuke Zhu,Bo Zheng,Sheng Guo,Haobo Wang,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by introducing ARLCP, a framework that improves reasoning efficiency and accuracy through adaptive penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models often generate unnecessarily long reasoning processes, leading to computational overhead and lower accuracy, especially for complex problems.

Method: The paper proposes ARLCP, which uses reinforcement learning with a reflection penalty to limit excessive reasoning and a length penalty calibrated to problem complexity.

Result: ARLCP reduces response length by over 50% for smaller models and 35% for larger models, while also improving accuracy by 5.8% and 2.7%, respectively.

Conclusion: ARLCP demonstrates a balanced trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, addressing the challenges of over-long and inefficient reasoning in Large Reasoning Models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

*Jittarin Jetwiriyanon,Teo Susnjak,Surangika Ranathunga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of forecasting university enrolments under data constraints and benchmarks advanced forecasting models, introducing novel covariates for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universities face financial pressure and require accurate enrolment forecasts; however, traditional models struggle with short, sparse, and volatile data.

Method: The authors benchmark several time series forecasting models (TSFMs), propose a new regime covariate Index (IOCI), and use Google Trends data with stabilized feature engineering.

Result: TSFMs with proposed covariates perform comparably to classical benchmarks in zero-shot settings, showing varied outcomes by cohort and model.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances forecasting reliability in data-sparse higher education contexts without needing institution-specific training.

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

### [65] [HLA: Hadamard Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12128)
*Hanno Ackermann,Hong Cai,Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA), an improved linear attention mechanism that employs a more effective nonlinear approach for approximating softmax, aimed at reducing computational costs while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers, while powerful, face computational inefficiency due to the quadratic cost of standard attention. Linear attention methods reduce this cost but compromise on the effectiveness of softmax approximations. Therefore, the authors aim to develop a method that balances efficiency and performance.

Method: The paper proposes HLA, a nonlinear approach applied post pairwise similarity computation (unlike existing linear attention methods). The method creates a higher-degree rational function approximation of softmax with an efficient computational design avoiding tensor reshaping.

Result: HLA is validated on a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, proving effective in handling extensive token computations without compromising efficiency.

Conclusion: Hadamard Linear Attention enhances the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy in attention mechanisms, offering a scalable solution for transformer models dealing with large data.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

*Roberto Balestri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study assesses bias in two major commercial image generators when using "neutral" prompts, identifying evident gender and skin-tone biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to uncover whether "neutral" prompts in image-generation AI models are actually resulting in neutral demographic representations.

Method: Using a sample of 3,200 images and employing advanced analytical pipelines, biases on skin tone and gender were evaluated using multiple metrics.

Result: Neutral prompts produced biased images with a default white (>96%) bias in both models. Gender biases varied: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT skewed towards male-presenting and lighter-skinned subjects.

Conclusion: Neutral prompts are diagnostic and reveal intrinsic biases in AI image-generation systems, challenging the notion of unmarked language producing inclusive outputs.

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Value Alignment Tax (VAT) to analyze how value alignment strategies affect interconnected values in AI systems, revealing systemic alignment risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring how AI interventions influence interconnected values dynamically, addressing limitations of static value relations in current models.

Method: Employing Schwartz value theory, paired pre-post normative judgments are analyzed using a controlled dataset to measure alignment-induced changes across models, values, and strategies.

Result: The study found structured co-movement among values due to alignment, unnoticed by traditional evaluation methods, highlighting systemic risks in alignment processes.

Conclusion: This framework provides deeper insights into value alignment dynamics, exposing hidden risks and informing effective alignment strategies for large language models.

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STAR framework effectively predicts AI model performance using statistical expectations and knowledge-driven reasoning, outperforming current methods especially under data sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to reliably predict large model performance due to issues like data sparsity, pattern shifts, and lack of interpretability. A more robust and explainable framework is needed.

Method: STAR integrates statistical expectations through Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) and combines it with knowledge-driven reasoning, guided by Expectation Violation Theory, for refined performance predictions.

Result: STAR achieves better performance compared to baselines, showing a 14.46% improvement in total score under severe data sparsity conditions, with only minimal observed scores available.

Conclusion: The STAR framework successfully addresses the challenges of model performance prediction under limited data, providing both accuracy and explainability through its hybrid statistical and reasoning-based approach.

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

*Mahdi Khodabandeh,Ghazal Shabani,Arash Yousefi Jordehi,Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel lossless data compression method using a T5 language model enhanced with Reinforcement Learning to compress data into token-based sequences, achieving high compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with complex data structures, and current machine learning-based compression often obscures underlying token structures. The need is for efficient compression methods preserving data structure and integrity.

Method: The method uses a T5 language model guided by off-policy Reinforcement Learning to compress data into token sequences instead of dense vectors, optimizing sequence length to reduce redundancy.

Result: The proposed model significantly outperforms conventional compression methods, achieving improved compression ratios while maintaining the semantic structure of the data.

Conclusion: The approach offers an adaptive and efficient compression system utilizing Reinforcement Learning, without reliance on explicit world knowledge, and provides a practical solution with broad potential applications.

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have a Theory of Mind (ToM), proposing a new evaluation framework beyond existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs succeed in social tasks, traditional benchmarks don't assess their possession of a causal model of mental states and behavior, which is central to ToM.

Method: The authors developed a cognitively-grounded evaluation framework to test whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent causal model of mental states and behaviors.

Result: Results indicate that LLMs approximate human judgments in simple ToM tasks but fail in logically equivalent tasks and show low consistency in predictions and mental state inferences.

Conclusion: LLMs’ demonstrated social proficiency does not arise from possessing a domain-general or consistent Theory of Mind.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sci-CoE, a scientific reasoning framework that improves LLMs by evolving them as both solvers and verifiers, using sparse supervision and unsupervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with scientific reasoning tasks due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies.

Method: Sci-CoE is a two-stage framework: first, it uses annotated data to establish judgment anchors; second, it employs a geometric reward mechanism for self-iteration on unlabeled data.

Result: Sci-CoE enhances reasoning capabilities and scalability, as demonstrated on scientific benchmarks, leading to robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Conclusion: Sci-CoE provides an effective way to strengthen LLMs for scientific reasoning through self-evolving and co-evolving mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Motivation: To address gaps in the original QBBN model: lack of negation/backward reasoning and the absence of a natural language parser.

Method: Improves QBBN inference with negation factors, introduces a typed logical language for semantics, and develops a slot grammar for deterministic parsing. LLMs preprocess and rerank sentences, while QBBN verifies inference.

Result: QBBN successfully handles natural deduction with negation, achieves zero ambiguity in logical form parsing with deterministic grammar, while showing that LLMs are inadequate for structured parsing without grammar.

Conclusion: The integration reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's 'bitter lesson,' leveraging LLMs as annotators and QBBN as verifiers, showing that structured grammar remains essential.

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

TL;DR: A pedagogically-inspired framework for knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models, showing improved efficiency and reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying efficient AI systems requires effective knowledge transfer from LLMs, but existing methods lack systematic pedagogical processes, inhibiting optimal performance in smaller models.

Method: The proposed IOA framework includes a three-stage pipeline (Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, Adapter) based on educational principles, dynamically structuring knowledge transfer through progressive curricula and adapting to student model capacity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the IOA framework enables student models to retain 94.7% of teacher performance with reduced parameters and significantly outperforms baselines in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The IOA method offers systematic and efficient distillation, improving smaller models' performance across complex tasks and advancing the practicality of deploying efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Ge Gao,Shuai Wang,Duolikun Danier,Bin Zhu,Stevan Rudinac,David Bull,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM3-LiteText, an efficient text encoder for vision-language segmentation that reduces computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies inefficiencies in current vision-language segmentation models like SAM3 due to over-provisioned text encoders, which are excessive for short, structured prompts used in segmentation tasks.

Method: The authors performed a large-scale analysis on 404,796 prompts to reveal redundancy in text encoders, leading to the design of SAM3-LiteText. This framework substitutes the SAM3 text encoder with a lightweight MobileCLIP model trained via knowledge distillation.

Result: Experiments show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by 88%, significantly lowering the memory footprint without compromising segmentation performance.

Conclusion: SAM3-LiteText effectively optimizes the text encoding process in vision-language segmentation, balancing efficiency with performance and offering a resource-friendly alternative for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

*Kaitlyn Zhou,Martijn Bartelds,Federico Bianchi,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current speech recognition systems struggle with high-stakes, context-specific tasks like transcribing U.S. street names, particularly for linguistically diverse speakers, where error rates are 44%. Using synthetic data generation improves transcription accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world speech recognition systems, particularly in high-stakes deployments, often fail despite strong benchmark performances, highlighting the need for scalable solutions.

Method: Evaluated 15 models from major providers on linguistically diverse U.S. speakers. Created synthetic diverse pronunciations with text-to-speech models and fine-tuned systems with fewer than 1,000 samples.

Result: Street name transcription accuracy improved by nearly 60%, especially for speakers with non-English primary language.

Conclusion: Benchmark performances do not always translate to real-world reliability in speech systems. Introducing diverse synthetic data effectively mitigates real-world transcription errors.

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

TL;DR: KeplerAgent is a framework leveraging large language models and physics-based tools to improve symbolic equation discovery through a structured reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance symbolic equation discovery by introducing an approach mimicking the scientific reasoning process, addressing limitations in existing LLM-based systems.

Method: KeplerAgent combines large language models and physics-based tools, integrating intermediate structures to configure symbolic regression methods like PySINDy and PySR.

Result: KeplerAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in symbolic accuracy and robustness under noisy data conditions.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning processes in symbolic equation discovery can help attain higher accuracy and better noise tolerance in physical benchmarks.

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

TL;DR: CM2 introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimizing tool-using AI agents by focusing on checklist rewards instead of verifiable outcome rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents face challenges in multi-turn, multi-step scenarios due to the lack of verifiable objectives, complex tool use, and costly tool setups.

Method: CM2 leverages fine-grained binary checklist rewards and reasoning with explicit evidence grounding. It uses a scalable tool environment simulated by a language model to train agents.

Result: CM2 outperforms supervised fine-tuning and other baselines across three benchmarks, achieving consistent performance improvements in various tool-use scenarios.

Conclusion: CM2 is a promising scalable approach to improve AI agents' tool use optimization without requiring verifiable rewards, making it versatile for many applications.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

TL;DR: CATTS (Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling) is a dynamic compute allocation method for multi-step agents, improving performance and reducing compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and diminishing returns observed in naive test-time scaling strategies for agentic, multi-step tasks.

Method: Investigates inference-time scaling in web agents, introduces dynamic compute allocation using vote-derived uncertainty statistics during decision-making.

Result: CATTS delivers improved performance (up to 9.1% better on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse) and reduces compute usage (up to 2.3x fewer tokens).

Conclusion: Dynamic scaling informed by agent uncertainty metrics can enhance efficiency and performance in long-horizon multi-task contexts.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this research is to overcome the challenges in RF physical synthesis where ML methods fail to produce manufacturable layouts due to oversimplified models and lack of routing functionalities.

Method: The authors propose a framework incorporating a neural network model trained on extensive inductor datasets, an intelligent layout optimizer, and a placement-routing engine for DRC-compliant and EM-accurate designs.

Result: The framework generates DRC-compliant RF layouts with high accuracy, achieving less than 2% error in predicting inductor Q-factor and optimizing layouts with a 93.77% success rate.

Conclusion: This framework addresses key challenges in RF physical design automation, providing accurate and manufacturable RF layouts and setting a foundation for automated RF layout design.

Abstract: This paper presents an ML-driven framework for automated RF physical synthesis that transforms circuit netlists into manufacturable GDSII layouts. While recent ML approaches demonstrate success in topology selection and parameter optimization, they fail to produce manufacturable layouts due to oversimplified component models and lack of routing capabilities. Our framework addresses these limitations through three key innovations: (1) a neural network framework trained on 18,210 inductor geometries with frequency sweeps from 1-100 GHz, generating 7.5 million training samples, that predicts inductor Q-factor with less than 2% error and enables fast gradient-based layout optimization with a 93.77% success rate in producing high-Q layouts; (2) an intelligent P-Cell optimizer that reduces layout area while maintaining design-rule-check (DRC) compliance; and (3) a complete placement and routing engine with frequency-dependent EM spacing rules and DRC-aware synthesis. The neural inductor model demonstrates superior accuracy across 1-100 GHz, enabling EM-accurate component synthesis with real-time inference. The framework successfully generates DRC-aware GDSII layouts for RF circuits, representing a significant step toward automated RF physical design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAM, a KV-centric serving system for Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing memory bandwidth and capacity challenges effectively with hierarchical PIM-enabled devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems cannot efficiently handle memory-intensive KV operations as they are optimized for compute-bound workloads.

Method: PAM introduces a hierarchical architecture and novel algorithms like PAMattention, alongside mechanisms for KV mapping, migration, and scheduling, to balance bandwidth and capacity.

Result: PAM significantly enhances efficiency and scalability for LLM serving systems while addressing memory bottlenecks.

Conclusion: PAM proves to be a cost-effective, high-performance solution for LLM serving systems in large-scale AI scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exponentially increased the demand for efficient serving systems. With growing requests and context lengths, key-value (KV)-related operations, including attention computation and KV cache storage, have emerged as critical bottlenecks. They require massive memory bandwidth and capacity. Unfortunately, existing LLM serving systems, optimized for compute-bound workloads, fail to handle these memory-intensive operations effectively. Even with Processing-In-Memory (PIM) technology, current single-level memory designs cannot simultaneously satisfy the bandwidth and capacity requirements.
  To address these challenges, we propose Processing Across Memory (PAM), a KV-centric LLM serving system that coordinates heterogeneous PIM-enabled memory devices within a hierarchical architecture. PAM introduces a novel computing paradigm to balance high memory bandwidth with scalable capacity. First, PAM exploits the inherent context locality in KV access patterns to intelligently distribute KV tokens across the memory hierarchy. Second, to further exploit context locality, it introduces the PAMattention algorithm, enabling fine-grained parallel attention computation across heterogeneous PIM devices. Finally, PAM incorporates an intra-device KV mapping, inter-device KV migration interface, and an inter-device online KV scheduling algorithm to dynamically balance computational workloads. By addressing both bandwidth and capacity demands simultaneously, PAM significantly enhances the efficiency and scalability of LLM serving systems, paving the way for cost-effective, high-performance solutions in the era of large-scale AI.

*Hao Zhen,Qingxuan Kang,Yungang Bao,Trevor E. Carlson*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Microarchitecture Cliffs,' a methodology for calibrating architectural simulators by identifying and isolating microarchitectural differences using specific benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in simulator fidelity, where architectural simulators deviate from final RTL designs, leading to unreliable performance modeling and decision-making.

Method: The paper proposes the 'Microarchitecture Cliffs' methodology to identify critical architectural components and isolate microarchitectural discrepancies for calibration. Automated tools facilitate this process, enabling precision in reducing simulation mismatches.

Result: Using the proposed methodology, the performance error of XS-GEM5 against XS-RTL is significantly reduced from 59.2% to 1.4% on specific benchmarks. Other results include a 48.03% reduction in error for a tightly coupled architectural feature and substantial performance error reductions in SPECint2017 and SPECfp2017.

Conclusion: The 'Microarchitecture Cliffs' methodology effectively enhances simulator calibration accuracy, demonstrating significant error reductions and improved consistency with RTL designs.

Abstract: Architectural simulators play a critical role in early microarchitectural exploration due to their flexibility and high productivity. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by fidelity: simulators may deviate from the behavior of the final RTL, leading to unreliable performance estimates. Consequently, model calibration, which aligns simulator behavior with the RTL as the ground-truth microarchitecture, becomes essential for achieving accurate performance modeling.
  To facilitate model calibration accuracy, we propose Microarchitecture Cliffs, a benchmark generation methodology designed to expose mismatches in microarchitectural behavior between the simulator and RTL. After identifying the key architectural components that require calibration, the Cliff methodology enables precise attribution of microarchitectural differences to a single microarchitectural feature through a set of benchmarks. In addition, we develop a set of automated tools to improve the efficiency of the Cliff workflow.
  We apply the Cliff methodology to calibrate the XiangShan version of gem5 (XS-GEM5) against the XiangShan open-source CPU (XS-RTL). We reduce the performance error of XS-GEM5 from 59.2% to just 1.4% on the Cliff benchmarks. Meanwhile, the calibration guided by Cliffs effectively reduces the relative error of a representative tightly coupled microarchitectural feature by 48.03%. It also substantially lowers the absolute performance error, with reductions of 15.1% and 21.0% on SPECint2017 and SPECfp2017, respectively.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of state-of-the-art MRAM interfaces for AFMTJs, specifically the challenges posed by ultrafast switching dynamics and low tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), which impact reliability.

Method: Using a calibrated SPICE AFMTJ model, the authors developed an asymmetric pulse driver for deterministic picosecond switching and a self-timed sense amplifier with dynamic trip-point tuning. They validated their models using SPICE and Monte Carlo evaluations under realistic scenarios.

Result: The proposed circuits retained AFMTJ latency and energy efficiency while offering robust read/write yields under process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations and 3D integration parasitics, outperforming conventional MRAM interfaces.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability and superiority of the proposed read/write interface for AFMTJs in terms of performance, robustness, and reliability, making it a promising solution for next-generation in-memory computing.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions (AFMTJs) offer picosecond switching and high integration density for in-memory computing, but their ultrafast dynamics and low tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) make state-of-the-art MRAM interfaces unreliable. This work develops a device-circuit co-designed read/write interface optimized for AFMTJ behavior. Using a calibrated SPICE AFMTJ model as a baseline, we identify the limitations of conventional drivers and propose an asymmetric pulse driver (PD) for deterministic picosecond switching and a self-timed sense amplifier (STSA) with dynamic trip-point tuning for low-TMR sensing. Our experiments using SPICE and Monte Carlo evaluations demonstrate that the proposed circuits preserve AFMTJ latency and energy benefits while achieving robust read/write yield under realistic PVT and 3D integration parasitics, outperforming standard MRAM front-ends under the same conditions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MING, an MLIR-based framework to optimize high-level synthesis for FPGA designs, achieving significant speedups and addressing resource constraints on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing high-level synthesis frameworks for FPGAs often fail to consider the strict resource constraints of edge devices despite the growing demand for low-latency machine learning applications on such platforms.

Method: MING leverages an MLIR-based framework that automates FPGA design using a streaming architecture and strategically managed buffers to handle resource constraints while maintaining superior performance.

Result: MING achieves an average of 15x speedup for standard CNN kernels and up to 200x for single-layer kernels, successfully handling larger input sizes without violating hardware resource constraints.

Conclusion: MING represents an efficient and resource-aware solution for generating FPGA designs tailored for edge applications, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in latency and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for low-latency and real-time processing, machine learning applications are steadily migrating toward edge computing platforms, where Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely adopted for their energy efficiency compared to CPUs and GPUs. To generate high-performance and low-power FPGA designs, several frameworks built upon High Level Synthesis (HLS) vendor tools have been proposed, among which MLIR-based frameworks are gaining significant traction due to their extensibility and ease of use. However, existing state-of-the-art frameworks often overlook the stringent resource constraints of edge devices. To address this limitation, we propose MING, an Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)-based framework that abstracts and automates the HLS design process. Within this framework, we adopt a streaming architecture with carefully managed buffers, specifically designed to handle resource constraints while ensuring low-latency. In comparison with recent frameworks, our approach achieves on average 15x speedup for standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) kernels with up to four layers, and up to 200x for single-layer kernels. For kernels with larger input sizes, MING is capable of generating efficient designs that respect hardware resource constraints, whereas state-of-the-art frameworks struggle to meet.

*Sungmoon Kim,Hyuna Jeon,Dahye Kim,Mingyu Kim,Dong-Kyu Chae,Jiwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HybridRAG enhances chatbot response accuracy and speed by pre-processing unstructured PDFs into a hierarchical QA knowledge base, reducing retrieval and computation during query time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG approaches rely on well-structured textual sources, limiting their effectiveness for real-world chatbots handling unstructured documents and requiring faster response times.

Method: HybridRAG converts unstructured PDFs into hierarchical text chunks using OCR and layout analysis, pre-generates a QA knowledge base using LLMs, and employs this database to provide faster responses to queries.

Result: Experiments on OHRBench show HybridRAG delivers higher-quality answers and faster response times compared to traditional RAG frameworks.

Conclusion: The framework is a feasible and efficient solution for chatbots recovering information from unstructured documents with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for grounding Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot responses on external knowledge. However, existing RAG studies typically assume well-structured textual sources (e.g. Wikipedia or curated datasets) and perform retrieval and generation at query time, which can limit their applicability in real-world chatbot scenarios. In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources.

*Max Zhang,Derek Liu,Kai Zhang,Joshua Franco,Haihao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of knowledge distillation (KD) for multilingual jailbreak prevention in large language models, revealing challenges and potential solutions in aligning safety across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the English-centric focus in large language model safety alignment and tackle vulnerabilities in non-English and low-resource languages, ensuring more robust global deployment.

Method: The authors applied knowledge distillation (KD) by transferring the safety-aligned refusal behaviors of a proprietary teacher model into three open-source student models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning and multilingual jailbreak prompts.

Result: The study uncovered that standard fine-tuning could inadvertently increase Jailbreak Success Rate (JSR) in student models, showing divergent generalizations across languages. Removing nuanced boundary refusals mitigated safety declines but at the cost of reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation for multilingual safety alignment shows promise but also significant challenges such as safety-performance trade-offs, providing insights for future research on improving LLM safety across languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, yet their safety alignment remains predominantly English-centric. This allows for vulnerabilities in non-English contexts, especially with low-resource languages. We introduce a novel application of knowledge distillation (KD) in the context of multilingual jailbreak prevention, examining its efficacy. We distill the refusal behaviors of a proprietary teacher model (OpenAI o1-mini) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into three open-source student models: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-2B-IT, and Qwen3-8B, using ~28,000 multilingual jailbreak prompts from XSafety via black-box response-based, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluation on the MultiJail benchmark reveals a counterintuitive behavior: standard fine-tuning on the teacher's ``safe'' refusal data inadvertently increases Jailbreak Success Rate (JSR) for all student models, up to 16.6 percentage points. Our experiments reveal a divergent generalization to unseen languages during distillation, with varying outcomes depending on the base model. By removing a primary source of safety degradation, nuanced `boundary' refusals, we mitigate or even reverse safety declines in student models, although reductions in reasoning performance (GSM8K) persist. Overall, our exploratory study highlights the challenges and potential of KD as a technique for multilingual safety alignment, offering a foundation for future research in this direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of "retrieval heads" in large language models (LLMs), revealing their temporal variability and predictive mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies identify retrieval heads in LLMs using static averages, neglecting the dynamic nature of autoregressive generation.

Method: The authors perform extensive analysis of retrieval heads over time, validating claims using tasks like Needle-in-a-Haystack and multi-hop QA, as well as exploring a Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework.

Result: Three main findings: (1) Retrieval heads dynamically vary across time; (2) Static retrieval heads are insufficient at capturing dynamic behavior; (3) Models internally plan retrieval head patterns, as evidenced by hidden state correlations.

Conclusion: Dynamic retrieval heads constitute an integral part of LLMs' generation processes, offering a deeper understanding to improve framework designs for dynamic retrieval.

Abstract: Recent studies have identified "retrieval heads" in Large Language Models (LLMs) responsible for extracting information from input contexts. However, prior works largely rely on static statistics aggregated across datasets, identifying heads that perform retrieval on average. This perspective overlooks the fine-grained temporal dynamics of autoregressive generation. In this paper, we investigate retrieval heads from a dynamic perspective. Through extensive analysis, we establish three core claims: (1) Dynamism: Retrieval heads vary dynamically across timesteps; (2) Irreplaceability: Dynamic retrieval heads are specific at each timestep and cannot be effectively replaced by static retrieval heads; and (3) Correlation: The model's hidden state encodes a predictive signal for future retrieval head patterns, indicating an internal planning mechanism. We validate these findings on the Needle-in-a-Haystack task and a multi-hop QA task, and quantify the differences on the utility of dynamic and static retrieval heads in a Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. Our study provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs.

*Muhammad Haris,Hans Höft,Markus M. Becker,Markus Stocker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Named Entity Recognition (NER) method for plasma physics research articles using encoder-transformers and conditional random fields (CRF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plasma physics articles contain complex, specialized text, posing challenges for extracting relevant entities to improve search and analysis processes.

Method: A lightweight approach combining encoder-transformers and CRF is utilized; a plasma physics corpus with 16 specialized classes is annotated; independent BERT-CRF models are trained per entity type; hyperparameter optimization enhances performance.

Result: The method successfully extracts nested named entities from plasma physics texts and improves model performance through entity-specific specialization and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The research advances entity recognition in plasma physics, providing tools to assist researchers in navigating scientific literature effectively.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in natural language processing that aims to identify and extract key entities from unstructured text. We present a novel application of NER in plasma physics research articles and address the challenges of extracting specialized entities from scientific text in this domain. Research articles in plasma physics often contain highly complex and context-rich content that must be extracted to enable, e.g., advanced search. We propose a lightweight approach based on encoder-transformers and conditional random fields to extract (nested) named entities from plasma physics research articles. First, we annotate a plasma physics corpus with 16 classes specifically designed for the nested NER task. Second, we evaluate an entity-specific model specialization approach, where independent BERT-CRF models are trained to recognize individual entity types in plasma physics text. Third, we integrate an optimization process to systematically fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance model performance. Our work contributes to the advancement of entity recognition in plasma physics and also provides a foundation to support researchers in navigating and analyzing scientific literature.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents RECOM, a dataset of 15,000 Reddit questions from September 2025 with reference answers, analyzing how LLMs handle recent information using multi-dimensional evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Large Language Models align with human-generated responses on temporally recent information and address limitations in traditional evaluation metrics.

Method: Authors developed RECOM, a benchmark of Reddit questions with community answers, and tested four open-source LLMs using diverse evaluation metrics (lexical, semantic, and logical inference).

Result: Models show high semantic fidelity but low lexical overlap, with Mistral-7B outperforming larger models like GPT-OSS-20B. Contradictions in model responses are minimal.

Conclusion: Lexical metrics are less reliable for evaluating abstractive generation; multi-dimensional frameworks are needed to better assess semantic alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for open-domain question answering, yet their alignment with human perspectives on temporally recent information remains underexplored. We introduce RECOM (Reddit Evaluation for Correspondence of Models), a benchmark dataset of 15,000 recent Reddit questions from September 2025 paired with community-derived reference answers. We investigate how four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and GPT-OSS-20B) respond to these questions, evaluating alignment using lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore, cosine similarity), and logical inference (NLI). Our central finding is a striking semantic-lexical paradox: all models achieve over 99% cosine similarity with references despite less than 8% BLEU-1 overlap, a 90+ percentage point gap indicating that models preserve meaning through extensive paraphrasing rather than lexical reproduction. MoverScore (51-53%) confirms this pattern, occupying an intermediate position that reflects the optimal transport cost of semantic alignment. Furthermore, model scale does not predict performance: Mistral-7B (7B parameters) outperforms GPT-OSS-20B (20B parameters) across all metrics. NLI analysis reveals that contradiction rates remain below 7%, suggesting models rarely generate content that directly conflicts with human consensus. These findings challenge the reliability of lexical metrics for evaluating abstractive generation and argue for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that capture semantic fidelity beyond surface-level text matching.

*Xu Hu,Yifan Zhang,Songtao Wei,Chen Zhao,Qiannan Li,Bingzhe Li,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on large language models' (LLMs) hallucination detection, showcasing its improvement across three backbones and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the impact of PEFT on the problem of hallucination in LLMs, particularly in fact-seeking QA datasets, and understand if such tuning enhances factual correctness.

Method: A systematic empirical study using three LLM backbones, three QA benchmarks, and seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods, examining semantic consistency, confidence, and entropy-based approaches.

Result: PEFT consistently improves hallucination detection abilities across various detection paradigms, enhancing AUROC scores significantly.

Conclusion: PEFT reshapes uncertainty representation and enhances hallucination detection, rather than injecting new factual knowledge.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks and are often assumed to improve factual correctness. However, how the parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods affect hallucination behavior remains insufficiently understood, especially on QA datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of PEFT on hallucination detection through a comprehensive empirical study across three open-weight LLM backbones and three fact-seeking QA benchmarks. For each model, we evaluate performance using seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods spanning three complementary approaches: semantic consistency based detectors, confidence based detectors, and entropy based detectors. This multifaceted evaluation enables us to characterize how PEFT reshapes uncertainty across different detection paradigms. In conclusion, our experimental results show that PEFT consistently strengthens hallucination detection ability, substantially improving AUROC across a wide range of hallucination detectors. Besides, further analyses using linear probes and representation diagnostics indicate that PEFT methods primarily reshapes how uncertainty is encoded and surfaced, comparing with injecting new factual knowledge into the models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FalseCite, a dataset for analyzing and benchmarking hallucinated responses caused by deceptive citations in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to systematically study and address hallucination issues in LLMs, particularly in sensitive fields where false information can have harmful consequences.

Method: The authors created FalseCite, a curated dataset to benchmark hallucinated outputs induced by fabricated citations, and tested various models like GPT-4o-mini, Falcon-7B, and Mistral 7-B. They further analyzed hidden state vectors to understand hallucination behaviors.

Result: Results showed increased hallucination in responses linked to deceptive citations, especially in GPT-4o-mini. The hidden state analysis revealed a distinct horn-like shape in vectors, whether hallucination occurred or not.

Conclusion: FalseCite is a valuable benchmark to study hallucinations and could aid in developing strategies to minimize such errors in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating nonsensical or false information that can be especially harmful in sensitive fields such as medicine or law. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce FalseCite, a curated dataset designed to capture and benchmark hallucinated responses induced by misleading or fabricated citations. Running GPT-4o-mini, Falcon-7B, and Mistral 7-B through FalseCite, we observed a noticeable increase in hallucination activity for false claims with deceptive citations, especially in GPT-4o-mini. Using the responses from FalseCite, we can also analyze the internal states of hallucinating models, visualizing and clustering the hidden state vectors. From this analysis, we noticed that the hidden state vectors, regardless of hallucination or non-hallucination, tend to trace out a distinct horn-like shape. Our work underscores FalseCite's potential as a foundation for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in future LLM research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing text classification for UN SDGs by combining intelligence from multiple models through Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) and the use of generative AI for synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve text classification for applications in social analysis and decision-making, particularly addressing challenges like unavailable, interrelated, or indistinct categories.

Method: A combinatorial fusion paradigm (CFA) was used to combine diverse classification models' outputs, supported by generative AI for synthetic data generation and comparison with human experts.

Result: The CFA technique achieves 96.73% accuracy, surpassing individual models and demonstrating complementary enhancement with human expert input.

Conclusion: CFA effectively combines diverse model outputs for improved classification, showcasing that machine intelligence and human expertise can complement and enhance each other.

Abstract: (Natural Language Processing) NLP techniques such as text classification and topic discovery are very useful in many application areas including information retrieval, knowledge discovery, policy formulation, and decision-making. However, it remains a challenging problem in cases where the categories are unavailable, difficult to differentiate, or are interrelated. Social analysis with human context is an area that can benefit from text classification, as it relies substantially on text data. The focus of this paper is to enhance the classification of text according to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by collecting and combining intelligence from multiple models. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), a system fusion paradigm using a rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD), has been used to enhance classifier methods by combining a set of relatively good and mutually diverse classification models. We use a generative AI model to generate synthetic data for model training and then apply CFA to this classification task. The CFA technique achieves 96.73% performance, outperforming the best individual model. We compare the outcomes with those obtained from human domain experts. It is demonstrated that combining intelligence from multiple ML/AI models using CFA and getting input from human experts can, not only complement, but also enhance each other.

*Mangadoddi Srikar Vardhan,Lekkala Sai Teja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the distinct roles of direction and magnitude in Transformer hidden states using angular and magnitude perturbations, discovering a dissociation in their functional roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether direction (orientation) and magnitude (vector norm) in Transformer hidden states serve distinct computational roles.

Method: Using L2-matched perturbation analysis to compare the effects of angular and magnitude perturbations on language modeling and syntactic processing in Pythia-family Transformer models.

Result: Angular perturbations severely harm language modeling accuracy, while magnitude perturbations disproportionately affect syntactic processing. The damage pathways also differ, with angular issues flowing through attention pathways and magnitude issues through LayerNorm pathways.

Conclusion: Direction and magnitude in Transformer hidden states have distinct computational roles, with attention and LayerNorm pathways mediating these effects. The findings refine the linear representation hypothesis and highlight architectural influences like RMSNorm and LayerNorm.

Abstract: Transformer hidden states encode information as high-dimensional vectors, yet whether direction (orientation in representational space) and magnitude (vector norm) serve distinct functional roles remains unclear. Studying Pythia-family models, we discover a striking cross-over dissociation: angular perturbations cause up to 42.9 more damage to language modeling loss, while magnitude perturbations cause disproportionately more damage to syntactic processing (20.4% vs.1.6% accuracy drop on subject-verb agreement).This finding is enabled by L2-matched perturbation analysis, a methodology ensuring that an gular and magnitude perturbations achieve identical Euclidean displacements. Causal intervention reveals that angular damage flows substantially through the attention pathways (28.4% loss recovery via attention repair), while magnitude damage flows partly through the LayerNorm pathways(29.9% recovery via LayerNorm repair). These patterns replicate across scales within the Pythia architecture family. These findings provide evidence that direction and magnitude support partially distinct computational roles in LayerNorm based architectures. The direction preferentially affects attentional routing, while magnitude modulates processing intensity for fine-grained syntactic judgments. We find different patterns in RMSNorm-based architectures, suggesting that the dissociation depends on architectural choices. Our results refine the linear representation hypothesis and have implications for model editing and interpretability research

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRIME, a framework to enhance algorithmic reasoning in large language models, achieving remarkable improvements in accuracy across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show limitations in algorithmic reasoning, which this paper aims to address with a new framework.

Method: The PRIME framework employs three agents (executor, verifier, and coordinator) and introduces a new benchmark (PRIME-Bench) for diverse reasoning tasks. Optimization is achieved through group relative policy optimization.

Result: PRIME significantly improves task accuracy, achieving up to a 250% relative gain compared to baseline approaches. Iterative verification prevents error propagation and benefits smaller models disproportionately.

Conclusion: PRIME provides a robust solution to algorithmic reasoning challenges in large language models, with scalable efficiency and significant accuracy enhancement, especially for smaller models.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks, yet their performance on algorithmic reasoning remains limited. To handle this limitation, we propose PRIME (Policy-Reinforced Iterative Multi-agent Execution), a framework comprising three specialized agents, an executor for step-by-step reasoning, a verifier for constraint checking, and a coordinator for backtracking control, optimized through group relative policy optimization. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PRIME-Bench, the largest algorithmic reasoning benchmark to date, comprising 86 tasks across 12 categories with 51,600 instances. Tasks span sorting algorithms, graph and tree structures, automata and state machines, symbolic reasoning, and constraint-based puzzles, with execution traces reaching over one million steps. Compared to baseline approach, PRIME improves average accuracy from 26.8% to 93.8%, a 250% relative gain. The largest improvements occur on tasks requiring sustained state tracking, with Turing machine simulation improving from 9% to 92% and long division from 16% to 94%. Ablation studies identify iterative verification as the primary contributor, preventing the error propagation that causes baseline approaches to fail catastrophically. Analysis across model scales (8B-120B parameters) reveals that smaller models benefit disproportionately, achieving accuracy comparable to models 8x larger.

*Baek Seong-Eun,Lee Jung-Mok,Kim Sung-Bin,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining Bayesian Optimization with pre-trained LLMs to efficiently search hyperparameters for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enhancing resource-efficient adaptation and reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of hyperparameter tuning for LoRA, which is sensitive and computationally expensive, while utilizing pre-trained LLMs' domain knowledge.

Method: Introduce LLM-driven domain-aware Bayesian Optimization using textual prompts for LoRA hyperparameter tuning, supported by proxy training using subset datasets.

Result: Efficient hyperparameter search using the method surpasses standard approaches, achieving 20% performance improvement within just 30 iterations compared to exhaustive 45,000 combinations.

Conclusion: Efficient integration of LLM domain knowledge into BO reduces computational costs and improves LoRA adaptation, showcasing significant performance improvements in optimization.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables resource-efficient personalization or specialization, but it comes at the expense of additional hyperparameter tuning. Although LoRA makes fine-tuning efficient, it is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and exhaustive hyperparameter search is still computationally very demanding. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates the domain knowledge of pre-trained LLMs into Bayesian Optimization (BO) to efficiently search for LoRA hyperparameters. To leverage the informed knowledge of LLMs, we repurpose LLMs as a discrete-to-continuous mapping to link the hyperparameters and their domain knowledge with a continuous vector space, where BO is conducted. We design and control the mapping by language prompting, where we provide a domain-aware textual prompt describing the relationships among hyperparameters and their respective roles; thereby, we explicitly inject domain knowledge about LoRA into the LLM in natural language. Also, we model the residual information that is hard to linguistically describe in the prompt with an additional learnable token. This aids BO to sample more high-performing hyperparameters. In addition, by leveraging the observation of the strong correlation between the respective performance obtained from full and subset training datasets in LoRA training regimes, we introduce proxy training and evaluation with a data subset. This further increases the efficiency of our method. We demonstrate that our hyperparameter found with only about 30 iterations achieves more than 20% performance improvement over standard hyperparameters found from about 45,000 combinations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the readiness of multilingual TTS technology to replicate persuasive legal advocacy in linguistically diverse contexts, particularly in India.

Method: A prompting framework was employed utilizing Gemini 2.5's support for multilingual synthesis and its context-aware pacing to test advocacy tones in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Hindi, and Gujarati languages.

Result: The models excelled at delivering procedural content with 'monotone authority' but struggled with dynamic vocal modulation and emotional gravitas needed for persuasive advocacy. Performance issues were noted in Bengali and Gujarati.

Conclusion: Multilingual TTS shows promise for procedural legal tasks but faces challenges in achieving the emotive and persuasive qualities required for effective legal advocacy.

Abstract: Legal advocacy requires a unique combination of authoritative tone, rhythmic pausing for emphasis, and emotional intelligence. This study investigates the performance of the Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS and Gemini 2.5 Pro TTS models in generating synthetic courtroom speeches across five Indic languages: Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Hindi, and Gujarati. We propose a prompting framework that utilizes Gemini 2.5s native support for 5 languages and its context-aware pacing to produce distinct advocate personas. The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted the focus of TexttoSpeech (TTS) technology from basic intelligibility to context-aware, expressive synthesis. In the legal domain, synthetic speech must convey authority and a specific professional persona a task that becomes significantly more complex in the linguistically diverse landscape of India. The models exhibit a "monotone authority," excelling at procedural information delivery but struggling with the dynamic vocal modulation and emotive gravitas required for persuasive advocacy. Performance dips in Bengali and Gujarati further highlight phonological frontiers for future refinement. This research underscores the readiness of multilingual TTS for procedural legal tasks while identifying the remaining challenges in replicating the persuasive artistry of human legal discourse.

TL;DR: This paper introduces REspGen, a generation framework for author response writing in peer reviews, integrating author input and evaluation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of author response writing in scientific peer reviews, leveraging authors' domain expertise and intent.

Method: REspGen combines author-in-loop input, multi-attribute control, and evaluation-guided refinement. A large-scale dataset, Re^3Align, is created to support this framework.

Result: Experiments with leading LLMs showcased improved author response quality, controllability, and input utilization when using REspGen.

Conclusion: Integrating author insights and evaluation metrics better supports effective peer review response writing, with tools and datasets made available for further development.

Abstract: Author response (rebuttal) writing is a critical stage of scientific peer review that demands substantial author effort. Recent work frames this task as automatic text generation, underusing author expertise and intent. In practice, authors possess domain expertise, author-only information, revision and response strategies--concrete forms of author expertise and intent--to address reviewer concerns, and seek NLP assistance that integrates these signals to support effective response writing in peer review. We reformulate author response generation as an author-in-the-loop task and introduce REspGen, a generation framework that integrates explicit author input, multi-attribute control, and evaluation-guided refinement, together with REspEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite with 20+ metrics covering input utilization, controllability, response quality, and discourse. To support this formulation, we construct Re$^3$Align, the first large-scale dataset of aligned review--response--revision triplets, where revisions provide signals of author expertise and intent. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs show the benefits of author input and evaluation-guided refinement, the impact of input design on response quality, and trade-offs between controllability and quality. We make our dataset, generation and evaluation tools publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights how tokenization in multilingual models disproportionately impacts certain scripts, leading to processing inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how tokenization affects different scripts in pretrained multilingual models and its implications for processing equity.

Method: The study compares orthographic variants of the same linguistic content, measuring token fragmentation, inference speed, and processing costs using metrics like BPC and a round-trip conversion check.

Result: Higher-fragmentation orthographies faced a ~3.4x increase in tokenization, a 16.5x inference slowdown, and significant additional information costs, confirmed as orthography effects rather than noise.

Conclusion: Tokenization introduces bias against certain scripts in multilingual NLP, prompting the need for script-aware tokenization and pretraining methods.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual language models are often assumed to be script-agnostic, yet their tokenizers can impose systematic costs on certain writing systems. We quantify this script tax by comparing two orthographic variants with identical linguistic content. Across mBERT and XLM-R, the higher-fragmentation orthography shows a ~3.4x increase in fertility (6.73-6.85 vs. 2.10-2.35 tokens/word), leading to a 16.5x inference slowdown (0.23 vs. 3.8 sentences/second) on identical hardware. Using bits per character (BPC) to avoid the "NLL paradox" from subword fragmentation, we find a substantial increase in information cost: +19.7% for mBERT (8.06->9.65) and +47.1% for XLM-R (12.19->17.94). A round-trip conversion check (CER_rt=0.31) suggests these gaps reflect orthography-conditioned processing rather than mapping noise. Our results highlight tokenization as a key source of inequity in multilingual NLP and motivate script-aware tokenization and pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate why transformers, despite excelling at pattern matching and interpolation, struggle with exact symbolic computations such as arithmetic and logical inference.

Method: The authors synthesize recent studies and theoretical frameworks—circuit complexity, approximation theory, and communication complexity—to identify barriers in transformer's computational capabilities.

Result: The findings highlight structural and computational challenges like depth constraints, issues with approximating discontinuities, and communication bottlenecks among tokens.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current transformers face inherent theoretical limitations in discrete reasoning but offers insights into potential model design improvements and future research directions to address these constraints.

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundational architecture for a broad spectrum of sequence modeling applications, underpinning state-of-the-art systems in natural language processing, vision, and beyond. However, their theoretical limitations in discrete reasoning tasks, such as arithmetic, logical inference, and algorithmic composition, remain a critical open problem. In this survey, we synthesize recent studies from three theoretical perspectives: circuit complexity, approximation theory, and communication complexity, to clarify the structural and computational barriers that transformers face when performing symbolic computations. By connecting these established theoretical frameworks, we provide an accessible and unified account of why current transformer architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms, even as they excel at pattern matching and interpolation. We review key definitions, seminal results, and illustrative examples, highlighting challenges such as depth constraints, difficulty approximating discontinuities, and bottlenecks in inter-token communication. Finally, we discuss implications for model design and suggest promising directions for overcoming these foundational limitations.

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to anticipate human activities and durations in adaptive systems by leveraging compact contextual cues. It demonstrates their strong temporal reasoning even in low-data environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of existing agent-based models in low-data environments and explore the potential of LLMs trained on broad human knowledge for reasoning about everyday activities.

Method: A retrieval-augmented prompting strategy was applied, incorporating four types of context (temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona), and tested on two tasks using the CASAS Aruba dataset: next-activity prediction with duration estimation and daily sequence generation.

Result: LLMs showed strong temporal understanding in predicting human activities even in zero-shot settings, with performance improving with a few contextual examples but saturating quickly. Consistent temporal alignment was observed across conditions.

Conclusion: Pre-trained language models can effectively capture recurring patterns and adaptive behavioral variations, suggesting their utility in enhancing agent-based models for temporal reasoning and adaptive system applications.

Abstract: Anticipating human activities and their durations is essential in applications such as smart-home automation, simulation-based architectural and urban design, activity-based transportation system simulation, and human-robot collaboration, where adaptive systems must respond to human activities. Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in early detection of Alzheimer's disease due to limited labeled data and the untapped potential of LLMs in this specific domain.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs, analyzing internal representations, employing probing techniques, designing task-aware special markers, and synthesizing diagnostic data.

Result: Detection improvements are observed via probing transformations, and synthesized data contribute to enhancing downstream performance.

Conclusion: Task-aware markers and synthetic data generation using fine-tuned LLMs effectively advance diagnosis capabilities in the Alzheimer's domain.

Abstract: Reliable early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging, particularly due to limited availability of labeled data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong transfer capabilities across domains, adapting them to the AD domain through supervised fine-tuning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we fine-tune an LLM for AD detection and investigate how task-relevant information is encoded within its internal representations. We employ probing techniques to analyze intermediate activations across transformer layers, and we observe that, after fine-tuning, the probing values of specific words and special markers change substantially, indicating that these elements assume a crucial role in the model's improved detection performance. Guided by this insight, we design a curated set of task-aware special markers and train a sequence-to-sequence model as a data-synthesis tool that leverages these markers to generate structurally consistent and diagnostically informative synthetic samples. We evaluate the synthesized data both intrinsically and by incorporating it into downstream training pipelines.

  This survey aims to help fill that gap by outlining recent developments in prompt engineering, and their effect on different NLG tasks. It reviews recent advances in prompting methods and their impact on NLG tasks, presenting prompt design as an input-level control mechanism that complements fine-tuning and decoding approaches. The paper introduces a taxonomy of prompting paradigms, a decision framework for prompt selection based on varying factors for the practitioners, outlines emerging trends and challenges, and proposes a framework that links design, optimization, and evaluation to support more controllable and generalizable NLG.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the importance of developing automated, scalable interpretability techniques, and suggest cross-model generalization of circuits and new alignment methods for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their internal decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Mechanistic interpretability (i.e., the systematic study of how neural networks implement algorithms through their learned representations and computational structures) has emerged as a critical research direction for understanding and aligning these models. This paper surveys recent progress in mechanistic interpretability techniques applied to LLM alignment, examining methods ranging from circuit discovery to feature visualization, activation steering, and causal intervention. We analyze how interpretability insights have informed alignment strategies including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), constitutional AI, and scalable oversight. Key challenges are identified, including the superposition hypothesis, polysemanticity of neurons, and the difficulty of interpreting emergent behaviors in large-scale models. We propose future research directions focusing on automated interpretability, cross-model generalization of circuits, and the development of interpretability-driven alignment techniques that can scale to frontier models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in code-switching and code-mixing environments, as current models exhibit weaknesses in grammaticality, factuality, and safety behavior.

Method: A unifying taxonomy was proposed to organize prior research on data, modeling, and evaluation of LLMs in code-switching contexts, alongside actionable recommendations for adaptation and improved evaluation practices.

Result: Practical guidelines for building and enhancing CSW-capable LLMs, critiques of existing benchmarks for their biases, analysis of safety concerns like bypass mechanisms, and identification of open challenges.

Conclusion: The study offers a systematic approach to understanding and enhancing CSW within LLMs, contributing to better modeling, evaluation, and handling of safety-related issues.

Abstract: Code-mixing and code-switching (CSW) remain challenging phenomena for large language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in multilingual modeling, LLMs often struggle in mixed-language settings, exhibiting systematic degradation in grammaticality, factuality, and safety behavior. This work provides a comprehensive overview of CSW research in modern large language model settings. We introduce a unifying taxonomy that organizes prior work along dimensions of data, modeling, and evaluation, and we distill these findings into a practical playbook of actionable recommendations for building, adapting, and evaluating CSW-capable LLMs. We review modeling approaches ranging from CSW-tailored pre-training and task-specific post-training to prompting strategies and in-context learning. We analyze current evaluation practices, highlighting sources of instability and limited reproducibility, and we catalog existing benchmarks while critically examining their linguistic coverage and English-centric biases. Finally, we discuss emerging safety concerns, including use of code-mixing as a mechanism for bypassing model safeguards, and identify open research challenges.

TL;DR: MetaMem is a framework for enhancing memory systems in Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing a meta-memory to effectively utilize historical interactions, improving reasoning and memory integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory systems for LLMs struggle to maintain logical and temporal relationships in human-LLM interactions, leading to fragmented memory and weakened reasoning capabilities.

Method: MetaMem introduces a self-evolving meta-memory within LLM systems, utilizing self-reflection on reasoning processes to iteratively optimize the memories and systematically integrate evidence from fragmented memory units.

Result: MetaMem improves performance in human-LLM interactions, surpassing strong baseline methods by over 3.6%, demonstrating superior memory integration and reasoning.

Conclusion: MetaMem effectively addresses issues of fragmented memory in LLMs by providing a framework for systematic evidence integration, establishing a significant advancement in memory-driven reasoning tasks in AI.

Abstract: Existing memory systems enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to support long-horizon human-LLM interactions by persisting historical interactions beyond limited context windows. However, while recent approaches have succeeded in constructing effective memories, they often disrupt the inherent logical and temporal relationships within interaction sessions, resulting in fragmented memory units and degraded reasoning performance. In this paper, we propose MetaMem, a novel framework that augments memory systems with a self-evolving meta-memory, aiming to teach LLMs how to effectively utilize memorized knowledge. During meta-memory optimization, MetaMem iteratively distills transferable knowledge utilization experiences across different tasks by self-reflecting on reasoning processes and performing actions to update the current meta-memory state. The accumulated meta-memory units serve as explicit knowledge utilization experiences, guiding the LLM to systematically identify and integrate critical evidence from scattered memory fragments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaMem, which significantly outperforms strong baselines by over 3.6%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDL2PropBank, a benchmark for evaluating the developer experience of multi-agent frameworks in mapping relational database schemas. It implements identical agent logic across 10 frameworks, analyzing code complexity and AI-assistability, and finds Agno as the top performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a principled approach to evaluate multi-agent frameworks for LLM-driven software development in a controlled way.

Method: Developed the DDL2PropBank benchmark task for mapping database schemas to PropBank rolesets. They used the Agent-as-a-Tool pattern to implement agent logic across 10 frameworks, followed by evaluation based on code complexity and AI-assistability.

Result: Agno and Pydantic AI required the least implementation effort. Structural alignment scores served as reliable success indicators for frameworks with single canonical patterns; Agno demonstrated the best performance with high accuracy and alignment.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for structured evaluation of multi-agent frameworks and demonstrates that Agno offers a strong balance of low complexity and high AI-assistability.

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks promise to simplify LLM-driven software development, yet there is no principled way to evaluate their developer experience in a controlled setting. We introduce DDL2PropBank, a novel benchmark task that maps relational database schemas to PropBank rolesets, requiring autonomous retrieval of candidate frames and fine-grained linguistic reasoning over table names, columns, and relations. Using the Agent-as-a-Tool pattern, we implement identical agent logic across 10 frameworks and evaluate along two dimensions: (i) code complexity via static analysis, and (ii) AI-assistability -- the extent to which LLMs can autonomously generate correct, framework-specific code. Our results reveal a threefold complexity spectrum, with Pydantic AI and Agno requiring the least implementation overhead. For AI-assistability, structural alignment scores reliably proxy runtime success for frameworks with single canonical patterns, but overestimate correctness for multi-pattern frameworks. Agno emerges as the strongest overall performer, combining lowest complexity with highest structural alignment and 83% pass@1.

### [107] [When and What to Ask: AskBench and Rubric-Guided RLVR for LLM Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11199)
*Jiale Zhao,Ke Fang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AskBench, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on making appropriate clarifications in ambiguous or misleading situations, along with a reinforcement learning approach to improve the models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often respond to prompts with missing or misleading details, leading to errors (hallucinations or misconceptions). The motivation is to develop systems that know when and how to ask for clarification to avoid such issues.

Method: The authors introduce AskBench, a benchmark that creates multi-turn interactions from regular QA pairs by incorporating checkpoints. It includes two modes: AskMind for ambiguous queries and AskOverconfidence for queries with false premises. They also propose reinforcement learning guided by rubrics (RLVR) to improve models' clarification skills.

Result: Experiments with RLVR demonstrate consistent improvement in model accuracy, alignment with rubrics, and efficiency of interactions. These gains also generalize well to domains not seen during training.

Conclusion: The benchmark and RL method show promise for refining LLMs' ability to handle ambiguous and misleading prompts, suggesting their utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond even when prompts omit critical details or include misleading information, leading to hallucinations or reinforced misconceptions. We study how to evaluate and improve LLMs' ability to decide when and what to ask for clarification without sacrificing task performance. We introduce AskBench, an interactive benchmark that converts standard QA pairs into multi-turn interactions with explicit checkpoints. A unified judge loop evaluates final answers and simulates user responses as needed. AskBench covers two settings: AskMind, with intent-deficient queries requiring clarification, and AskOverconfidence, with queries containing false premises that must be identified and corrected. We further propose rubric-guided reinforcement learning with verifier-based rewards (RLVR), which uses structured rubrics to encourage targeted clarification. Experiments show consistent improvements in accuracy, rubric adherence, and interaction efficiency, with strong generalization to unseen domains.

### [108] [Mechanistic Evidence for Faithfulness Decay in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11201)
*Donald Ye,Max Loffgren,Om Kotadia,Linus Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a metric, Normalized Logit Difference Decay (NLDD), to measure whether the step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations truly reflect how language models make decisions or are just post-hoc justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of robust methods to determine if CoT explanations in language models reflect genuine reasoning processes or are merely superficial justifications.

Method: The authors propose NLDD, which quantifies the significance of individual reasoning steps by corrupting explanation steps and analyzing how much the model's confidence in its answer drops. NLDD also enables cross-model comparisons by standardizing these measurements.

Result: Experiments with different model families and tasks reveal a consistent Reasoning Horizon (70-85% of chain length) beyond which reasoning steps have minimal or negative impact. It also shows that models can have correct internal reasoning while failing the task, indicating accuracy is insufficient in judging reasoning.

Conclusion: NLDD provides a reliable method to evaluate the fidelity of CoT explanations and measure when they are significant in helping models reason.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations are widely used to interpret how language models solve complex problems, yet it remains unclear whether these step-by-step explanations reflect how the model actually reaches its answer, or merely post-hoc justifications. We propose Normalized Logit Difference Decay (NLDD), a metric that measures whether individual reasoning steps are faithful to the model's decision-making process. Our approach corrupts individual reasoning steps from the explanation and measures how much the model's confidence in its answer drops, to determine if a step is truly important. By standardizing these measurements, NLDD enables rigorous cross-model comparison across different architectures. Testing three model families across syntactic, logical, and arithmetic tasks, we discover a consistent Reasoning Horizon (k*) at 70--85% of chain length, beyond which reasoning tokens have little or negative effect on the final answer. We also find that models can encode correct internal representations while completely failing the task. These results show that accuracy alone does not reveal whether a model actually reasons through its chain. NLDD offers a way to measure when CoT matters.

*Beichen Guo,Zhiyuan Wen,Jia Gu,Senzhang Wang,Haochen Shi,Ruosong Yang,Shuaiqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SurveyLens, a benchmark to evaluate Automatic Survey Generation (ASG) methods against diverse academic discipline standards using a curated dataset and a novel evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing scientific literature necessitates ASG systems tailored to distinct research disciplines, but current evaluation metrics are biased toward Computer Science (CS) and lack discipline-specific standards.

Method: The authors developed SurveyLens, including a dataset of 1,000 human-written surveys from 10 disciplines, and introduced a dual-lens evaluation framework combining discipline-aware rubric evaluation and canonical alignment.

Result: The evaluation of 11 state-of-the-art ASG methods reveals their strengths and weaknesses across various disciplines, aiding in tool selection that matches disciplinary needs.

Conclusion: SurveyLens provides a valuable, discipline-aware benchmark for evaluating ASG methods, guiding researchers in utilizing tools aligned with specific academic field requirements.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature has driven the evolution of Automatic Survey Generation (ASG) from simple pipelines to multi-agent frameworks and commercial Deep Research agents. However, current ASG evaluation methods rely on generic metrics and are heavily biased toward Computer Science (CS), failing to assess whether ASG methods adhere to the distinct standards of various academic disciplines. Consequently, researchers, especially those outside CS, lack clear guidance on using ASG systems to yield high-quality surveys compliant with specific discipline standards. To bridge this gap, we introduce SurveyLens, the first discipline-aware benchmark evaluating ASG methods across diverse research disciplines. We construct SurveyLens-1k, a curated dataset of 1,000 high-quality human-written surveys spanning 10 disciplines. Subsequently, we propose a dual-lens evaluation framework: (1) Discipline-Aware Rubric Evaluation, which utilizes LLMs with human preference-aligned weights to assess adherence to domain-specific writing standards; and (2) Canonical Alignment Evaluation to rigorously measure content coverage and synthesis quality against human-written survey papers. We conduct extensive experiments by evaluating 11 state-of-the-art ASG methods on SurveyLens, including Vanilla LLMs, ASG systems, and Deep Research agents. Our analysis reveals the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm across fields, providing essential guidance for selecting tools tailored to specific disciplinary requirements.

*Usman Naseem,Gautam Siddharth Kashyap,Rafiq Ali,Ebad Shabbir,Sushant Kumar Ray,Abdullah Mohammad,Agrima Seth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing the Mis-Align Bench, a benchmark for evaluating misalignment across safety, value, and cultural dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a comprehensive evaluation framework to address the real-world query misalignment challenges in LLMs since existing benchmarks only evaluate single dimensions (safety, value, or culture) in isolation.

Method: The study introduces SAVACU, a dataset with 382,424 samples classified into safety, value, and cultural domains and pairs prompts with misaligned/aligned responses using rejection sampling. It benchmarks multiple LLMs under these dimensions.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that single-dimension models reach high coverage (up to 97.6%) but perform poorly (False Failure Rate >50%) and have low alignment scores (63%-66%) under joint conditions.

Conclusion: Mis-Align Bench provides a unified tool to evaluate misalignments across safety, value, and cultural dimensions, showcasing the limitations of current single-dimension-focused LLMs in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises when model behavior diverges from human expectations and fails to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, which must co-occur in real-world settings to solve a real-world query. Existing misalignment benchmarks-such as INSECURE CODE (safety-centric), VALUEACTIONLENS (value-centric), and CULTURALHERITAGE (culture centric)-rely on evaluating misalignment along individual dimensions, preventing simultaneous evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce Mis-Align Bench, a unified benchmark for analyzing misalignment across safety, value, and cultural dimensions. First we constructs SAVACU, an English misaligned-aligned dataset of 382,424 samples spanning 112 domains (or labels), by reclassifying prompts from the LLM-PROMPT-DATASET via taxonomy into 14 safety domains, 56 value domains, and 42 cultural domains using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and expanding low-resource domains via Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with SimHash-based fingerprint to avoid deduplication. Furthermore, we pairs prompts with misaligned and aligned responses via two-stage rejection sampling to enforce quality. Second we benchmarks general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs, enabling systematic evaluation of misalignment under three dimensions. Empirically, single-dimension models achieve high Coverage (upto 97.6%) but incur False Failure Rate >50% and lower Alignment Score (63%-66%) under joint conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to study behavioral tendencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) using adapted psychological measures, revealing significant deviations from human preferences in behavioral patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the behavioral dispositions of LLMs and investigate how their responses in social contexts align with human preferences, as LLMs are increasingly integrated into everyday lives.

Method: The authors adapt psychological questionnaires by converting them into Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs), generating 2,500 SJTs validated by human annotators, and conducting experiments with 25 LLMs to analyze behavioral alignment.

Result: The study highlights discrepancies between LLMs and human preferences: overconfidence in low-consensus scenarios, deviation in high-consensus cases, and distinctive cross-LLM traits like encouraging emotion expression contrary to human consensus.

Conclusion: The findings suggest behavioral misalignments in LLMs, emphasize gaps in predictive validity between stated values and actions, and propose situational judgment frameworks as effective tools for assessing and improving LLM behavior.

Abstract: As LLMs integrate into our daily lives, understanding their behavior becomes essential. In this work, we focus on behavioral dispositions$-$the underlying tendencies that shape responses in social contexts$-$and introduce a framework to study how closely the dispositions expressed by LLMs align with those of humans. Our approach is grounded in established psychological questionnaires but adapts them for LLMs by transforming human self-report statements into Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs). These SJTs assess behavior by eliciting natural recommendations in realistic user-assistant scenarios. We generate 2,500 SJTs, each validated by three human annotators, and collect preferred actions from 10 annotators per SJT, from a large pool of 550 participants. In a comprehensive study involving 25 LLMs, we find that models often do not reflect the distribution of human preferences: (1) in scenarios with low human consensus, LLMs consistently exhibit overconfidence in a single response; (2) when human consensus is high, smaller models deviate significantly, and even some frontier models do not reflect the consensus in 15-20% of cases; (3) traits can exhibit cross-LLM patterns, e.g., LLMs may encourage emotion expression in contexts where human consensus favors composure. Lastly, mapping psychometric statements directly to behavioral scenarios presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the predictive validity of self-reports, revealing considerable gaps between LLMs' stated values and their revealed behavior.

*Zachary Pedram Dadfar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates if self-referential outputs in large language models reflect genuine internal computations. Using a new protocol, "Pull Methodology," the authors identify and analyze activation patterns linked to self-referential processing, finding meaningfully correlated results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether self-reflective language produced by large language models is indicative of actual computational processes or merely artificial confabulation.

Method: The authors designed the Pull Methodology to create conditions for extended self-examination within models, analyzed directional activation patterns in Llama 3.1, and compared results with another model, Qwen 2.5-32B.

Result: The study identified a specific activation direction linked to self-referential language, distinct from other processing patterns. Models exhibited distinct activation correlations when producing introspective vocabulary. This behavior was not present in descriptive contexts.

Conclusion: Properly elicited self-referential outputs can reliably reflect the internal computational states of language models, providing insights into their inner workings.

Abstract: Large language models produce rich introspective language when prompted for self-examination, but whether this language reflects internal computation or sophisticated confabulation has remained unclear. We show that self-referential vocabulary tracks concurrent activation dynamics, and that this correspondence is specific to self-referential processing. We introduce the Pull Methodology, a protocol that elicits extended self-examination through format engineering, and use it to identify a direction in activation space that distinguishes self-referential from descriptive processing in Llama 3.1. The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce "loop" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce "shimmer" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002). Critically, the same vocabulary in non-self-referential contexts shows no activation correspondence despite nine-fold higher frequency. Qwen 2.5-32B, with no shared training, independently develops different introspective vocabulary tracking different activation metrics, all absent in descriptive controls. The findings indicate that self-report in transformer models can, under appropriate conditions, reliably track internal computational states.

*Weili Shi,Dongliang Guo,Lehan Yang,Tianlong Wang,Hanzhang Yuan,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the PPCV framework to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by identifying and addressing errors related to critical tokens in intermediate steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel in reasoning tasks but struggle with complex ones due to issues like hallucinations and error accumulation. Identifying critical tokens in these processes is essential to address these challenges.

Method: The proposed PPCV framework operates in two stages: (1) Identifying critical tokens through mismatches in reasoning paths between original and paraphrased questions, and confirming them with a specific criterion. (2) Replacing identified critical tokens and verifying consistency in new reasoning paths across original and paraphrased questions to derive the final answer.

Result: The PPCV framework is evaluated on multiple benchmarks with mainstream LLMs, showing significant improvements in reasoning performance over baseline models.

Conclusion: PPCV strengthens LLM reasoning by systematically identifying and refining crucial steps in reasoning paths, proving its efficacy through extensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of reasoning tasks. However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPCV substantially enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffuTruth, an unsupervised framework for fact verification using concepts from thermodynamics to detect factual stability and hallucinations in Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of hallucinations in Large Language Models, particularly when they provide confidently wrong assertions missed by typical uncertainty metrics.

Method: A novel approach using a discrete text diffusion model for fact verification, alongside new metrics such as Semantic Energy to measure factual stability and a Hybrid Calibration system to enhance model confidence.

Result: DiffuTruth achieves a state-of-the-art unsupervised AUROC of 0.725 on FEVER, outperforms baselines by 1.5%, and demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on the HOVER dataset with a 4% improvement.

Conclusion: DiffuTruth effectively detects and corrects overconfident and false outputs of LLMs, showcasing its robustness and generalization capabilities across datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate plausible but incorrect assertions, a vulnerability often missed by uncertainty metrics when models are confidently wrong. We propose DiffuTruth, an unsupervised framework that reconceptualizes fact verification via non equilibrium thermodynamics, positing that factual truths act as stable attractors on a generative manifold while hallucinations are unstable. We introduce the Generative Stress Test, claims are corrupted with noise and reconstructed using a discrete text diffusion model. We define Semantic Energy, a metric measuring the semantic divergence between the original claim and its reconstruction using an NLI critic. Unlike vector space errors, Semantic Energy isolates deep factual contradictions. We further propose a Hybrid Calibration fusing this stability signal with discriminative confidence. Extensive experiments on FEVER demonstrate DiffuTruth achieves a state of the art unsupervised AUROC of 0.725, outperforming baselines by 1.5 percent through the correction of overconfident predictions. Furthermore, we show superior zero shot generalization on the multi hop HOVER dataset, outperforming baselines by over 4 percent, confirming the robustness of thermodynamic truth properties to distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a tool for evaluating healthcare conversational agents by identifying errors, hallucinations, and risk patterns in diverse patient interactions.

Method: The simulator leverages the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and integrates medical, linguistic, and behavioral profiles derived from electronic health records, health literacy variations, and observed patient behaviors. The simulator was tested using an AI decision aid for antidepressant selection.

Result: The simulator generated 500 patient-AI conversations, revealing a decline in AI performance as patient health literacy decreased. Annotators and an AI judge showed high agreement in assessing medical concepts, confirming the simulator's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The simulator is an effective tool for assessing healthcare AI systems, with the potential to systematically identify performance weaknesses and risks among diverse patients.

Abstract: Objective: This paper introduces a patient simulator designed to enable scalable, automated evaluation of healthcare conversational agents. The simulator generates realistic, controllable patient interactions that systematically vary across medical, linguistic, and behavioral dimensions, allowing annotators and an independent AI judge to assess agent performance, identify hallucinations and inaccuracies, and characterize risk patterns across diverse patient populations. Methods: The simulator is grounded in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and integrates three profile components reflecting different dimensions of patient variation: (1) medical profiles constructed from electronic health records in the All of Us Research Program; (2) linguistic profiles modeling variation in health literacy and condition-specific communication patterns; and (3) behavioral profiles representing empirically observed interaction patterns, including cooperation, distraction, and adversarial engagement. We evaluated the simulator's effectiveness in identifying errors in an AI decision aid for antidepressant selection. Results: We generated 500 conversations between the patient simulator and the AI decision aid across systematic combinations of five linguistic and three behavioral profiles. Human annotators assessed 1,787 medical concepts across 100 conversations, achieving high agreement (F1=0.94, \k{appa}=0.73), and the LLM judge achieved comparable agreement with human annotators (F1=0.94, \k{appa}=0.78; paired bootstrap p=0.21). The simulator revealed a monotonic degradation in AI decision aid performance across the health literacy spectrum: rank-one concept retrieval accuracy increased from 47.9% for limited health literacy to 69.1% for functional and 81.6% for proficient.

### [117] [Gradients Must Earn Their Influence: Unifying SFT with Generalized Entropic Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11424)
*Zecheng Wang,Deyuan Liu,Chunshan Li,Yupeng Zhang,Zhengyun Zhao,Dianhui Chu,Bingning Wang,Dianbo Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Entropy Fine-Tuning (DEFT), a method that dynamically adjusts token-level weighting in supervised fine-tuning to balance stability and plasticity for improved model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in uniform token-level weighting during supervised fine-tuning, which can amplify noisy supervision and fail to sharpen model predictions effectively.

Method: The authors unify token-level fine-tuning objectives through a generalized deformed-log family and introduce a gating mechanism to manage prediction trust. Using the Cayley transform, they map prediction uncertainty onto a focus trajectory, combined with distribution concentration metrics like Rényi-2 entropy for dynamic modulation.

Result: DEFT demonstrates improved exploration-exploitation balance and achieves enhanced overall performance in extensive experiments and analyses.

Conclusion: Dynamic weighting using DEFT resolves the stability-plasticity dilemma and provides a robust fine-tuning approach for models, balancing trust and uncertainty effectively.

Abstract: Standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) applies uniform token-level weighting. This rigidity creates a two-fold failure mode: (i) overemphasizing low-probability targets can amplify gradients on noisy supervision and disrupt robust priors, and (ii) uniform weighting provides weak sharpening when the model is already confident. Existing methods fail to resolve the resulting plasticity--stability dilemma, often suppressing necessary learning signals alongside harmful ones. To address this issue, we unify token-level SFT objectives within a generalized deformed-log family and expose a universal gate $\times$ error gradient structure, where the gate controls how much the model trusts its current prediction. By employing the Cayley transform, we map the model's continuously evolving uncertainty onto a continuous focus trajectory, which enables seamless interpolation between scenarios involving uncertain novel concepts and those involving well-established knowledge. We then introduce Dynamic Entropy Fine-Tuning (DEFT), a parameter-free objective that modulates the trust gate using distribution concentration (Rényi-2 entropy) as a practical proxy for the model's predictive state. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DEFT achieves a better balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to improved overall performance.

*Muskaan Chopra,Lorenz Sparrenberg,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can detect critical machine translation (MT) errors, such as factual distortions and biased translations, and demonstrates their superiority over encoder-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reliability, fairness, and safety in multilingual systems by addressing critical MT errors that could lead to disinformation, miscommunication, and harm in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: Evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs across various adaptation strategies like zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning, using publicly available datasets, and comparing their performance to encoder-only baselines.

Result: The models showed consistent improvements in detecting MT errors, outperforming encoder-only baselines such as XLM-R and ModernBERT.

Conclusion: Error detection in MT is crucial for developing socially responsible multilingual AI systems, reducing risks associated with disinformation and linguistic harm, particularly in underrepresented contexts.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) plays a pivotal role in cross-lingual information access, public policy communication, and equitable knowledge dissemination. However, critical meaning errors, such as factual distortions, intent reversals, or biased translations, can undermine the reliability, fairness, and safety of multilingual systems. In this work, we explore the capacity of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect such critical errors, evaluating models across a range of parameters using the publicly accessible data sets. Our findings show that model scaling and adaptation strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) yield consistent improvements, outperforming encoder-only baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT. We argue that improving critical error detection in MT contributes to safer, more trustworthy, and socially accountable information systems by reducing the risk of disinformation, miscommunication, and linguistic harm, especially in high-stakes or underrepresented contexts. This work positions error detection not merely as a technical challenge, but as a necessary safeguard in the pursuit of just and responsible multilingual AI. The code will be made available at GitHub.

*Ahmadreza Jeddi,Marco Ciccone,Babak Taati*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoopFormer introduces a looped Transformer architecture adaptive to variable compute budgets, achieving robust and scalable reasoning in language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing looped Transformer models fix the number of loop iterations during training and inference, limiting their adaptability to variable compute budgets.

Method: The method involves training LoopFormer on variable-length trajectories using a shortcut-consistency scheme that ensures alignment across loops of different lengths. This conditioning allows for informative representations at shorter loops and refined representations at longer loops.

Result: LoopFormer achieves strong performance on language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating adaptability to compute constraints and scalability with additional computational resources.

Conclusion: Looped Transformers, specifically LoopFormer, show potential for adaptive and budget-aware language modeling, pushing forward controllable reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Looped Transformers have emerged as an efficient and powerful class of models for reasoning in the language domain. Recent studies show that these models achieve strong performance on algorithmic and reasoning tasks, suggesting that looped architectures possess an inductive bias toward latent reasoning. However, prior approaches fix the number of loop iterations during training and inference, leaving open the question of whether these models can flexibly adapt their computational depth under variable compute budgets. We introduce LoopFormer, a looped Transformer trained on variable-length trajectories to enable budget-conditioned reasoning. Our core contribution is a shortcut-consistency training scheme that aligns trajectories of different lengths, ensuring that shorter loops yield informative representations while longer loops continue to refine them. LoopFormer conditions each loop on the current time and step size, enabling representations to evolve consistently across trajectories of varying length rather than drifting or stagnating. Empirically, LoopFormer demonstrates robust performance on language modeling and reasoning benchmarks even under aggressive compute constraints, while scaling gracefully with additional budget. These results show that looped Transformers are inherently suited for adaptive language modeling, opening a path toward controllable and budget-aware large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADRD-Bench, a benchmark dataset to evaluate large language models (LLMs) specifically in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) contexts with unified clinical and caregiving assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs have minimal coverage of ADRD, creating a gap in rigorous assessment for healthcare applications.

Method: ADRD-Bench comprises two components: ADRD Unified QA (1,352 questions from seven medical benchmarks) and ADRD Caregiving QA (149 questions based on an evidence-based brain health program). 33 LLMs were evaluated on these components.

Result: Top-tier models achieved high accuracies (>0.9), but inconsistent reasoning and stability limit reliability, requiring domain-specific enhancements for caregiving contexts.

Conclusion: ADRD-Bench fills an evaluation gap, exposing limitations of LLMs in ADRD contexts and encouraging refinement of caregiving data-grounded knowledge and reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for healthcare applications. However, existing evaluation benchmarks provide minimal coverage of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). To address this gap, we introduce ADRD-Bench, the first ADRD-specific benchmark dataset designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. ADRD-Bench has two components: 1) ADRD Unified QA, a synthesis of 1,352 questions consolidated from seven established medical benchmarks, providing a unified assessment of clinical knowledge; and 2) ADRD Caregiving QA, a novel set of 149 questions derived from the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program, a widely used, evidence-based brain health management program. Guided by a program with national expertise in comprehensive ADRD care, this new set was designed to mitigate the lack of practical caregiving context in existing benchmarks. We evaluated 33 state-of-the-art LLMs on the proposed ADRD-Bench. Results showed that the accuracy of open-weight general models ranged from 0.63 to 0.93 (mean: 0.78; std: 0.09). The accuracy of open-weight medical models ranged from 0.48 to 0.93 (mean: 0.82; std: 0.13). The accuracy of closed-source general models ranged from 0.83 to 0.91 (mean: 0.89; std: 0.03). While top-tier models achieved high accuracies (>0.9), case studies revealed that inconsistent reasoning quality and stability limit their reliability, highlighting a critical need for domain-specific improvement to enhance LLMs' knowledge and reasoning grounded in daily caregiving data. The entire dataset is available at https://github.com/IIRL-ND/ADRD-Bench.

### [121] [When Audio-LLMs Don't Listen: A Cross-Linguistic Study of Modality Arbitration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11488)
*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech-enabled language models tend to favor text over audio when there is a conflict between the two. This dominance is largely due to the reasoning accessibility in handling competing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why speech-enabled language models tend to prioritize text over audio when audio and text inputs conflict, and to understand how this impacts model reliability across languages and models.

Method: The study used a benchmark called ALME, comprising 57,602 controlled audio-text conflict scenarios across 8 languages, to examine the behavior of models under these conflicts. Experiments involved fine-tuning, controlled manipulations, and evaluations on four state-of-the-art audio-LLMs.

Result: Models exhibited a significant text dominance in audio-text conflicts compared to text-text conflicts. Changes like transcription forcing increased text dominance, while reframing text as "deliberately corrupted" reduced it. Fine-tuning experiments localized the dominance to the language model's reasoning over the audio encoder.

Conclusion: Text dominance arises not from audio quality but from the model's accessibility in reasoning over modalities. Modality arbitration represents a new dimension of reliability in speech-language models.

Abstract: When audio and text conflict, speech-enabled language models follow the text 10 times more often than when arbitrating between two text sources, even when explicitly instructed to trust the audio. Using ALME, a benchmark of 57,602 controlled audio-text conflict stimuli across 8 languages, we find that Gemini 2.0 Flash exhibits 16.6\% text dominance under audio-text conflict versus 1.6\% under text-text conflict with identical reliability cues. This gap is not explained by audio quality: audio-only accuracy (97.2\%) exceeds cascade accuracy (93.9\%), indicating audio embeddings preserve more information than text transcripts. We propose that text dominance reflects an asymmetry not in information content but in arbitration accessibility: how easily the model can reason over competing representations.
  This framework explains otherwise puzzling findings. Forcing transcription before answering increases text dominance (19\% to 33\%), sacrificing audio's information advantage without improving accessibility. Framing text as ``deliberately corrupted'' reduces text dominance by 80\%. A fine-tuning ablation provides interventional evidence: training only the audio projection layer increases text dominance (+26.5\%), while LoRA on the language model halves it ($-$23.9\%), localizing text dominance to the LLM's reasoning rather than the audio encoder. Experiments across four state-of-the-art audio-LLMs and 8 languages show consistent trends with substantial cross-linguistic and cross-model variation, establishing modality arbitration as a distinct reliability dimension not captured by standard speech benchmarks.

*David Wan,Han Wang,Ziyang Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Hyunji Lee,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MuRGAt, a benchmark for assessing multimodal large language models' ability to provide grounded reasoning and citations across multiple modalities, showing significant challenges in achieving both reasoning accuracy and proper attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal grounding benchmarks fail to assess attribution in complex reasoning scenarios. This paper seeks to address limitations by introducing a reliable evaluation framework and benchmark.

Method: MuRGAt requires models to perform reasoning and provide precise citations across heterogeneous input sources, with an automatic evaluation framework correlating strongly with human judgments.

Result: Strong MLLMs struggle with accurate citation despite correct reasoning, revealing a trade-off between deeper reasoning and reliable attribution.

Conclusion: There is a gap between models' reasoning capabilities and their ability to generate verifiable grounded outputs, necessitating improvements in MLLMs for complex multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for real-world tasks involving multi-step reasoning and long-form generation, where reliability requires grounding model outputs in heterogeneous input sources and verifying individual factual claims. However, existing multimodal grounding benchmarks and evaluation methods focus on simplified, observation-based scenarios or limited modalities and fail to assess attribution in complex multimodal reasoning. We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning. Moreover, we observe a key trade-off: increasing reasoning depth or enforcing structured grounding often degrades accuracy, highlighting a significant gap between internal reasoning and verifiable attribution.

### [123] [Pretraining A Large Language Model using Distributed GPUs: A Memory-Efficient Decentralized Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11543)
*Jinrui Zhang,Chaodong Xiao,Aoqi Wu,Xindong Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPES, a framework for decentralized and memory-efficient training of mixture-of-experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs), drastically reducing memory requirements while matching performance with centralized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretraining large language models currently relies on centralized clusters with high-memory GPUs, which are resource-intensive and costly. Decentralized methods exist but still face memory limitations, creating a need for a more memory-efficient and decentralized solution.

Method: The SPES framework trains only a subset of experts per node, reducing memory usage. Nodes update local experts and synchronize selectively, avoiding transmission of full parameters. An expert-merging warm-up technique allows rapid foundational knowledge exchange early in training, enhancing convergence.

Result: SPES effectively trains a 2B-parameter MoE LLM using 16 standalone 48GB GPUs over internet connections, achieving comparable performance to centralized training. It also scales to train 7B and 9B models, matching centralized baseline performance.

Conclusion: SPES substantially reduces memory requirements while enabling competitive and scalable decentralized training of LLMs. This work demonstrates the broader capability of decentralized MoE LLM pretraining for scalability and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) typically requires centralized clusters with thousands of high-memory GPUs (e.g., H100/A100). Recent decentralized training methods reduce communication overhead by employing federated optimization; however, they still need to train the entire model on each node, remaining constrained by GPU memory limitations. In this work, we propose SParse Expert Synchronization (SPES), a memory-efficient decentralized framework for pretraining mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs. SPES trains only a subset of experts per node, substantially lowering the memory footprint. Each node updates its local experts and periodically synchronizes with other nodes, eliminating full-parameter transmission while ensuring efficient knowledge sharing. To accelerate convergence, we introduce an expert-merging warm-up strategy, where experts exchange knowledge early in training, to rapidly establish foundational capabilities. With SPES, we train a 2B-parameter MoE LLM using 16 standalone 48GB GPUs over internet connections, which achieves competitive performance with centrally trained LLMs under similar computational budgets. We further demonstrate scalability by training a 7B model from scratch and a 9B model upcycled from a dense checkpoint, both of which match prior centralized baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjr2000/SPES.

*Wenlin Zhong,Jinluan Yang,Yiquan Wu,Yi Liu,Jianhang Yao,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIGHT enhances multi-turn search reasoning in RL-powered LLMs by addressing Tunnel Vision with Self-Evidence Support (SES) and Information-Gain Driven Diverse Branching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the problem of redundancy and noise in search results during multi-turn autonomous question answering, which leads to irreversible errors termed 'Tunnel Vision.'

Method: SIGHT framework enhances reasoning via: 1) Self-Evidence Support (SES) to refine search results; 2) Information Gain score to identify crucial states and trigger dynamic interventions including adaptive branching and de-duplication.

Result: Experimental results reveal SIGHT's superior performance over existing approaches in single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks, achieving better reasoning capacity with fewer search steps.

Conclusion: SIGHT effectively addresses the limitations of RL-based multi-turn search by fostering high-fidelity evidence and uncertainty-driven exploration, delivering substantial improvements in complex search-based reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to master autonomous search for complex question answering. However, particularly within multi-turn search scenarios, this interaction introduces a critical challenge: search results often suffer from high redundancy and low signal-to-noise ratios. Consequently, agents easily fall into "Tunnel Vision," where the forced interpretation of early noisy retrievals leads to irreversible error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose SIGHT, a framework that enhances search-based reasoning through Self-Evidence Support (SES) and Information-Gain Driven Diverse Branching. SIGHT distills search results into high-fidelity evidence via SES and calculates an Information Gain score to pinpoint pivotal states where observations maximally reduce uncertainty. This score guides Dynamic Prompting Interventions - including de-duplication, reflection, or adaptive branching - to spawn new branches with SES. Finally, by integrating SES and correctness rewards via Group Relative Policy Optimization, SIGHT internalizes robust exploration strategies without external verifiers. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SIGHT significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex reasoning scenarios, using fewer search steps.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRIME, a benchmark for evaluating verifiers on alignment of derivation processes and outcomes in STEM problems, highlighting issues in current verification strategies and demonstrating improved results using a process-aware RLVR approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address flaws in current outcome-centric verification paradigms, which neglect errors in the derivation processes, leading to incorrect rewards for faulty reasoning despite correct final answers.

Method: They developed PRIME, a benchmark dataset of 2,530 high-difficulty STEM problems, and proposed a process-aware RLVR training paradigm leveraging verifiers selected via PRIME.

Result: The proposed approach improved performance in RLVR tasks with significant gains of 8.29%, 9.12%, and 7.31% on AIME24, AIME25, and Beyond-AIME problems, and showed a strong correlation (R² > 0.92) between verifier accuracy and RLVR training effectiveness.

Conclusion: PRIME successfully highlights flaws in existing verifiers and enables enhanced performance through process-aware training approaches, thereby proving to be a reliable benchmark for verifier selection.

Abstract: While model-based verifiers are essential for scaling Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), current outcome-centric verification paradigms primarily focus on the consistency between the final result and the ground truth, often neglecting potential errors in the derivation process. This leads to assigning positive rewards to correct answers produced from incorrect derivations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRIME, a benchmark for evaluating verifiers on Process-Outcome Alignment verification in Mathematics and Engineering. Curated from a comprehensive collection of college-level STEM problems, PRIME comprises 2,530 high-difficulty samples through a consistency-based filtering pipeline. Through extensive evaluation, we find that current verifiers frequently fail to detect derivation flaws. Furthermore, we propose a process-aware RLVR training paradigm utilizing verifiers selected via PRIME. This approach substantially outperforms the outcome-only verification baseline, achieving absolute performance gains of 8.29%, 9.12%, and 7.31% on AIME24, AIME25, and Beyond-AIME, respectively, for the Qwen3-14B-Base model. Finally, we demonstrate a strong linear correlation ($R^2 > 0.92$) between verifier accuracy on PRIME and RLVR training effectiveness, validating PRIME as a reliable predictor for verifier selection.

TL;DR: The paper addresses efficient personal knowledge organization in user memory for personalized applications, proposing the Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination (SAMD) method to handle selective filtering and adaptive memory standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve memory writing, management, and reading for personalized applications, addressing inefficiencies in organization and rising computational costs.

Method: Introduced Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination (SAMD) with two components: Gating Unit Module (GUM) for filtering non-essential data, and Cluster Prompting Module (CPM) for adaptive memory standards and clustering prompts based on user intents and memory contexts.

Result: Evaluation revealed SAMD effectively recalls relevant data, adapts to dynamic scenarios, and enhances memory quality and efficiency, offering superior performance in personalized applications.

Conclusion: SAMD enables robust and efficient personal knowledge organization, significantly improving memory discrimination tasks and personalized application functionality.

Abstract: Intelligent devices have become deeply integrated into everyday life, generating vast amounts of user interactions that form valuable personal knowledge. Efficient organization of this knowledge in user memory is essential for enabling personalized applications. However, current research on memory writing, management, and reading using large language models (LLMs) faces challenges in filtering irrelevant information and in dealing with rising computational costs. Inspired by the concept of selective attention in the human brain, we introduce a memory discrimination task. To address large-scale interactions and diverse memory standards in this task, we propose a Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination method (SAMD), which comprises two key components: the Gating Unit Module (GUM) and the Cluster Prompting Module (CPM). GUM enhances processing efficiency by filtering out non-memorable interactions and focusing on the salient content most relevant to application demands. CPM establishes adaptive memory standards, guiding LLMs to discern what information should be remembered or discarded. It also analyzes the relationship between user intents and memory contexts to build effective clustering prompts. Comprehensive direct and indirect evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. We independently assess the performance of memory discrimination, showing that SAMD successfully recalls the majority of memorable data and remains robust in dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, when integrated into personalized applications, SAMD significantly enhances both the efficiency and quality of memory construction, leading to better organization of personal knowledge.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of overthinking in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) and introduces a framework to enhance both efficiency and accuracy simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the latency and memory usage caused by excessively long reasoning traces in LRMs while preserving their accuracy and generalization abilities.

Method: The authors propose a dual-level framework called model that employs prefix-protected optimization for reasoning paths and difficulty-aware penalties for dynamic adjustments based on query complexity.

Result: Experiments reveal a significant reduction in token usage (up to 55.7%) and improvement in accuracy (up to 4.1%) on math benchmarks, with promising generalization performance in other domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances conciseness, accuracy, and generalization, addressing key limitations in reasoning models efficiently.

Abstract: Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by scaling test-time computation but often suffer from ``overthinking'', producing excessively long reasoning traces that increase latency and memory usage. Existing LRMs typically enforce conciseness with uniform length penalties, which over-compress crucial early deduction steps at the sequence level and indiscriminately penalize all queries at the group level. To solve these limitations, we propose \textbf{\model}, a dual-level framework for prefix-protected and difficulty-aware compression under hierarchical supervision. At the sequence level, prefix-protected optimization employs decaying mixed rollouts to maintain valid reasoning paths while promoting conciseness. At the group level, difficulty-aware penalty dynamically scales length constraints based on query complexity, maintaining exploration for harder questions while curbing redundancy on easier ones. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen (1.5B/7B) demonstrate that \model achieves a substantial reduction in token usage (up to \textbf{55.7\%}) while simultaneously improving accuracy (up to \textbf{4.1\%}) on math benchmarks, with generalization ability to code, science, and general domains.

TL;DR: This study explores the effectiveness of feedback generated by GPT-5 for biology multiple-choice questions, focusing on elements like tone and information coverage, and how feedback acceptance varies based on students' personality traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different feedback elements (tone, information, etc.) in LLM-generated feedback affect learning outcomes and acceptance, particularly when considering learners with diverse personality traits.

Method: Feedback for multiple-choice biology questions was generated using GPT-5, and a learning experiment was conducted with 321 high school students. Learning outcomes and subjective evaluations were analyzed alongside personality traits (Big Five).

Result: Effective feedback elements demonstrated common patterns that boost learning outcomes, while learners showed differing subjective preferences based on personality clusters.

Conclusion: Adapting feedback elements to align with learners' personality traits is crucial for designing effective and personalized LLM-generated feedback in education.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically generating feedback in education settings. However, it remains unclear how specific feedback elements, such as tone and information coverage, contribute to learning outcomes and learner acceptance, particularly across learners with different personality traits. In this study, we define six feedback elements and generate feedback for multiple-choice biology questions using GPT-5. We conduct a learning experiment with 321 first-year high school students and evaluate feedback effectiveness using two learning outcomes measures and subjective evaluations across six criteria. We further analyze differences in how feedback acceptance varies across learners based on Big Five personality traits. Our results show that effective feedback elements share common patterns supporting learning outcomes, while learners' subjective preferences differ across personality-based clusters. These findings highlight the importance of selecting and adapting feedback elements according to learners' personality traits when we design LLM-generated feedback, and provide practical implications for personalized feedback design in education.

Motivation: The fragmented approaches used to simulate patients hinder reproducibility, fair comparison, and standardized evaluation, necessitating a unified framework for patient simulation methods.

Method: PatientHub provides a standardized pipeline for defining, deploying, and evaluating simulated patients. Several existing and new simulation methods are integrated to demonstrate its extensibility and support for benchmarking.

Result: PatientHub successfully showcases standardized evaluation across methods and facilitates the integration of new simulation variants without infrastructure overhead.

Conclusion: PatientHub lowers the barriers to developing and benchmarking simulated patient methods, creating a practical foundation for advancing patient-centered dialogue research.

Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly power role-playing applications, simulating patients has become a valuable tool for training counselors and scaling therapeutic assessment.

In this paper, we introduce PatientHub, a unified and modular framework that standardizes the definition, composition, and deployment of simulated patients. To demonstrate PatientHub's utility, we implement several representative patient simulation methods as case studies, showcasing how our framework supports standardized cross-method evaluation and the seamless integration of custom evaluation metrics. We further demonstrate PatientHub's extensibility by prototyping two new simulator variants, highlighting how PatientHub accelerates method development by eliminating infrastructure overhead. By consolidating existing work into a single reproducible pipeline, PatientHub lowers the barrier to developing new simulation methods and facilitates cross-method and cross-model benchmarking. Our framework provides a practical foundation for future datasets, methods, and benchmarks in patient-centered dialogue, and the code is publicly available via https://github.com/Sahandfer/PatientHub.

Method: The study involved collecting sensicality judgments from human raters and LLMs on sentences presented with and without context across five semantically deviant datasets.

Result: Human raters classified most sentences as anomalous but not nonsensical, while LLMs demonstrated strong capability in generating plausible contexts for anomalous sentences.

Conclusion: Nonsensical sentences are rare, while LLMs are adept at contextualizing anomalous cases, showing promise for improving semantic interpretation models.

Abstract: Nonsensical and anomalous sentences have been instrumental in the development of computational models of semantic interpretation. A core challenge is to distinguish between what is merely anomalous (but can be interpreted given a supporting context) and what is truly nonsensical. However, it is unclear (a) how nonsensical, rather than merely anomalous, existing datasets are; and (b) how well LLMs can make this distinction. In this paper, we answer both questions by collecting sensicality judgments from human raters and LLMs on sentences from five semantically deviant datasets: both context-free and when providing a context. We find that raters consider most sentences at most anomalous, and only a few as properly nonsensical. We also show that LLMs are substantially skilled in generating plausible contexts for anomalous cases.

TL;DR: The paper addresses a precision paradox in visual reasoning tasks and introduces a method called Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a domain-specific language (DSL) for deterministic self-verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with complex reasoning tasks, lacking logical precision in visual perception and generation.

Method: TwD introduces an intermediate DSL, encouraging models to draft executable code representing logical reasoning rather than directly hallucinating answers.

Result: Experiments using the VisAlg benchmark demonstrate TwD's effectiveness as a cognitive scaffold for visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: TwD establishes a closed-loop system where visual generation validates logical reasoning, offering improved precision and generalizability in visual algebra and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Existing multimodal large language models have achieved high-fidelity visual perception and exploratory visual generation. However, a precision paradox persists in complex reasoning tasks: optical perception systems transcribe symbols without capturing logical topology, while pixel-based generative models produce visual artifacts lacking mathematical exactness. To bridge this gap, we propose that reasoning over visual inputs be reconceptualized as optical decompression-the process of reconstructing latent logical structures from compressed visual tokens. Guided by the axiom that Parsing is Reasoning, we introduce Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as a grounding intermediate representation. Unlike standard approaches that hallucinate answers directly, TwD forces the model to draft its mental model into executable code, rendering deterministic visual proofs for self-verification. To validate this, we present VisAlg, a visual algebra benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that TwD serve as a superior cognitive scaffold. Our work establishes a closed-loop system where visual generation acts not as a creative output but as a logical verifier, offering a generalizable path for visual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance test-time scaling by promoting in-context exploration during reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of facilitating in-context exploration during test-time scaling and mitigate the 'Shallow Exploration Trap.'

Method: Introduce Length-Incentivized Exploration, which combines a length-based reward and redundancy penalty to promote state coverage.

Result: The method shows average improvements of 4.4% on in-domain tasks and 2.7% on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: Length-Incentivized Exploration enhances reasoning capabilities by addressing bottlenecks in state coverage and improves performance across tasks and benchmarks.

Abstract: Achieving effective test-time scaling requires models to engage in In-Context Exploration -- the intrinsic ability to generate, verify, and refine multiple reasoning hypotheses within a single continuous context.
  Grounded in State Coverage theory, our analysis identifies a critical bottleneck to enabling this capability: while broader state coverage requires longer reasoning trajectories, the probability of sampling such sequences decays exponentially during autoregressive generation, a phenomenon we term the ``Shallow Exploration Trap''.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Length-Incentivized Exploration(\method).
  This simple yet effective recipe explicitly encourages models to explore more via a length-based reward coupled with a redundancy penalty, thereby maximizing state coverage in two-step manner.
  Comprehensive experiments across different models (Qwen3, Llama) demonstrate that \method effectively incentivize in-context exploration.
  As a result, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.4\% on in-domain tasks and a 2.7\% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid model, efficiently handles ultra-long context tasks by combining sparse and linear attention mechanisms, achieving superior performance at reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in handling ultra-long contexts due to the high computational and memory demands of the Transformer architecture.

Method: Developed MiniCPM-SALA, integrating sparse and linear attention in a 1:3 ratio using a layer selection algorithm and hybrid positional encoding (HyPE). Introduced a cost-effective continual training framework to transform pre-trained Transformers into hybrid models.

Result: The model achieved 3.5x inference speed compared to full-attention models on 256K token sequences, supported context lengths up to 1M tokens, and reduced training costs by 75%, maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: MiniCPM-SALA is a scalable and efficient solution for long-context tasks, offering high performance at significantly lower computational demands.

Abstract: The evolution of large language models (LLMs) towards applications with ultra-long contexts faces challenges posed by the high computational and memory costs of the Transformer architecture. While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints.

*Anne-Marie Lutgen,Alistair Plum,Christoph Purschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a subword embedding method to identify linguistic variations in raw text without normalization, applied on Luxembourgish comments to study dialectal and stylistic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine linguistic structure and patterns in spelling and morphology directly, treating variation as meaningful instead of noise, especially for small and multilingual languages.

Method: Train subword embeddings on raw text, combine cosine and n-gram similarity to group related forms, producing transparent clusters for analysis.

Result: Uncovered extensive lexical and orthographic variation in Luxembourgish aligned with dialectal research, highlighting systematic and regional differentiation.

Conclusion: The method offers reproducible means to study language variation using distributional models, valuable in noisy and low-resource language contexts.

Abstract: This paper presents an embedding-based approach to detecting variation without relying on prior normalisation or predefined variant lists. The method trains subword embeddings on raw text and groups related forms through combined cosine and n-gram similarity. This allows spelling and morphological diversity to be examined and analysed as linguistic structure rather than treated as noise. Using a large corpus of Luxembourgish user comments, the approach uncovers extensive lexical and orthographic variation that aligns with patterns described in dialectal and sociolinguistic research. The induced families capture systematic correspondences and highlight areas of regional and stylistic differentiation. The procedure does not strictly require manual annotation, but does produce transparent clusters that support both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results demonstrate that distributional modelling can reveal meaningful patterns of variation even in ''noisy'' or low-resource settings, offering a reproducible methodological framework for studying language variety in multilingual and small-language contexts.

*Tom Kempton,Julia Rozanova,Parameswaran Kamalaruban,Maeve Madigan,Karolina Wresilo,Yoann L. Launay,David Sutton,Stuart Burrell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DMAP is a statistical method for analyzing text using LLMs by mapping token probabilities into a unified representation, offering applications like generation validation, machine text detection, and forensic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current analysis of text using LLMs lacks context-sensitive interpretation of token probabilities, and existing metrics like perplexity are not sufficient for richer, model-independent text analysis.

Method: DMAP maps a text to a set of values in the unit interval based on rank and probability data from a language model. It is computationally efficient and widely applicable.

Result: Case studies demonstrated that DMAP could validate generation parameters, detect machine-generated text using probability curvature, and uncover statistical fingerprints in downstream models trained on synthetic data.

Conclusion: DMAP simplifies text analysis with LLMs, providing a mathematical framework that is versatile, efficient on consumer hardware, and opens paths for deeper research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful tool for statistical text analysis, with derived sequences of next-token probability distributions offering a wealth of information. Extracting this signal typically relies on metrics such as perplexity, which do not adequately account for context; how one should interpret a given next-token probability is dependent on the number of reasonable choices encoded by the shape of the conditional distribution. In this work, we present DMAP, a mathematically grounded method that maps a text, via a language model, to a set of samples in the unit interval that jointly encode rank and probability information. This representation enables efficient, model-agnostic analysis and supports a range of applications. We illustrate its utility through three case studies: (i) validation of generation parameters to ensure data integrity, (ii) examining the role of probability curvature in machine-generated text detection, and (iii) a forensic analysis revealing statistical fingerprints left in downstream models that have been subject to post-training on synthetic data. Our results demonstrate that DMAP offers a unified statistical view of text that is simple to compute on consumer hardware, widely applicable, and provides a foundation for further research into text analysis with LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RouterXBench, an evaluation framework focused on router ability, scenario alignment, and cross-domain robustness, and proposes a novel routing method, ProbeDirichlet, enhancing model performance in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable, cost-efficient, and privacy-preserving routing mechanisms for deploying smaller local models, complementing larger cloud-based LLMs, while addressing their evaluation limitations.

Method: The researchers develop RouterXBench, an evaluation framework capturing key router dimensions, and design ProbeDirichlet, leveraging Dirichlet distributions with probabilistic training to aggregate hidden states across layers for improved routing.

Result: ProbeDirichlet demonstrates significant improvement in router ability (16.68%) and performance in high-accuracy scenarios (18.86%), outperforming baselines consistently across model variations, tasks, and workflows.

Conclusion: RouterXBench and ProbeDirichlet provide robust routing solutions, advancing evaluation frameworks and enabling efficient local-global model collaboration in diverse use cases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved success, but cost and privacy constraints necessitate deploying smaller models locally while offloading complex queries to cloud-based models. Existing router evaluations are unsystematic, overlooking scenario-specific requirements and out-of-distribution robustness. We propose RouterXBench, a principled evaluation framework with three dimensions: router ability, scenario alignment, and cross-domain robustness. Unlike prior work that relies on output probabilities or external embeddings, we utilize internal hidden states that capture model uncertainty before answer generation. We introduce ProbeDirichlet, a lightweight router that aggregates cross-layer hidden states via learnable Dirichlet distributions with probabilistic training. Trained on multi-domain data, it generalizes robustly across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. Our results show ProbeDirichlet achieves 16.68% and 18.86% relative improvements over the best baselines in router ability and high-accuracy scenarios, with consistent performance across model families, model scales, heterogeneous tasks, and agentic workflows.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semi-automated method to extract structured knowledge from corporate financial reports and evaluates using novel proxy metrics. It employs automated ontologies and hybrid verification strategies to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate knowledge graph construction from corporate financial reports is hindered due to a lack of annotated ground truth for evaluation.

Method: A semi-automated pipeline for extracting Subject-Predicate-Object triplets using ontology-driven proxy metrics, comparing manually engineered vs fully automated ontologies across LLMs, and implementing hybrid strategies for verification.

Result: Automated ontology outperformed manual ones by achieving 100% schema conformance, and hybrid verification strategy reduced subject hallucination rate from 65.2% to 1.6%.

Conclusion: Ontology induction methods combined with hybrid verification yield superior accuracy and reduce subject-object hallucinations, improving financial report knowledge graph construction.

Abstract: Corporate financial reports are a valuable source of structured knowledge for Knowledge Graph construction, but the lack of annotated ground truth in this domain makes evaluation difficult. We present a semi-automated pipeline for Subject-Predicate-Object triplet extraction that uses ontology-driven proxy metrics, specifically Ontology Conformance and Faithfulness, instead of ground-truth-based evaluation. We compare a static, manually engineered ontology against a fully automated, document-specific ontology induction approach across different LLMs and two corporate annual reports. The automatically induced ontology achieves 100% schema conformance in all configurations, eliminating the ontology drift observed with the manual approach. We also propose a hybrid verification strategy that combines regex matching with an LLM-as-a-judge check, reducing apparent subject hallucination rates from 65.2% to 1.6% by filtering false positives caused by coreference resolution. Finally, we identify a systematic asymmetry between subject and object hallucinations, which we attribute to passive constructions and omitted agents in financial prose.

### [138] [Benchmark Illusion: Disagreement among LLMs and Its Scientific Consequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11898)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs with similar benchmark accuracy can exhibit discrepancies and disagreements, impacting scientific reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs' performance convergence masks underlying differences and their implications for scientific research.

Method: Analyzed disagreements in accuracy across LLMs on reasoning benchmarks and assessed their impact on model-dependent scientific outcomes.

Result: Found substantial disagreements across LLMs, leading to changes in treatment effects and reproducibility in scientific studies.

Conclusion: Benchmark accuracy alone can be misleading, with hidden disagreements among LLMs affecting research reliability and results.

Abstract: Benchmarks underpin how progress in large language models (LLMs) is measured and trusted. Yet our analyses reveal that apparent convergence in benchmark accuracy can conceal deep epistemic divergence. Using two major reasoning benchmarks - MMLU-Pro and GPQA - we show that LLMs achieving comparable accuracy still disagree on 16-66% of items, and 16-38% among top-performing frontier models. These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign. Together, these findings illustrate a benchmark illusion, where equal accuracy may conceal disagreement, with model choice becoming a hidden yet consequential variable for scientific reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaptEvolve optimizes the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning capability in evolutionary agent systems by dynamically selecting suitable LLMs based on intrinsic generation confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of efficiently selecting a capable large language model (LLM) during each generation step in an evolutionary refinement process to balance reasoning capability and computational efficiency.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive LLM selection framework called AdaptEvolve, which utilizes intrinsic generation confidence to estimate real-time task difficulty and dynamically select the appropriate LLM for evolutionary refinement.

Result: Experimentally, confidence-driven LLM selection reduces inference costs by 37.9% on average while achieving 97.5% accuracy compared to static, large-model baselines.

Conclusion: AdaptEvolve provides an effective and efficient approach to balancing computational cost and accuracy, leveraging real-time adaptation for multi-LLM frameworks in evolutionary agent systems.

Abstract: Evolutionary agentic systems intensify the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning capability by repeatedly invoking large language models (LLMs) during inference. This setting raises a central question: how can an agent dynamically select an LLM that is sufficiently capable for the current generation step while remaining computationally efficient? While model cascades offer a practical mechanism for balancing this trade-off, existing routing strategies typically rely on static heuristics or external controllers and do not explicitly account for model uncertainty. We introduce AdaptEvolve: Adaptive LLM Selection for Multi-LLM Evolutionary Refinement within an evolutionary sequential refinement framework that leverages intrinsic generation confidence to estimate real-time solvability. Empirical results show that confidence-driven selection yields a favourable Pareto frontier, reducing total inference cost by an average of 37.9% across benchmarks while retaining 97.5% of the upper-bound accuracy of static large-model baselines.

TL;DR: This paper highlights vulnerabilities in E2E speech translation models to adversarial attacks targeting inflectional morphology and proposes a novel framework called CMRT for improving robustness without costly adversarial speech data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E Speech Translation models lack robustness against non-native or dialectal speech variations, which is critical for real-world applications.

Method: The paper adapts text-based adversarial attacks to the speech domain and introduces Cross-Modal Robustness Transfer (CMRT) to transfer text-level adversarial robustness to speech models.

Result: Experiments across four language pairs show CMRT enhances adversarial robustness by over 3 BLEU points on average, proving efficacy without using adversarial speech data during training.

Conclusion: CMRT offers a scalable solution for improving E2E Speech Translation model robustness, addressing real-world challenges effectively.

Abstract: End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) has seen significant advancements, yet current models are primarily benchmarked on curated, "clean" datasets. This overlooks critical real-world challenges, such as morphological robustness to inflectional variations common in non-native or dialectal speech. In this work, we adapt a text-based adversarial attack targeting inflectional morphology to the speech domain and demonstrate that state-of-the-art E2E-ST models are highly vulnerable it. While adversarial training effectively mitigates such risks in text-based tasks, generating high-quality adversarial speech data remains computationally expensive and technically challenging. To address this, we propose Cross-Modal Robustness Transfer (CMRT), a framework that transfers adversarial robustness from the text modality to the speech modality. Our method eliminates the requirement for adversarial speech data during training. Extensive experiments across four language pairs demonstrate that CMRT improves adversarial robustness by an average of more than 3 BLEU points, establishing a new baseline for robust E2E-ST without the overhead of generating adversarial speech.

*Yunchong Huang,Gianni Barlacchi,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how question underspecification contributes to gaps in QA benchmark performance and how improving question clarity can enhance language model outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QA benchmarks remain unresolved despite LLM advances due to underspecified questions. The authors aim to assess the impact of underspecification on QA performance.

Method: An LLM-based classifier identifies underspecified questions in widely-used datasets. A controlled rewriting experiment evaluates the impact of specifying unclear questions on QA outcomes.

Result: 16% to over 50% of questions in QA benchmarks are underspecified, leading to poorer performance by LLMs. Rewriting to clarify questions significantly improves QA performance.

Conclusion: Underspecification is a key factor in QA challenges, indicating a need for clearer benchmark design to better evaluate and enhance LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on well-posed questions, yet standard question-answering (QA) benchmarks remain far from solved. We argue that this gap is partly due to underspecified questions - queries whose interpretation cannot be uniquely determined without additional context. To test this hypothesis, we introduce an LLM-based classifier to identify underspecified questions and apply it to several widely used QA datasets, finding that 16% to over 50% of benchmark questions are underspecified and that LLMs perform significantly worse on them. To isolate the effect of underspecification, we conduct a controlled rewriting experiment that serves as an upper-bound analysis, rewriting underspecified questions into fully specified variants while holding gold answers fixed. QA performance consistently improves under this setting, indicating that many apparent QA failures stem from question underspecification rather than model limitations. Our findings highlight underspecification as an important confound in QA evaluation and motivate greater attention to question clarity in benchmark design.

*Elisa Bassignana,Mike Zhang,Dirk Hovy,Amanda Cercas Curry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) adapt their linguistic style to different social contexts, particularly across socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Findings show LLMs minimally adjust to SES variations, often favoring upper SES styles, which risks perpetuating stereotypes and social stratification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate how LLMs mediate human-to-human communication in diverse social contexts and to understand their impact on perpetuating linguistic hierarchies and marginalizing certain communities.

Method: A new dataset stratified by SES was collected from Reddit and YouTube. Four LLMs were tested by prompting them with incomplete text from this dataset. Their completions were compared to the originals based on 94 sociolinguistic metrics, which included syntactic, rhetorical, and lexical features.

Result: LLMs show only minor adjustment to socio-economic linguistic variations and exhibit a tendency to mimic upper SES styles more proficiently. This results in approximations or caricatures rather than authentic style modulations.

Conclusion: The inability of LLMs to adapt to diverse SES linguistic norms can amplify existing social disparities. Their application in social research, simulations, or any context relying on language styles as social signals should be reassessed.

Abstract: Humans adjust their linguistic style to the audience they are addressing. However, the extent to which LLMs adapt to different social contexts is largely unknown. As these models increasingly mediate human-to-human communication, their failure to adapt to diverse styles can perpetuate stereotypes and marginalize communities whose linguistic norms are less closely mirrored by the models, thereby reinforcing social stratification. We study the extent to which LLMs integrate into social media communication across different socioeconomic status (SES) communities. We collect a novel dataset from Reddit and YouTube, stratified by SES. We prompt four LLMs with incomplete text from that corpus and compare the LLM-generated completions to the originals along 94 sociolinguistic metrics, including syntactic, rhetorical, and lexical features. LLMs modulate their style with respect to SES to only a minor extent, often resulting in approximation or caricature, and tend to emulate the style of upper SES more effectively. Our findings (1) show how LLMs risk amplifying linguistic hierarchies and (2) call into question their validity for agent-based social simulation, survey experiments, and any research relying on language style as a social signal.

Motivation: The study addresses the gap in multilingual diachronic corpora, which are essential for analyzing semantic changes in languages beyond a few high-resource ones.

Method: The datasets are derived from web-crawled HPLT data using crawl timestamps as proxies for document creation times. Resources include 1 million documents per language for three timeframes, alongside word embeddings and lexical substitutions.

Result: DHPLT offers a large-scale open collection of diachronic corpora, covering 41 languages with resources for semantic change study. The datasets provide significant experimental opportunities for researchers.

Conclusion: The development of DHPLT fills a critical gap in multilingual diachronic datasets, creating opportunities for expanded research in semantic modeling. The datasets and resources are openly shared for broader accessibility.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present DHPLT, an open collection of diachronic corpora in 41 diverse languages. DHPLT is based on the web-crawled HPLT datasets; we use web crawl timestamps as the approximate signal of document creation time. The collection covers three time periods: 2011-2015, 2020-2021 and 2024-present (1 million documents per time period for each language). We additionally provide pre-computed word type and token embeddings and lexical substitutions for our chosen target words, while at the same time leaving it open for the other researchers to come up with their own target words using the same datasets. DHPLT aims at filling in the current lack of multilingual diachronic corpora for semantic change modelling (beyond a dozen of high-resource languages). It opens the way for a variety of new experimental setups in this field.

TL;DR: The paper examines using large language models (LLMs) for simplifying cybersecurity texts, specifically CVE descriptions, and highlights challenges in preserving meaning despite simplification improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in understanding complex cybersecurity information and explore if LLMs can effectively simplify such texts for broader accessibility.

Method: The authors developed a baseline for text simplification in cybersecurity and conducted an evaluation using a dataset of 40 CVE descriptions, assessed by cybersecurity experts through two survey rounds.

Result: The study reveals that while LLMs improve text simplicity, they often fail to preserve the original meaning effectively.

Conclusion: Out-of-the-box LLMs have potential in text simplification for cybersecurity but require further development to ensure meaning preservation. Open data and code are provided for future work.

Abstract: Understanding cyber security is increasingly important for individuals and organizations. However, a lot of information related to cyber security can be difficult to understand to those not familiar with the topic. In this study, we focus on investigating how large language models (LLMs) could be utilized in automatic text simplification (ATS) of Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) descriptions. Automatic text simplification has been studied in several contexts, such as medical, scientific, and news texts, but it has not yet been studied to simplify texts in the rapidly changing and complex domain of cyber security. We created a baseline for cyber security ATS and a test dataset of 40 CVE descriptions, evaluated by two groups of cyber security experts in two survey rounds. We have found that while out-of-the box LLMs can make the text appear simpler, they struggle with meaning preservation.

Method: The paper introduces LaCy, which uses a spaCy grammar parser to help SLMs decide which tokens to learn and which tokens to delegate using the signal of acceptable tokens' loss.

Result: LaCy leads to higher factuality scores in cascading generation with larger models, outperforming other SLMs trained with alternative methods.

Conclusion: LaCy demonstrates an effective and cost-efficient strategy for improving SLMs’ ability to distinguish between learning and delegating, enhancing their factual generation capabilities when paired with larger models.

Abstract: Language models have consistently grown to compress more world knowledge into their parameters, but the knowledge that can be pretrained into them is upper-bounded by their parameter size. Especially the capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) is limited, leading to factually incorrect generations. This problem is often mitigated by giving the SLM access to an outside source: the ability to query a larger model, documents, or a database. Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \texttt{<CALL>} token. We find that this is not simply a question of loss: although the loss is predictive of whether a predicted token mismatches the ground-truth, some tokens are \emph{acceptable} in that they are truthful alternative continuations of a pretraining document, and should not trigger a \texttt{<CALL>} even if their loss is high. We find that a spaCy grammar parser can help augment the loss signal to decide which tokens the SLM should learn to delegate to prevent factual errors and which are safe to learn and predict even under high losses. We propose LaCy, a novel pretraining method based on this token selection philosophy. Our experiments demonstrate that LaCy models successfully learn which tokens to predict and where to delegate for help. This results in higher FactScores when generating in a cascade with a bigger model and outperforms Rho or LLM-judge trained SLMs, while being simpler and cheaper.

### [147] [Disentangling Ambiguity from Instability in Large Language Models: A Clinical Text-to-SQL Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12015)
*Angelo Ziletti,Leonardo D'Ambrosi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLUES, a framework for clinical Text-to-SQL that separates input ambiguity and model instability, enabling targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the two distinct causes of output diversity in clinical Text-to-SQL tasks: input ambiguity that requires clarification and model instability that necessitates human review.

Method: CLUES models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process, involving semantic interpretations and answers, and calculates an instability score using the Schur complement of a semantic graph matrix.

Result: CLUES improves failure prediction in multiple benchmarks compared to prior methods while offering a diagnostic decomposition unavailable from single scoring approaches.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently facilitates targeted interventions by mapping uncertainty regimes, enabling improved query refinement and model performance. High-ambiguity/high-instability scenarios allow focusing efforts on critical error cases.

Abstract: Deploying large language models for clinical Text-to-SQL requires distinguishing two qualitatively different causes of output diversity: (i) input ambiguity that should trigger clarification, and (ii) model instability that should trigger human review. We propose CLUES, a framework that models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process (interpretations --> answers) and decomposes semantic uncertainty into an ambiguity score and an instability score. The instability score is computed via the Schur complement of a bipartite semantic graph matrix. Across AmbigQA/SituatedQA (gold interpretations) and a clinical Text-to-SQL benchmark (known interpretations), CLUES improves failure prediction over state-of-the-art Kernel Language Entropy. In deployment settings, it remains competitive while providing a diagnostic decomposition unavailable from a single score. The resulting uncertainty regimes map to targeted interventions - query refinement for ambiguity, model improvement for instability. The high-ambiguity/high-instability regime contains 51% of errors while covering 25% of queries, enabling efficient triage.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Composition-RL introduces compositional prompts for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), aiming to enhance utilization of pass-rate-1 prompts and improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR struggles with uninformative examples in large-scale datasets and the prevalence of pass-rate-1 prompts during training, reducing effective data size.

Method: Composition-RL composes multiple problems into new verifiable questions, using these compositional prompts during RL training. It includes a curriculum variant that gradually increases compositional depth.

Result: Experiments across model sizes (4B-30B) show that Composition-RL improves reasoning capability and enables more effective cross-domain RL.

Conclusion: Composition-RL addresses the underutilization of pass-rate-1 prompts and improves RLVR performance with compositional and cross-domain prompts, offering a promising approach for more efficient training.

Abstract: Large-scale verifiable prompts underpin the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but they contain many uninformative examples and are costly to expand further. Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset. Performance can be further boosted with a curriculum variant of Composition-RL that gradually increases compositional depth over training. Additionally, Composition-RL enables more effective cross-domain RL by composing prompts drawn from different domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The abstract introduces DeepSight, an open-source toolkit aiming to improve the safety evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment of large models by integrating these processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety measures for large models, especially LLMs and MLLMs, rely on separate tools and cannot effectively identify internal root causes of risks or explain changes in mechanisms without affecting performance.

Method: DeepSight combines an evaluation toolkit (DeepSafe) and a diagnosis toolkit (DeepScan) to unify task and data protocols, enabling a transition from black-box to white-box insights into model safety evaluation and diagnosis.

Result: DeepSight provides a reproducible, scalable, and efficient toolkit, becoming the first solution to integrate evaluation and diagnosis in AI risk assessment.

Conclusion: This project systematically improves large model safety by unifying evaluation and diagnosis, transforming safety workflows, and addressing internal and external risks more comprehensively.

Abstract: As the development of Large Models (LMs) progresses rapidly, their safety is also a priority. In current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) safety workflow, evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment are often handled by separate tools. Specifically, safety evaluation can only locate external behavioral risks but cannot figure out internal root causes. Meanwhile, safety diagnosis often drifts from concrete risk scenarios and remains at the explainable level. In this way, safety alignment lack dedicated explanations of changes in internal mechanisms, potentially degrading general capabilities. To systematically address these issues, we propose an open-source project, namely DeepSight, to practice a new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. DeepSight is low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model safety evaluation project consisting of a evaluation toolkit DeepSafe and a diagnosis toolkit DeepScan. By unifying task and data protocols, we build a connection between the two stages and transform safety evaluation from black-box to white-box insight. Besides, DeepSight is the first open source toolkit that support the frontier AI risk evaluation and joint safety evaluation and diagnosis.

*Pinyi Zhang,Ting-En Lin,Yuchuan Wu,Jingyang Chen,Zongqi Wang,Hua Yang,Ze Xu,Fei Huang,Kai Zhang,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces P-GenRM, a personalized generative reward model, for improving the alignment of large language models to individual preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to accurately reflect diverse user preferences and struggle to generalize to new users with limited feedback.

Method: P-GenRM transforms user preferences into structured evaluation chains, utilizes adaptive personas, clusters similar users into User Prototypes, and implements dual-granularity scaling for individualized alignment.

Result: P-GenRM outperforms existing personalized models on benchmarks with a 2.31% average improvement and achieves strong generalization on unseen datasets. Test-time scaling adds a 3% boost.

Conclusion: The approach improves scalability and personalized alignment, addressing the challenges of preference generalization and adaptability to unseen users.

Abstract: Personalized alignment of large language models seeks to adapt responses to individual user preferences, typically via reinforcement learning. A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.

*Peter J Barclay*

TL;DR: The paper focuses on creating a rule-based morphological model for the low-resource Gaelic (Gaidhlig) language using Wiktionary data, emphasizing its utility in educational tools and linguistic resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of data required for training neural models for low-resource languages like Gaidhlig and to provide an interpretable, data-efficient solution.

Method: Utilizes SQL to analyze lexical patterns and create a declarative rule-based system in Python for generating inflected forms of Gaidhlig words.

Result: Developed a prototype rule-based morphological model that leverages Wiktionary data to derive inflected forms and support educational and linguistic tools.

Conclusion: Rule-based systems are effective for low-resource languages, leveraging small data sets like Wiktionary and offering interpretability and usefulness in educational and NLP contexts.

Abstract: Language models and software tools are essential to support the continuing vitality of lesser-used languages; however, currently popular neural models require considerable data for training, which normally is not available for such low-resource languages. This paper describes work-in-progress to construct a rule-based model of Gaidhlig morphology using data from Wiktionary, arguing that rule-based systems effectively leverage limited sample data, support greater interpretability, and provide insights useful in the design of teaching materials. The use of SQL for querying the occurrence of different lexical patterns is investigated, and a declarative rule-base is presented that allows Python utilities to derive inflected forms of Gaidhlig words. This functionality could be used to support educational tools that teach or explain language patterns, for example, or to support higher level tools such as rule-based dependency parsers. This approach adds value to the data already present in Wiktionary by adapting it to new use-cases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WavBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate conversational dialogue models for reasoning, colloquialisms, and paralinguistics, addressing current evaluation shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a benchmark that evaluates modern spoken dialogue models on real-world complexity, including audio characteristics like paralinguistics and colloquialisms, beyond traditional text-generation standards.

Method: Developed a benchmark, WavBench, featuring three subsets: Pro for challenging reasoning, Basic for colloquialism and rapport, and Acoustic for paralinguistic evaluation in real-world scenarios.

Result: Evaluated five state-of-the-art dialogue models using WavBench, providing insights into their capabilities in reasoning, colloquial delivery, and audio-centric fidelity.

Conclusion: WavBench fills the evaluation gap for modern spoken dialogue models, offering tools and standards to drive advancements in the field.

Abstract: With the rapid integration of advanced reasoning capabilities into spoken dialogue models, the field urgently demands benchmarks that transcend simple interactions to address real-world complexity. However, current evaluations predominantly adhere to text-generation standards, overlooking the unique audio-centric characteristics of paralinguistics and colloquialisms, alongside the cognitive depth required by modern agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce WavBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate realistic conversational abilities where prior works fall short. Uniquely, WavBench establishes a tripartite framework: 1) Pro subset, designed to rigorously challenge reasoning-enhanced models with significantly increased difficulty; 2) Basic subset, defining a novel standard for spoken colloquialism that prioritizes "listenability" through natural vocabulary, linguistic fluency, and interactive rapport, rather than rigid written accuracy; and 3) Acoustic subset, covering explicit understanding, generation, and implicit dialogue to rigorously evaluate comprehensive paralinguistic capabilities within authentic real-world scenarios. Through evaluating five state-of-the-art models, WavBench offers critical insights into the intersection of complex problem-solving, colloquial delivery, and paralinguistic fidelity, guiding the evolution of robust spoken dialogue models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CitiLink-Minutes, a dataset of annotated municipal meeting minutes in European Portuguese, addressing a gap in computational model development for such records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to tackle the lack of annotated datasets for municipal meeting minutes, which hinders advancements in IR and NLP applications for local governance records.

Method: They developed a multilayer dataset called CitiLink-Minutes, documenting 120 municipal meeting minutes across three annotation dimensions: metadata, discussion topics, and voting outcomes, with manual and expert curation.

Result: CitiLink-Minutes comprises over one million tokens and 38,000 individual annotations, offering baseline results for metadata extraction, topic classification, and vote labeling in NLP and IR tasks.

Conclusion: By releasing CitiLink-Minutes under FAIR principles, the study promotes computational research in local governance transparency and highlights the dataset's applicability for diverse IR and NLP tasks.

Abstract: City councils play a crucial role in local governance, directly influencing citizens' daily lives through decisions made during municipal meetings. These deliberations are formally documented in meeting minutes, which serve as official records of discussions, decisions, and voting outcomes. Despite their importance, municipal meeting records have received little attention in Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), largely due to the lack of annotated datasets, which ultimately limit the development of computational models. To address this gap, we introduce CitiLink-Minutes, a multilayer dataset of 120 European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes from six municipalities. Unlike prior annotated datasets of parliamentary or video records, CitiLink-Minutes provides multilayer annotations and structured linkage of official written minutes. The dataset contains over one million tokens, with all personal identifiers de-identified. Each minute was manually annotated by two trained annotators and curated by an experienced linguist across three complementary dimensions: (1) metadata, (2) subjects of discussion, and (3) voting outcomes, totaling over 38,000 individual annotations. Released under FAIR principles and accompanied by baseline results on metadata extraction, topic classification, and vote labeling, CitiLink-Minutes demonstrates its potential for downstream NLP and IR tasks, while promoting transparent access to municipal decisions.

*Sicheng Feng,Zigeng Chen,Xinyin Ma,Gongfan Fang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents dVoting, a fast voting technique for enhancing reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of autoregressive LLMs in parallel token generation limits their test-time scaling. While dLLMs allow token generation at arbitrary positions, leveraging their potential still requires improvement in reasoning capability.

Method: The paper proposes dVoting, which iteratively samples and refines predictions by identifying uncertain tokens, applying a voting-aware decoding process, and continuing until convergence.

Result: dVoting consistently enhances performance across benchmarks, achieving notable improvements: 6.22%-7.66% on GSM8K, 4.40%-7.20% on MATH500, 3.16%-14.84% on ARC-C, and 4.83%-5.74% on MMLU.

Conclusion: By exploiting dLLMs' parallel generation capability, dVoting offers improved reasoning with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating its efficacy across diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) represent a new paradigm beyond autoregressive modeling, offering competitive performance while naturally enabling a flexible decoding process. Specifically, dLLMs can generate tokens at arbitrary positions in parallel, endowing them with significant potential for parallel test-time scaling, which was previously constrained by severe inefficiency in autoregressive modeling. In this work, we introduce dVoting, a fast voting technique that boosts reasoning capability without training, with only an acceptable extra computational overhead. dVoting is motivated by the observation that, across multiple samples for the same prompt, token predictions remain largely consistent, whereas performance is determined by a small subset of tokens exhibiting cross-sample variability. Leveraging the arbitrary-position generation capability of dLLMs, dVoting performs iterative refinement by sampling, identifying uncertain tokens via consistency analysis, regenerating them through voting, and repeating this process until convergence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that dVoting consistently improves performance across various benchmarks. It achieves gains of 6.22%-7.66% on GSM8K, 4.40%-7.20% on MATH500, 3.16%-14.84% on ARC-C, and 4.83%-5.74% on MMLU. Our code is available at https://github.com/fscdc/dVoting

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new reranking framework leveraging attention scores from retrieval heads, achieving superior ranking performance across various domains and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for an efficient, lightweight, and effective relearning method to estimate passage-query relevance without requiring Likert-scale supervision.

Method: The method uses attention scores of selected retrieval heads in a listwise framework and trains models to produce continuous relevance scores, involving small-scale models and flexible extensions.

Result: The framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art rerankers across multiple domains, establishes new benchmarks, and demonstrates adaptability to extensions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is lightweight, effective, and versatile, providing strong performance and flexibility for improving reranking tasks across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Built upon the existing analysis of retrieval heads in large language models, we propose an alternative reranking framework that trains models to estimate passage-query relevance using the attention scores of selected heads. This approach provides a listwise solution that leverages holistic information within the entire candidate shortlist during ranking. At the same time, it naturally produces continuous relevance scores, enabling training on arbitrary retrieval datasets without requiring Likert-scale supervision. Our framework is lightweight and effective, requiring only small-scale models (e.g., 4B parameters) to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art pointwise and listwise rerankers across multiple domains, including Wikipedia and long narrative datasets. It further establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo benchmark that assesses the capabilities of dialogue understanding and memory usage. We further demonstrate that our framework supports flexible extensions. For example, augmenting candidate passages with contextual information further improves ranking accuracy, while training attention heads from middle layers enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Motivation: The motivation is to address AI's limitations in reasoning over spatial and relational structures, particularly in early-grade math, as current models struggle with visual problem-solving critical for classroom applications.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark consisting of 701 visual reasoning questions derived from primary school exams in Zambia and India. These questions cover tasks like reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching, using minimal-text images to mimic real-world conditions.

Result: Results show that while models perform well on static skills like counting and scaling, they struggle with dynamic spatial reasoning tasks such as folding, reflection, and rotation, highlighting a 'spatial ceiling.'

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that current AI models have limitations in visual reasoning, particularly for classroom settings. Education-specific benchmarks like VRB are crucial for identifying these weaknesses and guiding the development of more capable educational AI tools.

Abstract: AI models have achieved state-of-the-art results in textual reasoning; however, their ability to reason over spatial and relational structures remains a critical bottleneck -- particularly in early-grade maths, which relies heavily on visuals. This paper introduces the visual reasoning benchmark (VRB), a novel dataset designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to solve authentic visual problems from classrooms. This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions. Consequently, education-focused benchmarks like the VRB are essential for determining the functional boundaries of multimodal tools used in classrooms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well in document understanding tasks but lack comprehensive capabilities for fine-grained, structured extraction across diverse document types and schemas.

Method: The authors developed ExStrucTiny using a novel pipeline that combines manual and synthetic human-validated samples to create a comprehensive benchmark dataset. It unifies KEE, RE, and VQA aspects, covering diverse document types and extraction challenges.

Result: ExStrucTiny reveals challenges in schema adaptation, query under-specification, and answer localization, offering insights into open and closed VLM performance on structured IE.

Conclusion: This benchmark aims to pave the way for advancements in generalist models, improving structured IE capabilities across varying document scenarios and schemas.

Abstract: Enterprise documents, such as forms and reports, embed critical information for downstream applications like data archiving, automated workflows, and analytics. Although generalist Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on established document understanding benchmarks, their ability to conduct holistic, fine-grained structured extraction across diverse document types and flexible schemas is not well studied. Existing Key Entity Extraction (KEE), Relation Extraction (RE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets are limited by narrow entity ontologies, simple queries, or homogeneous document types, often overlooking the need for adaptable and structured extraction. To address these gaps, we introduce ExStrucTiny, a new benchmark dataset for structured Information Extraction (IE) from document images, unifying aspects of KEE, RE, and VQA. Built through a novel pipeline combining manual and synthetic human-validated samples, ExStrucTiny covers more varied document types and extraction scenarios. We analyze open and closed VLMs on this benchmark, highlighting challenges such as schema adaptation, query under-specification, and answer localization. We hope our work provides a bedrock for improving generalist models for structured IE in documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores compression in LLMs and develops methods for detecting when task-relevant information is lost due to token overflow during compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in processing long-context information within LLMs in resource-constrained environments, specifically focusing on the limits and consequences of token compression.

Method: The paper defines 'token overflow' and employs xRAG soft-compression settings to analyze when compressed tokens lose task-relevant content. Methods include saturation statistics and lightweight probing classifiers with query-aware contexts.

Result: Query-aware probing classifiers detect token overflow with an average AUC-ROC of 0.72 across datasets HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA. Query-agnostic methods were less effective for overflow detection.

Conclusion: Incorporating query information into diagnostics improves token overflow detection, enabling pragmatic, low-cost gating systems to reduce errors from compression in LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient long-context processing remains a crucial challenge for contemporary large language models (LLMs), especially in resource-constrained environments. Soft compression architectures promise to extend effective context length by replacing long token sequences with smaller sets of learned compressed tokens. Yet, the limits of compressibility -- and when compression begins to erase task-relevant content -- remain underexplored. In this paper, we define \emph{token overflow} as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it. In the xRAG soft-compression setting, we find that query-agnostic saturation statistics reliably separate compressed from uncompressed token representations, providing a practical tool for identifying compressed tokens but showing limited overflow detection capability. Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance. These results advance from query-independent diagnostics to query-aware detectors, enabling low-cost pre-LLM gating to mitigate compression-induced errors.

*Manjunath Kudlur,Evan King,James Wang,Pete Warden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Moonshine v2 is an ASR model using sliding-window self-attention for low-latency streaming while retaining high accuracy, achieving results competitive with larger full-attention models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) requires low latency and high accuracy for applications like live transcription and real-time translation. Traditional full-attention Transformer encoders, although accurate, suffer from high latency, especially for longer utterances.

Method: The Moonshine v2 model introduces sliding-window self-attention within an ergodic streaming-encoder to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while maintaining strong local context in ASR.

Result: Moonshine v2 achieves state-of-the-art word error rates across benchmarks, matching the accuracy of models six times its size, while being significantly faster.

Conclusion: Sliding-window self-attention can deliver high ASR accuracy with reduced latency and computational requirements, enabling efficient edge-device deployment for interactive speech interfaces.

Abstract: Latency-critical speech applications (e.g., live transcription, voice commands, and real-time translation) demand low time-to-first-token (TTFT) and high transcription accuracy, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices. Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent "encode-the-whole-utterance" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices.

Result: The curriculum was effective, but feedback emphasized the need for additional lecturer support and integration into broader teaching structures to optimize learning.

Conclusion: The curriculum has potential for fostering technical AI literacy in the L&T industry, but it should be bolstered with didactic support for better learning outcomes.

Abstract: This paper presents a technical curriculum on language-oriented artificial intelligence (AI) in the language and translation (L&T) industry. The curriculum aims to foster domain-specific technical AI literacy among stakeholders in the fields of translation and specialised communication by exposing them to the conceptual and technical/algorithmic foundations of modern language-oriented AI in an accessible way.

### [161] [T3D: Few-Step Diffusion Language Models via Trajectory Self-Distillation with Direct Discriminative Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12262)
*Tunyu Zhang,Xinxi Zhang,Ligong Han,Haizhou Shi,Xiaoxiao He,Zhuowei Li,Hao Wang,Kai Xu,Akash Srivastava,Hao Wang,Vladimir Pavlovic,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a trajectory self-distillation framework combined with Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO) to enhance few-step decoding in diffusion large language models, reducing the efficiency-quality trade-off. The proposed method outperforms baselines under minimal steps, though full-step decoding is still more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the potential for fast text generation with DLLMs, many refinement steps are typically required for quality outcomes, reducing efficiency. The paper aims to address this trade-off between efficiency and quality.

Method: The authors propose using a trajectory self-distillation framework that leverages the model's own generative trajectories. They integrate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a mode-seeking reverse-KL objective, to focus on high-probability teacher outputs.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing few-step decoding baselines and standard training approaches across various benchmarks while under tight step constraints.

Conclusion: The framework narrows the performance gap between few-step decoding and full-step decoding, providing a solid foundation for practical use of few-step DLLMs in applications with efficiency constraints.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Tyrion58/T3D.

*Tianzhu Ye,Li Dong,Xun Wu,Shaohan Huang,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OPCD introduces a new training framework for language models by leveraging their own trajectories and optimizing against a teacher model, enhancing accuracy and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable language models to better learn and internalize in-context transferable knowledge through a new training method.

Method: OPCD trains student models on trajectories they generate while targeting a teacher model with reverse KL divergence optimization.

Result: OPCD improved task accuracy across mathematical reasoning, text-based games, and domain-specific tasks, showing enhanced performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: OPCD effectively distills experiential knowledge and system prompt behaviors, supports cross-size distillation, and enhances model capabilities within and beyond distribution tasks.

Abstract: Context distillation enables language models to internalize in-context knowledge into their parameters. In our work, we propose On-Policy Context Distillation (OPCD), a framework that bridges on-policy distillation with context distillation by training a student model on its own generated trajectories while minimizing reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence against a context-conditioned teacher. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPCD on two important applications: experiential knowledge distillation, where models extract and consolidate transferable knowledge from their historical solution traces, and system prompt distillation, where models internalize beneficial behaviors encoded in optimized prompts. Across mathematical reasoning, text-based games, and domain-specific tasks, OPCD consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher task accuracy while better preserving out-of-distribution capabilities. We further show that OPCD enables effective cross-size distillation, where smaller student models can internalize experiential knowledge from larger teachers.

*Manuel Hetzel,Kerim Turacan,Hannes Reichert,Konrad Doll,Bernhard Sick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DD-MDN, a model for Human Trajectory Forecasting (HTF) that focuses on calibration, uncertainty modeling, and accuracy, addressing shortcomings in handling short observation periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HTF methods lack emphasis on uncertainty modeling, calibration, and robustness for short observation periods, which are vital for applications involving path planning and collision avoidance.

Method: The proposed DD-MDN model uses a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone combined with a dual mixture density network to predict trajectories. It learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths for diverse trajectory predictions without relying on predefined anchors.

Result: Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art accuracy, reliability in uncertainty estimation, and enhanced robustness during short observation intervals.

Conclusion: DD-MDN effectively combines high accuracy, reliable uncertainty modeling, and short observation robustness, making it suitable for critical downstream HTF tasks. The approach outperforms existing methods in the field.

Abstract: Human Trajectory Forecasting (HTF) predicts future human movements from past trajectories and environmental context, with applications in Autonomous Driving, Smart Surveillance, and Human-Robot Interaction. While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

*Yandan Yang,Shuang Zeng,Tong Lin,Xinyuan Chang,Dekang Qi,Junjin Xiao,Haoyun Liu,Ronghan Chen,Yuzhi Chen,Dongjie Huo,Feng Xiong,Xing Wei,Zhiheng Ma,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ABot-M0, a framework enabling general-purpose embodied intelligence across diverse robots by unifying data processing, training strategies, and proposing a novel learning approach called Action Manifold Learning (AML) for efficient and stable action prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address fragmentation in robotics data and training methods, creating a unified, systematic approach that enables better scalability and deployment of robotics intelligence across various hardware platforms.

Method: ABot-M0 builds a streamlined data pipeline (UniACT-dataset) combining six public datasets, using pre-training for generalization and leveraging a dual-stream modular perception setup. The paper proposes the Action Manifold Hypothesis and Action Manifold Learning (AML) for focusing prediction on low-dimensional feasible action spaces.

Result: The framework enables improved knowledge transfer, stability, and action prediction efficiency. Components function independently but provide additive improvements when combined, confirmed by experimental validation.

Conclusion: ABot-M0 advances robotics by offering a unified approach to data representation, model training, and efficient action learning, fostering progress in general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to classify tea leaf diseases using the teaLeafBD dataset with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tea leaf diseases manually is challenging, time-consuming, and error-prone, necessitating the development of an automated and efficient detection system.

Method: The study uses DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 for classification, integrates adversarial training for robustness, and employs Grad-CAM for explainability. Preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation are part of the pipeline based on the teaLeafBD dataset.

Result: EfficientNetB3 achieved a 93% classification accuracy, and DenseNet201 achieved 91%, demonstrating the model's capability to distinguish diseased from healthy tea leaves effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a robust and accurate solution for tea leaf disease detection, supporting advanced agricultural management in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Tea is a valuable asset for the economy of Bangladesh. So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.

*Jinghan He,Junfeng Fang,Feng Xiong,Zijun Yao,Fei Shen,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active-Zero introduces a new method for vision-language models to independently seek and learn from visual data, achieving better performance through active exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome current limitations in self-play for vision-language models that rely on passive interactions with static datasets, leading to inefficient learning and reliance on dataset quality.

Method: Active-Zero uses three co-evolving agents—a Searcher for finding tailored visual data, a Questioner for generating reasoning tasks, and a Solver for learning from tasks—forming a self-improving loop.

Result: Active-Zero improves performance, achieving 53.97 average accuracy in reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 in general understanding (3.9% improvement), surpassing existing self-play methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of active data exploration for enhancing learning and scalability in vision-language models, marking active exploration as essential for self-evolution.

Abstract: Self-play has enabled large language models to autonomously improve through self-generated challenges. However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines. These results highlight active exploration as a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReTracing is an artistic experiment exploring AI's impact on human and robot movement using generated choreographies and motion archive creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how AI shapes bodily movement and encodes socio-cultural biases through generative systems.

Method: Employing generative AI (LLMs and diffusion text-to-video model) to craft choreographies and utilizing multi-camera tracking to create a digital archive of movements.

Result: Produced choreographic guides for human and robot, created motion archives, and examined socio-cultural biases in generative systems.

Conclusion: ReTracing provides unique insights into human identity amidst moving, thinking AI systems and emphasizes the influence of generative technologies on human-machine interaction.

Abstract: We present ReTracing, a multi-agent embodied performance art that adopts an archaeological approach to examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement. Drawing from science-fiction novels, the project extracts sentences that describe human-machine interaction. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate paired prompts "what to do" and "what not to do" for each excerpt. A diffusion-based text-to-video model transforms these prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. Both agents enact the actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails, forming a digital archive of motion traces. Through this process, ReTracing serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. Through an immersive interplay of AI, human, and robot, ReTracing confronts a critical question of our time: What does it mean to be human among AIs that also move, think, and leave traces behind?

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the REVEAL benchmark to identify weaknesses in Video-Language Models (VidLMs), highlighting challenges in temporal reasoning, reliance on shortcuts, and robustness against occlusion that humans handle effortlessly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work seeks to address whether contemporary VidLMs robustly understand video content, temporal dynamics, and motion effectively.

Method: The authors design REVEAL, a diagnostic benchmark with five stress tests probing models' abilities on key tasks: temporal biases, language shortcuts, sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and handling spatiotemporal occlusion. A data pipeline was created to generate diagnostic examples automatically.

Result: Testing on various VidLMs revealed critical weaknesses such as confidently misinterpreting reversed videos, ignoring video content in question answering, failing to handle camera motion and occlusion, and agreeing with false claims – unlike humans who excel at these tasks.

Conclusion: The findings suggest significant limitations in VidLMs' capacity to understand video data and temporal relations. The authors aim to promote future advancements by releasing the REVEAL benchmark and associated tools for the research community.

Abstract: This work investigates a fundamental question: Do Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion? Our investigation shows that, surprisingly, they often do not. We introduce REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark that probes fundamental weaknesses of contemporary VidLMs through five controlled stress tests; assessing temporal expectation bias, reliance on language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and robustness to spatiotemporal occlusion. We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation. We will release our benchmark and code to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the largely qualitative comparisons in photogrammetry frameworks and enhance the generation of digital twins.

Method: A novel pipeline is developed leveraging synthetic images and programmatically generated camera poses for quantifiable experiments.

Result: Achieved systematic and quantifiable experiments by comparing ground-truth virtual camera parameters and objects with reconstructed estimations.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates repeatable and measurable research in 3D model generation and photogrammetry.

Abstract: The generation of 3D models from real-world objects has often been accomplished through photogrammetry, i.e., by taking 2D photos from a variety of perspectives and then triangulating matched point-based features to create a textured mesh. Many design choices exist within this framework for the generation of digital twins, and differences between such approaches are largely judged qualitatively. Here, we present and test a novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically generated camera poses. This enables a wide variety of repeatable, quantifiable experiments which can compare ground-truth knowledge of virtual camera parameters and of virtual objects against the reconstructed estimations of those perspectives and subjects.

*Ishan Mishra,Jiajie Li,Deepak Mishra,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SYNC loss, an innovative way to integrate selective prediction mechanisms into DNN training, achieving better performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selective prediction allows DNNs to decide when to predict or abstain based on uncertainty, vital for responsible usage in real-world scenarios.

Method: The SYNC loss combines ad-hoc and post-hoc selective prediction methods by incorporating softmax response into the training process to utilize selective prior effectively.

Result: The approach improves generalization and sets new benchmarks for selective prediction performance across datasets like CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars.

Conclusion: Utilizing selective prior during training enhances selective prediction capabilities, superior to traditional methods, marking a new state-of-the-art approach in the field.

Abstract: Prediction under uncertainty is a critical requirement for the deep neural network to succeed responsibly. This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) framework that integrates Vision Transformer-based depth estimation into VINS-Mono for enhanced performance in low-texture environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular VIO systems face difficulties in low-texture settings due to insufficient sparse visual features. Dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) shows potential but often requires high computational power, limiting real-time edge applications.

Method: The authors propose a framework that integrates learned depth priors into VINS-Mono. The method enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, filtering unstable artifacts using variance-based gating.

Result: Experiments on TartanGround and M3ED datasets show improved robustness and reduced divergence in challenging scenarios, achieving up to a 28.3% reduction in Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE).

Conclusion: The framework surpasses limitations of traditional VIO and complex foundational models by delivering accurate pose estimation with computational efficiency suitable for edge devices, especially in low-texture environments.

Abstract: Traditional monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems struggle in low-texture environments where sparse visual features are insufficient for accurate pose estimation. To address this, dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) has been widely explored as a complementary information source. While recent Vision Transformer (ViT) based complex foundational models offer dense, geometrically consistent depth, their computational demands typically preclude them from real-time edge deployment. Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale. Extensive experiments on the TartanGround and M3ED datasets demonstrate that our method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios and delivers significant accuracy gains, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%. Code will be made available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in real-time super-resolution have enabled higher-quality video streaming, yet existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of compressed video content. Commonly used datasets do not accurately reflect the characteristics of streaming media, limiting the relevance of current benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of identifying detailed discussions about artworks found in Art History articles.

Method: A new pipeline was created to collect an Art History articles corpus and adapt a CLIP model (named PaintingCLIP) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for domain specificity.

Result: The PaintingCLIP model, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms the original CLIP in providing rich contexts for artworks.

Conclusion: The ArtContext pipeline is effective and generalizable for annotating artworks and can also be applied to other disciplines.

Abstract: Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Forcing, a modification to latent diffusion models that enables them to operate directly on raw images, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings of latent diffusion models, particularly their inability to work end-to-end due to information loss during image encoding and reliance on auxiliary distributions and separate decoders.

Method: Latent Forcing restructures the denoising trajectory to jointly process latents and raw pixels using separate noise schedules, allowing latents to serve as intermediate computation scratchpads.

Result: Latent Forcing achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation on ImageNet at their compute scale.

Conclusion: Latent Forcing successfully combines the efficiency of latent diffusion with direct modeling on raw images, offering new insights on signal conditioning and tokenizer-diffusion relationships.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but lose the benefits of end-to-end modeling. They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using high-resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data to overcome limitations of short-axis cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) in cardiac shape analysis, employing a neural implicit function for better reconstruction of cardiac shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cardiac shape analysis using CMRI is hindered by its anisotropic nature, resulting in limited imaging resolution and complications in processing. There is a need for improved methods to analyze and reconstruct cardiac structures accurately.

Method: The authors rely on near-isotropic, higher resolution CTA data to train a neural implicit function, which jointly represents cardiac shapes from CMRI at different resolutions. The reconstructed shapes are evaluated using 4-chamber slice extractions for the right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO).

Result: Experiments show the method achieved high Dice similarity coefficients (0.91 for RV and 0.75 for MYO) and satisfactory Hausdorff distances, supporting accurate and anatomically plausible reconstructions.

Conclusion: The approach provides accurate, smooth, and anatomically plausible reconstructions of cardiac shapes, addressing limitations in CMRI-based analysis while demonstrating improvement potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: The anisotropic nature of short-axis (SAX) cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) limits cardiac shape analysis. To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative assessment demonstrate the model's ability to reconstruct accurate, smooth and anatomically plausible shapes, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis.

### [176] [Ctrl&Shift: High-Quality Geometry-Aware Object Manipulation in Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11440)
*Penghui Ruan,Bojia Zi,Xianbiao Qi,Youze Huang,Rong Xiao,Pichao Wang,Jiannong Cao,Yuhui Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ctrl&Shift, an innovative end-to-end diffusion framework for object manipulation in images/videos, achieving realistic and geometry-consistent transformations without explicit 3D modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for object manipulation often fail to balance background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. There’s a demand for a solution combining fine-grained geometric control with generalization, especially without requiring cumbersome 3D representations.

Method: Ctrl&Shift utilizes a two-stage approach, involving object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control. It employs a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy to disentangle background, identity, and pose signals. Additionally, the framework uses a scalable pipeline to construct datasets with paired images/videos and estimated camera poses.

Result: The proposed framework surpasses existing methods in terms of fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. Extensive experiments validate its capability of geometry-consistent object manipulation while maintaining a realistic scene.

Conclusion: Ctrl&Shift represents a significant advancement by unifying precise geometric control and effective real-world generalization in object manipulation tasks without depending on explicit 3D modeling.

Abstract: Object-level manipulation, relocating or reorienting objects in images or videos while preserving scene realism, is central to film post-production, AR, and creative editing. Yet existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces portable ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI methods to improve neuroimaging resolutions using novel correction and superresolution algorithms (DiffSR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of ULF neuroimaging, which suffers from poor resolution, noise issues, and artifacts in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

Method: The researchers developed a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence and introduced two algorithms: a Bayesian bias field correction with angular dependence and a CNN-based superresolution method (DiffSR).

Result: Through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, the algorithms demonstrated recovery of white matter structural details and improved neuroimaging reconstruction in ULF scans.

Conclusion: The algorithms enhance DTI performance by correcting artifacts and harmonizing sequences, enabling better neuroimaging at ULF. Public dissemination of the code supports research advancements.

Abstract: Portable, ultra-low-field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to expand access to neuroimaging but currently suffers from coarse spatial and angular resolutions and low signal-to-noise ratios. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sequence tailored to detect and reconstruct white matter tracts within the brain, is particularly prone to such imaging degradation due to inherent sequence design coupled with prolonged scan times. In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization. We release all code related to DiffSR for $\href{https://github.com/markolchanyi/DiffSR}{public \space use}$.

*Yun-Cheng Li,Sen Lei,Heng-Chao Li,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DBTANet, a method to improve semantic change detection in remote sensing images, addressing blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle limitations in semantic change detection methods, such as blurred object boundaries and insufficient temporal relationships in bi-temporal remote sensing images.

Method: Proposes DBTANet, a dual-branch framework using Siamese encoder with a SAM branch for global semantics/boundary priors and a ResNet34 branch for local spatial details. It adds a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) for capturing temporal dependencies and a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) for boundary-aware edge enhancement.

Result: DBTANet achieves state-of-the-art semantic change detection performance with enhanced boundary accuracy and temporal reasoning on public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DBTANet effectively combines global semantics, local details, and temporal and boundary features, solving existing challenges in semantic change detection for improved segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) aims to detect and categorize land-cover changes from bi-temporal remote sensing images. Existing methods often suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-Branch Framework for Semantic Change Detection with Boundary and Temporal Awareness, termed DBTANet. Specifically, we utilize a dual-branch Siamese encoder where a frozen SAM branch captures global semantic context and boundary priors, while a ResNet34 branch provides local spatial details, ensuring complementary feature representations. On this basis, we design a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture temporal dependencies in a symmetric manner. Furthermore, a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) refines shallow SAM features, suppressing noise while enhancing edge information for boundary-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that DBTANet effectively integrates global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### [179] [Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression via Next Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11494)
*Yufan Liu,Daoyuan Ren,Zhipeng Zhang,Wenyang Luo,Bing Li,Weiming Hu,Stephen Maybank*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression framework (ARFC) allowing any compression ratio with a single model, based on an auto-regressive approach with modules for improving quality. Experiments show it surpasses traditional methods and sometimes the original features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature compression methods lack flexibility and require retraining for new compression ratios, limiting efficiency in handling large-scale or multi-modal data.

Method: The proposed ARFC uses an auto-regressive approach via next-token prediction, coupled with the Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module and Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) for semantic and structural preservation.

Result: ARFC outperforms existing compression methods across various tasks and datasets, sometimes even achieving superior results compared to uncompressed features.

Conclusion: ARFC proves practical and versatile, offering an efficient, model-based solution for compression at arbitrary ratios and maintaining high-quality feature representations.

Abstract: Feature compression is increasingly important for improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, especially in applications involving large-scale or multi-modal data. While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address limitations in multimodal large language models, especially their reasoning capabilities in OV-HOI affected by cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity.

Method: ImagineAgent uses cognitive maps to model plausible entity-action relationships and employs tools like retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models for enriched visual understanding.

Result: It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets while using only about 20% of training data required by previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and improved performance in ambiguous multimodal reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have shown promising capabilities in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (OV-HOI) are limited by cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity. To address this, we propose \textbf{ImagineAgent}, an agentic framework that harmonizes cognitive reasoning with generative imagination for robust visual understanding. Specifically, our method innovatively constructs cognitive maps that explicitly model plausible relationships between detected entities and candidate actions. Subsequently, it dynamically invokes tools including retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models to gather domain-specific knowledge and enriched visual evidence, thereby achieving cross-modal alignment in ambiguous scenarios. Moreover, we propose a composite reward that balances prediction accuracy and tool efficiency. Evaluations on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance, requiring approximately 20\% of training data compared to existing methods, validating our robustness and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a new framework, VasoMIM, integrating anatomy-specific knowledge for X-ray angiogram analysis using self-supervised learning, addressing limitations of annotated data scarcity and introducing a large-scale dataset, XA-170K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of annotated data limits the application of deep learning for X-ray angiogram analysis, and self-supervised learning has untapped potential in addressing this challenge.

Method: Introduced VasoMIM framework consisting of two components: anatomy-guided masking strategy to learn vascular semantics and anatomical consistency loss to preserve structural integrity of vessels.

Result: VasoMIM demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks using the curated XA-170K dataset, showcasing superior transferability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This framework could serve as a foundational tool for advancing X-ray angiogram analysis tasks, enhancing accuracy and usability in this domain; both VasoMIM and XA-170K are publicly accessible.

Abstract: X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks. VasoMIM and XA-170K will be available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/XA-SSL.

*Yingkai Zhang,Shuang Chen,Ye Tian,Yunyi Gao,Jianyong Jiang,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MFdiff, a novel supervised-assisted diffusion model leveraging MR imaging and multi-modality feature fusion to restore high-quality PET images from low-dose scans while addressing challenges with data inconsistencies and out-of-distribution situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to reduce radiation exposure in PET imaging while maintaining image quality. Existing methods using MR images face issues with structural and texture mismatches during multi-modality fusion and difficulties handling out-of-distribution data.

Method: The authors propose MFdiff, which includes a multi-modality feature fusion module to enhance MR-PET fusion without introducing extraneous details. It uses a diffusion model conditioned on fused features and employs a two-stage supervised learning approach to incorporate both simulated in-distribution and in-vivo OOD priors.

Result: The experiments validate that MFdiff can restore high-quality PET images from low-dose PET scans and MR inputs, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative assessments.

Conclusion: MFdiff effectively addresses image quality degradation from low-dose PET scans by leveraging MR imaging, advanced feature fusion, and supervised learning to produce superior PET restorations, contributing towards safer and improved PET imaging practices.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Nam Nguyen,Thinh Nguyen,Bella Bose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses image denoising by introducing a generative compression framework to balance structural preservation and perceptual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distortion-driven techniques often lead to over-smoothed images, particularly under strong noise or distribution shifts, necessitating perceptually realistic denoising techniques.

Method: Proposes two approaches: a WGAN-based compression denoiser to control the RDP trade-off, and a diffusion-based iterative reconstruction with compressed latents. The framework uses entropy-coded latent representations and perceptual measures like LPIPS and Wasserstein distance.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real noisy datasets show notable perceptual improvements while sustaining competitive distortion performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively overcomes limitations of traditional methods, demonstrating strong perceptual outcomes and theoretical guarantees under Gaussian noise conditions.

Abstract: Image denoising aims to remove noise while preserving structural details and perceptual realism, yet distortion-driven methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift. This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance.

Motivation: To address challenges in generating ultra-high-resolution videos including motion modeling, semantic planning, and detail synthesis.

Method: LUVE employs a three-stage approach: low-resolution motion generation, video latent upsampling to reduce memory/computation, and high-resolution refinement using dual-frequency experts.

Result: LUVE achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity for ultra-high-resolution videos, validated through experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: LUVE effectively resolves challenges in UHR video generation with its innovative architecture, offering improved performance and validated results.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality, yet ultra-high-resolution (UHR) video generation remains a formidable challenge due to the compounded difficulties of motion modeling, semantic planning, and detail synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{LUVE}, a \textbf{L}atent-cascaded \textbf{U}HR \textbf{V}ideo generation framework built upon dual frequency \textbf{E}xperts. LUVE employs a three-stage architecture comprising low-resolution motion generation for motion-consistent latent synthesis, video latent upsampling that performs resolution upsampling directly in the latent space to mitigate memory and computational overhead, and high-resolution content refinement that integrates low-frequency and high-frequency experts to jointly enhance semantic coherence and fine-grained detail generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LUVE achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity in UHR video generation, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

TL;DR: The paper proposes FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework for fast domain adaptation in multi-agent Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptable and efficient deployment in diverse environments remains a challenge for Vehicle-to-Everything systems. Existing parameter-efficient methods struggle in multi-agent settings due to redundancy and degradation issues.

Method: The FlowAdapt framework leverages optimal transport theory to reduce information transport costs, using Wasserstein Greedy Sampling to filter redundant samples and a Progressive Knowledge Transfer module to maintain semantics in adaptation.

Result: FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance in domain adaptation with only 1% of trainable parameters, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and generalization across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlowAdapt provides an effective solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning in V2X collaborative perception, addressing redundancy and semantic erosion issues efficiently.

Abstract: Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an innovative framework integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for rapid and efficient disaster reconnaissance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of assessing structural damage after disasters by addressing limitations in traditional vision-based SHM, such as the need for human reorganization of discrete output data generated by AI systems.

Method: The study introduces the LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework, combining vision data, metadata, Deep Learning features, and LLM-generated prompts to produce detailed damage summary reports.

Result: The framework demonstrates a capability for rapid, automated generation of disaster reconnaissance reports, improving the effectiveness of post-disaster evaluations.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into SHM enhances disaster resilience by automating and summarizing structural damage assessments in an efficient and systematic manner, offering significant potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an effective approach for monitoring and assessing structural condition by analyzing image and video data. By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata. Results show that integrating LLMs into vision-based SHM, particularly for rapid post-disaster reconnaissance, demonstrates promising potential for improving resilience of the built environment through effective reconnaissance.

*Bin Huang,Xun Yu,Yikun Zhang,Yi Zhang,Yang Chen,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PLOT-CT, a method for low-dose CT reconstruction using pre-log Voronoi decomposition to enhance accuracy and reduce noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Typical low-dose CT methods suffer from amplified noise due to logarithmic transformation and cannot fully utilize structural information in pre-log measurements.

Method: PLOT-CT employs Voronoi decomposition in the pre-log domain to separate data into distinct components, which improves feature learning for better noise mitigation and information preservation.

Result: PLOT-CT achieves a 2.36dB PSNR improvement compared to traditional methods at a low photon level.

Conclusion: The novel pre-log domain approach significantly enhances reconstruction quality by addressing noise issues and better leveraging structural information.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.

TL;DR: The paper presents PLESS, a method to enhance pseudo-labels for weakly supervised segmentation using scribble annotations, improving performance in medical image segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing dense pixel-wise labeling costs for medical image segmentation using sparse scribble annotations while addressing the inherent noisiness and incompleteness of such supervision.

Method: Proposed PLESS, a pseudo-label enhancement strategy that refines labels using hierarchical spatially coherent regions. It is model-agnostic and integrates into existing methods.

Result: Experiments on cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements across four scribble-supervised algorithms.

Conclusion: The PLESS strategy enhances pseudo-label reliability and spatial consistency, improving segmentation accuracy in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScalSelect, an efficient method for selecting multimodal data for vision-language models (VLMs), offering competitive performance while using far less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training vision-language models (VLMs) on large-scale datasets is computationally intensive due to data redundancy, necessitating efficient data selection methods.

Method: ScalSelect is a training-free method with linear-time complexity that selects data by constructing instruction-relevant sample representations and identifying samples that best capture the dominant subspace of full dataset representations.

Result: ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of full training performance while using only 16% of the data, and sometimes even outperforms full-data training.

Conclusion: ScalSelect is an efficient, scalable solution for multimodal data selection that significantly reduces training costs without compromising, and sometimes improving, performance.

Abstract: Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

### [190] [Electrostatics-Inspired Surface Reconstruction (EISR): Recovering 3D Shapes as a Superposition of Poisson's PDE Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11642)
*Diego Patiño,Knut Peterson,Kostas Daniilidis,David K. Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for 3D shape surface reconstruction by using Poisson's equation instead of SDFs, leveraging its physics-based connections and using Green's functions for closed-form solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D shape surface reconstruction accuracy by addressing limitations of current SDF-based methodologies in capturing high-frequency details.

Method: The proposed method encodes surface reconstruction as a solution to Poisson's equation. It utilizes Green's functions to derive closed-form parametric solutions and superposes solutions to capture the target shape's implicit field.

Result: The method demonstrates enhanced performance in approximating high-frequency details, even with limited shape priors.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust and effective alternative for 3D reconstruction, outperforming traditional methods, particularly for scenarios requiring the preservation of intricate details.

Abstract: Implicit shape representation, such as SDFs, is a popular approach to recover the surface of a 3D shape as the level sets of a scalar field. Several methods approximate SDFs using machine learning strategies that exploit the knowledge that SDFs are solutions of the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDEs). In this work, we present a novel approach to surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to a proxy PDE, namely Poisson's equation. Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

*Ryan Deem,Garrett Goodman,Waqas Majeed,Md Abdullah Al Hafiz Khan,Michail S. Alexiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification using MRI data and evaluates various ResNet-based architectures against gradient-based adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of ensuring adversarial robustness in deep learning models for clinical applications involving brain MRI data.

Method: ResNet-based architectures (BrainNet, BrainNeXt, DilationNet) are tested against FGSM and PGD attacks across different preprocessing configurations of the MRI datasets.

Result: BrainNeXt models show superior robustness to black-box attacks, but reduced resilience to transferable attacks. Shrunk and non-augmented data increase adversarial vulnerability even when accuracy remains high.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness and classification performance must be jointly assessed to ensure reliable deployment of deep learning models in clinical brain MRI analysis.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification remains an underexplored yet critical challenge, particularly for clinical deployment scenarios involving MRI data. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis.

*Mengxiao Geng,Zijie Chen,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel GR-Diffusion framework that integrates geometric priors from 3D Gaussian representations with diffusion models to improve low-dose whole-body PET image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in PET reconstruction, such as noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss caused by sparse sampling and ill-posed inverse problems.

Method: The proposed GR-Diffusion framework combines 3D Gaussian representation with hierarchical guidance mechanisms for enhanced global consistency and local accuracy in PET image reconstruction.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GR-Diffusion outperforms current methods in improving 3D PET image quality and physiological detail preservation on UDPET and Clinical datasets.

Conclusion: GR-Diffusion successfully integrates geometric priors and generative diffusion models to advance PET image reconstruction, with implications for clinical imaging applications.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

*Seo Hyun Kim,Jin Bok Park,Do Yeon Koo,Ho Gun Park,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SToRM, a supervised token reduction framework for multi-modal large language models in autonomous driving, achieving efficient computation without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the computational demands of multi-modal large language models in autonomous driving systems while preserving performance during scenarios requiring human-vehicle interaction.

Method: SToRM uses a lightweight importance predictor, supervised training with pseudo-supervision, and anchor-context merging to reduce visual tokens while maintaining key information.

Result: Experiments on LangAuto validated that SToRM reduces computational costs by up to 30x, while outperforming other E2E driving MLLMs under reduced-token constraints with all-token-level performance.

Conclusion: SToRM offers a computationally efficient approach to end-to-end autonomous driving systems, making it viable for scenarios with limited resources while ensuring optimal performance.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance VR content creation by addressing limitations in capturing nuanced emotional semantics and fine-grained control in generative methods.

Method: EmoSpace utilizes hierarchical emotion representations, learnable prototypes, multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting for fine-grained control during generation.

Result: The EmoSpace framework outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, along with insights from a user study about emotional perception in VR versus desktop environments.

Conclusion: EmoSpace enables superior immersive visual content generation and supports innovative applications like therapy, storytelling, and artistic creation, with code and models being publicly available.

Abstract: Emotion is important for creating compelling virtual reality (VR) content. Although some generative methods have been applied to lower the barrier to creating emotionally rich content, they fail to capture the nuanced emotional semantics and the fine-grained control essential for immersive experiences. To address these limitations, we introduce EmoSpace, a novel framework for emotion-aware content generation that learns dynamic, interpretable emotion prototypes through vision-language alignment. We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels. We develop a controllable generation pipeline featuring multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting that supports diverse applications, including emotional image outpainting, stylized generation, and emotional panorama generation for VR environments. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of EmoSpace over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive user study investigating how VR environments affect emotional perception compared to desktop settings. Our work facilitates immersive visual content generation with fine-grained emotion control and supports applications like therapy, education, storytelling, artistic creation, and cultural preservation. Code and models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The study introduces Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation in cluttered environments, facilitating language-guided robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 3D instance segmentation for robotic manipulation in cluttered environments where perception is degraded by occlusions, noisy masks, and limited viewpoints.

Method: The paper proposed a hierarchical instance tree leveraging cross-view grouping and conditional substitution to suppress segmentation errors. It incorporates semantic embeddings for language-guided selection and a consistency-aware update for efficient scene adaptation during multi-stage tasks.

Result: Clutt3R-Seg outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios, achieving over 2x improvements in challenging settings.

Conclusion: The proposed Clutt3R-Seg method significantly improves 3D instance segmentation robustness and efficiency in challenging environments, paving the way for effective language-guided robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores neck-mounted gaze estimation using a novel dataset and transformer-based model, introducing new methodologies and yielding mixed performance results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored alternative viewpoint for gaze estimation through neck-mounted cameras and expand on limited prior work confined to head-mounted devices.

Method: The authors developed a new dataset of neck-mounted camera videos (4 hours from 8 participants), evaluated a transformer-based gaze estimation model, added an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task, and tested a multi-view co-learning approach using geometry-aware auxiliary loss.

Result: The gaze out-of-bound classification enhanced performance, while the multi-view co-learning approach did not provide noticeable benefits.

Conclusion: Neck-mounted gaze estimation has potential as an alternative viewpoint, with auxiliary tasks showing promise, but further study is needed to improve methodologies like co-learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation, a new task that estimates user gaze from the neck-mounted camera perspective. Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains. We further analyze these results and discuss implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.591 on key datasets, outperforming the baseline UNet with ResNet18 encoder, with fewer computational parameters.

Conclusion: TD-FusionUNet is effective and efficient for next-day wildfire prediction, suitable for real-time applications in environments with limited resources.

Abstract: We developed a lightweight and computationally efficient tool for next-day wildfire spread prediction using multimodal satellite data as input. The deep learning model, which we call Transform Domain Fusion UNet (TD-FusionUNet), incorporates trainable Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform layers that apply two-dimensional transforms, enabling the network to capture essential "frequency" components in orthogonalized latent spaces. Additionally, we introduce custom preprocessing techniques, including random margin cropping and a Gaussian mixture model, to enrich the representation of the sparse pre-fire masks and enhance the model's generalization capability. The TD-FusionUNet is evaluated on two datasets which are the Next-Day Wildfire Spread dataset released by Google Research in 2023, and WildfireSpreadTS dataset. Our proposed TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline using ResNet18 as the encoder reported in the WildfireSpreadTS dataset while using substantially fewer parameters. These results show that the proposed latent space fusion model balances accuracy and efficiency under a lightweight setting, making it suitable for real time wildfire prediction applications in resource limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current text-to-shape retrieval models in handling diverse object classes and arbitrary orientations within large-scale 3D asset repositories.

Method: RI-Mamba introduces a rotation-invariant model that disentangles pose from geometry using reference frames and Hilbert sorting for geometric structure. It includes a novel feature reintegration strategy via orientational embeddings and uses cross-modal contrastive learning to enable scalable training.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark, demonstrating superior robustness and representational capability over more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations.

Conclusion: RI-Mamba enhances the retrieval pipeline for 3D assets by combining rotation-invariant techniques with scalable learning strategies, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: 3D assets have rapidly expanded in quantity and diversity due to the growing popularity of virtual reality and gaming. As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/ndkhanh360/RI-Mamba.git.

*Qiwen Xu,David Rügamer,Holger Wenz,Johann Fontana,Nora Meggyeshazi,Andreas Bender,Máté E. Maros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes realistic cerebral DSA images based on anatomical and acquisition geometry control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The invasive nature and high cost of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) limit large-scale data collection and sharing, necessitating a method for generating realistic synthetic data.

Method: The authors designed a semantically controlled latent diffusion model (LDM) and trained it on a dataset of 99,349 DSA frames using text embeddings encoding anatomy and geometry.

Result: Generated images scored an average of 3.1 to 3.3 on a Likert scale by medical experts for clinical realism, with strong inter-rater reliability and a low Fréchet inception distance of 15.27 indicating similarity to real images.

Conclusion: Semantically controlled LDMs can generate realistic synthetic DSAs, enabling their use in algorithm development, research, and training.

Abstract: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, yet its invasive nature and high acquisition cost severely limit large-scale data collection and public data sharing. Therefore, we developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames under explicit control of anatomical circulation (anterior vs.\ posterior) and canonical C-arm positions. We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87). Distributional similarity to real DSA frames was supported by a low median Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 15.27. Our results indicate that semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing CT reconstruction methods, which suffer from artifacts in highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions.

Method: TG-Field employs a multi-resolution hash encoder for local spatial priors, uses time-conditioned representations with spatiotemporal attention blocks for dynamic reconstruction, and integrates a motion-flow network for tracking respiratory motion.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate TG-Field's superior reconstruction accuracy compared to existing methods, especially in sparse-view cases.

Conclusion: TG-Field effectively tackles challenges in static and dynamic CT reconstruction, offering state-of-the-art results under challenging conditions such as sparse-view projections and dynamic motions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene representation with superior efficiency and quality. While recent adaptations for computed tomography (CT) show promise, they struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose Tomographic Geometry Field (TG-Field), a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework tailored for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence. In addition, a motion-flow network models fine-grained respiratory motion to track local anatomical deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

A pipeline was developed for agricultural simulations, resulting in enhanced performance and time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design in existing LLM-driven 3D scene generation techniques.

Method: The authors developed a modular multi-LLM pipeline, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge, and Unreal Engine code generation. Techniques like few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation were utilized for optimization.

Result: The system successfully created realistic agricultural 3D environments based on natural language prompts. Evaluation showed improved semantic accuracy, faster scene design, and better realism compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Multi-LLM pipelines are effective for domain-specific 3D scene generation, offering better scalability, reliability, and precision. Future work aims to expand the system to other domains and improve real-time generation capabilities.

Abstract: Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

TL;DR: GSO-SLAM is a real-time monocular dense SLAM system using Gaussian scene representation to optimize both tracking and mapping with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM methods suffer from either high computational costs due to unified scene coupling or redundancies from loosely integrated components. There is a need for a method that efficiently integrates tracking and mapping.

Method: The method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry and Gaussian Splatting within an Expectation-Maximization framework, optimizing depth and scene representation simultaneously. Gaussian Splat Initialization is introduced to avoid heuristics by leveraging VO data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate real-time performance with state-of-the-art accuracy in reconstructed scene fidelity and tracking.

Conclusion: The proposed GSO-SLAM achieves efficient and accurate SLAM, bridging the gap between robust tracking and high-quality mapping in real-time scenarios.

Abstract: We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the hallucination issues in vision-language models (VLMs) for dense prediction tasks by proposing a visual prompting paradigm and the STVG-R1 reinforcement learning framework, achieving significant improvements in performance on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle misalignments between textual descriptions and visual coordinates in dense prediction tasks like spatial-temporal video grounding, which causes hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs).

Method: The authors introduce a unique visual prompting paradigm by assigning temporally consistent IDs to objects and embedding them into videos as visual prompts. They also propose STVG-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization.

Result: Experiments show a 20.9% improvement in m_IoU over the baseline on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, setting a new state of the art. STVG-R1 also demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot generalization to related tasks, achieving SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer an efficient and annotation-free alternative to traditional VLM approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across tasks.

Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

Motivation: E-commerce demands robust multimodal comprehension to process text, images, and structured attributes. Current VLMs lack adaptation strategies for attribute-centric and noisy e-commerce data.

Method: The paper conducts a large-scale experimental study to adapt general Vision-Language Models to fit the unique needs of e-commerce while retaining their general multimodal capabilities.

Result: Targeted adaptation of VLMs significantly improves e-commerce-related tasks and preserves the models' versatility across multimodal data.

Conclusion: This work introduces a strategy for adapting VLMs to e-commerce and proposes an evaluation suite to advance product understanding, instruction following, and attribute extraction.

Abstract: E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

*Boqi Chen,Xudong Liu,Jianing Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies and improves visual contrastive decoding (VCD) to address object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by introducing an object-aligned auxiliary view using Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address object hallucination in MLLMs, which occurs when models fail to accurately link textual descriptions with visual inputs, potentially hindering their reliability.

Method: Introduce an object-aligned auxiliary view by leveraging object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. Most salient visual elements are removed to form an auxiliary view for stronger contrast signals, ensuring alignment with VCD. This approach is prompt and model-agnostic, and lightweight.

Result: Achieved consistent performance improvements across two object hallucination benchmarks and with two Multimodal Large Language Models.

Conclusion: The new method enhances the ability of VCD to handle object hallucination in MLLMs effectively, improving model accuracy with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass. Empirically, our method demonstrates consistent gains on two popular object hallucination benchmarks across two MLLMs.

### [206] [JEPA-VLA: Video Predictive Embedding is Needed for VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11832)
*Shangchen Miao,Ningya Feng,Jialong Wu,Ye Lin,Xu He,Dong Li,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces JEPA-VLA, improving vision-language-action models for robotic tasks by integrating predictive visual embeddings to address limitations in existing visual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs face challenges like low sample efficiency and limited generalization, which authors believe are caused by inadequate pretrained visual representations that fail to capture task-relevant information or provide policy priors.

Method: The authors propose JEPA-VLA, a method that integrates predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, specifically V-JEPA 2, into VLAs to enhance environment understanding and policy prior knowledge.

Result: JEPA-VLA demonstrated significant performance improvements on benchmarks like LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating predictive video embeddings into VLAs offers a simple yet effective enhancement to address limitations in environment understanding and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

*Xiangyu Wu,Dongming Jiang,Feng Yu,Yueying Tian,Jiaqi Tang,Qing-Guo Chen,Yang Yang,Jianfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE), a method for improving test-time adaptation of CLIP by addressing biases using generalized entropy measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bias in Shannon Entropy used for Test-Time Adaptation in vision-language models like CLIP, caused by imbalanced pretraining datasets.

Method: Utilizes Tsallis Entropy (TE) and extends it into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) with adaptive class-specific parameters to refine model predictions and enhance adaptation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ADTE surpasses state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet, its variants, and cross-domain benchmarks, achieving improved adaptation performance.

Conclusion: ADTE provides a robust alternate to Shannon Entropy for unbiased and efficient Test-Time Adaptation, without requiring additional hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Mainstream Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for adapting vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, typically rely on Shannon Entropy (SE) at test time to measure prediction uncertainty and inconsistency. However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DiffPlace, a framework for generating place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes using multi-view diffusion models to enhance place recognition in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view diffusion models struggle to generate place-aware urban scenes with background consistency, limiting their effectiveness in place recognition tasks and related applications.

Method: The authors introduce a place-ID controller utilizing linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning. This controller maps place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, enabling consistent background generation while allowing flexible adjustments to foreground objects and conditions.

Result: DiffPlace surpasses existing methods in generation quality and its utility in augmented training for place recognition tasks. Quantitative evaluations and training assessments confirm its superiority.

Conclusion: DiffPlace introduces a novel approach to place-controllable multi-view image generation, highlighting its significance for autonomous driving and visual place recognition improvements.

Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in realistic image synthesis, with diffusion models excelling in quality and stability. Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving

TL;DR: Introduces Code2Worlds, a framework for 4D dynamics generation grounded in physical laws, using language-to-simulation code generation and dual-stream architecture with physics-aware mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for realistic 4D dynamics generation, moving beyond visual plausibility to simulators grounded in physical laws for spatial intelligence.

Method: Uses a dual-stream architecture for disentangling object/environment generation and physics-aware closed-loop mechanisms for dynamic fidelity, incorporating self-reflective refinement.

Result: Code2Worlds achieves 41% improvement in Generation Score (SGS) and 49% higher richness, while successfully generating physics-aware dynamics.

Conclusion: Code2Worlds surpasses baseline methods in 4D dynamics generation by combining structured object/environment design with physics-aware adjustments.

Abstract: Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in 4D relighting due to limited paired training data and maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints.

Method: Introduced Disentangled Flow Guidance for lighting control and Temporal Consistent Attention in IC-Light architecture with deterministic regularization to reduce flickering.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive performance in maintaining temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, handling camera rotations from -90 to 90 degrees.

Conclusion: Light4D demonstrates robust capabilities in synthesis of temporally consistent 4D videos under diverse viewpoints and designated illumination, overcoming significant challenges.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight RGB-D fusion model improving segmentation using depth maps and a smaller training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce dependency on large datasets and leverage depth information for better segmentation.

Method: The model fuses monocular depth maps with RGB mid-level features using a depth encoder and trains on a smaller dataset.

Result: The method outperforms EfficientViT-SAM in segmentation accuracy with a significantly reduced training dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating depth information with RGB data provides strong geometric priors, enhancing segmentation performance while reducing data requirements.

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) achieve impressive universal segmentation performance but require massive datasets (e.g., 11M images) and rely solely on RGB inputs. Recent efficient variants reduce computation but still depend on large-scale training. We propose a lightweight RGB-D fusion framework that augments EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors. Depth maps are generated with a pretrained estimator and fused mid-level with RGB features through a dedicated depth encoder. Trained on only 11.2k samples (less than 0.1\% of SA-1B), our method achieves higher accuracy than EfficientViT-SAM, showing that depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper explores generating synthetic 3D fractal videos using Iterated Function Systems for pre-training action recognition models, proposing a novel method called Targeted Smart Filtering for efficient fractal generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of labeled real datasets such as manual labor, privacy, and ethical issues by using synthetic datasets generated through Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL).

Method: The paper systematically explores generating 3D fractals using Iterated Function Systems, transforming them into videos for pre-training action recognition tasks. It proposes a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to improve generation speed and fractal diversity.

Result: Targeted Smart Filtering achieves approximately 100 times faster sampling speed and leads to superior downstream performance compared to other 3D fractal filtering techniques.

Conclusion: Synthetic 3D fractals generated and filtered using Targeted Smart Filtering are effective for pre-training action recognition models, addressing issues of speed and data diversity.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are being recognized in the deep learning realm as a valuable alternative to exhaustively labeled real data. One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for better monocular input-based dynamic reconstruction frameworks, as current methods face challenges in holistic temporal optimization and coupled spatial hierarchy.

Method: WorldTree introduces Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) for coarse-to-fine temporal optimization using a hierarchical structure and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) for complementary spatial dynamics focused on ancestral nodes.

Result: WorldTree demonstrates significant performance improvements: 8.26% increase in LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% increase in mLPIPS on DyCheck datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed WorldTree framework successfully enhances monocular dynamic reconstruction by bridging spatiotemporal decomposition challenges, showcasing improved results validated through experiments.

Abstract: Dynamic reconstruction has achieved remarkable progress, but there remain challenges in monocular input for more practical applications. The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves 8.26% improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

*Chenru Wang,Beier Zhu,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI) and mimic-CFG methods to improve rectified-flow-based generative models by enhancing inversion stability, image reconstruction, and editing quality without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rectified-flow models encounter instability and approximation errors during inversion, leading to reduced performance in tasks like image reconstruction and editing.

Method: The paper introduces PMI, a gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field using a running average of past velocities bounded by a spherical Gaussian. It also proposes mimic-CFG, a velocity correction scheme designed for editing tasks.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed methods significantly enhance the stability, reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity of rectified-flow models while reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques establish a new benchmark on PIE-Bench, achieving state-of-the-art performance with robust theoretical foundations and improved efficiency.

Abstract: Rectified-Flow (RF)-based generative models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to traditional diffusion models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

### [215] [Zooming without Zooming: Region-to-Image Distillation for Fine-Grained Multimodal Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11858)
*Lai Wei,Liangbo He,Jun Lan,Lingzhong Dong,Yutong Cai,Siyuan Li,Huijia Zhu,Weiqiang Wang,Linghe Kong,Yue Wang,Zhuosheng Zhang,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to train Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for fine-grained visual perception using Region-to-Image Distillation, which improves performance without iterative zooming by leveraging zoomed-in data during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception as crucial details are often overshadowed by broader visual context. Current methods for this involve multiple inference-time zooming steps, which are inefficient due to high latency.

Method: Region-to-Image Distillation internalizes the benefits of zooming into training by using high-quality supervision from zoomed-in regions generated by strong teacher models, which is then taught to student models. This eliminates the need for inference-time zooming.

Result: The proposed approach achieves better fine-grained perception and general multimodal cognition, validated through performance in ZoomBench and other benchmarks like visual reasoning and GUI agents.

Conclusion: Region-to-Image Distillation effectively reduces latency while improving fine-grained perception, enhancing MLLM capabilities without requiring inference-time zooming. The study provides insights into when zooming is beneficial in training versus inference.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass. Our code is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/Zooming-without-Zooming.

*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unrolled network approach to mitigate CT ring artifacts, leveraging synthetic data and intrinsic correlations between sinogram and image domains to outperform current methods without relying on clinical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ring and streak artifacts in CT images caused by defective detector responses, which compromise clinical utility and involve high data collection costs in existing supervised deep learning approaches.

Method: The paper formulates the ring artifact reduction as an inverse problem using an unrolled network. This network integrates non-ideal detector responses with linear forward-projection of CT geometry. It utilizes synthetic data derived from natural images to avoid reliance on real-world datasets.

Result: The trained model demonstrates superior performance across varied CT geometries and anatomical regions, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods even with reliance solely on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data and an unrolled network leveraging intrinsic sinogram-image correlations enable effective artifact correction, suggesting a more cost-efficient and robust solution to CT imaging artifacts.

Abstract: Defective and inconsistent responses in CT detectors can cause ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them unusable for clinical purposes. In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: A baseline model called ObAct, which uses spatiotemporal attention, was provided and showed an 8.1% improvement in location success rate.

Conclusion: The DynaHOI-Gym platform and DynaHOI-10M dataset provide critical tools to analyze and improve hand motion in dynamic scenarios with moving targets.

Abstract: Most existing hand motion generation benchmarks for hand-object interaction (HOI) focus on static objects, leaving dynamic scenarios with moving targets and time-critical coordination largely untested. To address this gap, we introduce the DynaHOI-Gym, a unified online closed-loop platform with parameterized motion generators and rollout-based metrics for dynamic capture evaluation. Built on DynaHOI-Gym, we release DynaHOI-10M, a large-scale benchmark with 10M frames and 180K hand capture trajectories, whose target motions are organized into 8 major categories and 22 fine-grained subcategories. We also provide a simple observe-before-act baseline (ObAct) that integrates short-term observations with the current frame via spatiotemporal attention to predict actions, achieving an 8.1% improvement in location success rate.

TL;DR: This study introduces a machine learning framework that generates synthetic LGE images and annotated masks using neural networks and diffusion models to improve fibrosis segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of annotated datasets for myocardial scar assessment limits the development of segmentation methods for clinical use.

Method: The framework combines implicit neural representations (INRs) and denoising diffusion models to generate synthetic LGE images and segmentation masks. It trains INRs to capture spatial data, compresses these into latent space, and utilizes a diffusion model for generation.

Result: When augmenting with 200 synthetic volumes, the Dice score for fibrosis segmentation improved from 0.509 to 0.524, demonstrating improved performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an annotation-free method to mitigate data scarcity, supporting better segmentation model training.

Abstract: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for PDF-to-Markdown conversion, focusing on challenging French documents, especially in RAG pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance document parsing performance in Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines by addressing transcription and layout errors in non-English benchmarks, particularly French documents.

Method: A French-focused benchmark was introduced using model-disagreement sampling, evaluating 15 models with unit-test-style checks targeting specific failure modes and category-normalized metrics.

Result: Proprietary models excel in handwriting and forms, while open-weight systems perform competitively on standard printed layouts.

Conclusion: The study highlights model performance disparity and offers insights to improve document parsing robustness in diverse layouts and languages.

Abstract: This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic optimization framework with a novel loss function and post-hoc calibration technique, improving reliability and uncertainty quantification in AI-driven medical imaging systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of miscalibration in deep learning models used in AI-assisted decision-making for medical imaging, ensuring outputs are reliable and uncertainty estimates correlate with prediction correctness.

Method: The proposed framework includes a Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) to align prediction correctness with uncertainty and a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy for post-hoc calibration.

Result: The framework showed consistent improvement in calibration across various medical imaging tasks, performed well with limited data, and handled imbalanced datasets effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance calibration and reliability of AI-driven medical imaging systems, making them more suitable for real clinical deployment.

Abstract: In critical decision support systems based on medical imaging, the reliability of AI-assisted decision-making is as relevant as predictive accuracy. Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.

*Wei Chen,Yancheng Long,Mingqiao Liu,Haojie Ding,Yankai Yang,Hongyang Wei,Yi-Fan Zhang,Bin Wen,Fan Yang,Tingting Gao,Han Li,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), enhancing diffusion models' spatial reasoning through a plug-and-play framework that uses MLLMs for layout planning. It achieves high performance in benchmark tests and image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel at visual synthesis but struggle with spatial reasoning. Existing solutions are computationally heavy or lose spatial details through text prompts.

Method: The SCoT framework improves diffusion models by training with text-coordinate instructions and utilizes MLLMs to generate advanced layout plans for spatial understanding.

Result: Experiments show superior performance in image synthesis benchmarks, spatial reasoning tasks, and image editing compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SCoT successfully integrates MLLMs as planners to improve spatial reasoning capabilities in diffusion models, making them more effective for generation and editing.

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in aesthetic image synthesis, they often struggle with complex spatial understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper explores generative AI methods to improve activity recognition in newborn resuscitation videos, achieving significant progress with fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance documentation and improve the recognition of key activities during newborn resuscitation for better quality assurance and adherence to clinical guidelines.

Method: The authors use vision-language models (VLMs) combined with large language models (LLMs) to detect activities in videos. They compare these strategies to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline, employing techniques like LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs with LoRA achieve an F1 score of 0.91, outperforming the TimeSFormer method's score of 0.70.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned local VLMs, despite initial struggles with hallucinations, show significant potential for improving activity recognition in newborn resuscitation scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.

Method: The ReNoV framework employs representation projection modules to incorporate external visual representations into diffusion-based synthesis processes, enhancing semantic and geometric correspondence.

Result: ReNoV demonstrates superior reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality compared to existing methods in experiments with standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: By integrating external representations into the diffusion process, ReNoV achieves robust and consistent novel view synthesis, pushing the boundaries of handling sparse image collections.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for diffusion-based novel view synthesis in which we leverage external representations as conditions, harnessing their geometric and semantic correspondence properties for enhanced geometric consistency in generated novel viewpoints. First, we provide a detailed analysis exploring the correspondence capabilities emergent in the spatial attention of external visual representations. Building from these insights, we propose a representation-guided novel view synthesis through dedicated representation projection modules that inject external representations into the diffusion process, a methodology named ReNoV, short for representation-guided novel view synthesis. Our experiments show that this design yields marked improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality, outperforming prior diffusion-based novel-view methods on standard benchmarks and enabling robust synthesis from sparse, unposed image collections.

The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosterOmni is a framework designed for combining local editing and global creation tasks in image-to-poster generation with a reward-based pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of generating posters from images, which require both local editing and global design understanding.

Method: PosterOmni uses a data-distillation-reward pipeline, which includes dataset creation, knowledge distillation for fine-tuning, and reward feedback for aligning entity-preserving and aesthetic preferences.

Result: PosterOmni improves adherence to reference, composition quality, and aesthetic coherence, outperforming open-source and proprietary systems.

Conclusion: PosterOmni successfully integrates local and global design tasks into one system, demonstrating superior performance in artistic poster generation.

Abstract: Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.

*Yeyao Ma,Chen Li,Xiaosong Zhang,Han Hu,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAIL, a fine-tuning method for flow matching models using adversarial imitation learning to align with target distributions, avoiding policy drift and reward modeling challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning address expert demonstration alignment but fail in unseen states, while preference optimization methods are resource-intensive. This paper aims to address these limitations with a more efficient approach.

Method: The authors propose FAIL (Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning) which minimizes policy-expert divergence using adversarial training, without relying on explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. Two algorithms are presented: FAIL-PD for differentiable ODE solvers and FAIL-PG for black-box or discrete setups.

Result: FAIL effectively fine-tuned FLUX with a limited dataset, achieving performance competitive with existing models on prompt following and aesthetic tasks. It generalizes to discrete image and video generation and serves as a robust regularizer in reward-based optimization.

Conclusion: FAIL demonstrates that adversarial imitation learning can overcome traditional limitations of imitation learning and reward modeling, providing a scalable and versatile framework for fine-tuning flow matching models in various domains.

Abstract: Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TexSpot, a novel framework for improving 3D texture generation using a new representation called Texlet, which merges strengths of UV and point-based textures and utilizes diffusion transformers for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D texture generation faces challenges like view-inconsistency in multi-view methods and issues with current representations, such as UV map distortion or the limitations of point-based methods in generating high-resolution textures.

Method: The authors propose TexSpot, which uses a novel Texlet representation. Texlets encode local texture patches using a 2D encoder and aggregate them via a 3D encoder, followed by a cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder for texture reconstruction. A diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets enhances textures created by existing multi-view diffusion techniques.

Result: TexSpot achieves enhanced visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over current state-of-the-art 3D texture generation methods, as validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: TexSpot effectively addresses limitations of existing 3D texture representations and improves generation quality, offering a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing approaches that treat human-centric audio-video generation tasks independently and struggle with disentangled character and voice control.

Method: Proposes a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer for integrating conditioning signals, a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy to handle identity-timbre binding and speaker confusion, and a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme to unify multiple tasks.

Result: DreamID-Omni outperforms existing methods and commercial models in video, audio, and audio-visual consistency through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DreamID-Omni offers a unified, controllable framework for audio-video generation and reliably handles challenges in multi-character and multi-voice scenarios, bridging research and commercial-grade applications by releasing its code.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unique characteristics of Earth observation data, such as varying sensor specifications and spectral channels, require a flexible tokenizer model for efficient generative image and video modeling.

Method: EO-VAE employs a single model using dynamic hypernetworks to encode and reconstruct diverse channel combinations, instead of training separate tokenizers for each sensor modality.

Result: On the TerraMesh dataset, EO-VAE outperforms the TerraMind tokenizers in reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: EO-VAE establishes itself as a strong baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing applications due to its adaptability and improved reconstruction performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art generative image and video models rely heavily on tokenizers that compress high-dimensional inputs into more efficient latent representations. While this paradigm has revolutionized RGB generation, Earth observation (EO) data presents unique challenges due to diverse sensor specifications and variable spectral channels. We propose EO-VAE, a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed to serve as a foundational tokenizer for the EO domain. Unlike prior approaches that train separate tokenizers for each modality, EO-VAE utilizes a single model to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations via dynamic hypernetworks. Our experiments on the TerraMesh dataset demonstrate that EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the TerraMind tokenizers, establishing a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

Method: The authors introduce the Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB) framework, data-centric progressive training stages (alignment pre-training, joint supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning with MR-GRPO), and utilize hierarchical guidance for robust semantic control.

Result: DeepGen 1.0 significantly outperformed other models, including the 80B HunyuanImage and 27B Qwen-Image-Edit, in benchmarks such as WISE and UniREditBench, despite being trained on fewer samples (~50M).

Conclusion: DeepGen 1.0 demonstrates that lightweight models can rival or exceed larger counterparts in multimodal tasks while reducing resource barriers, providing accessible alternatives in the research.

Abstract: Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Monarch-RT, a structured attention mechanism optimizing video diffusion for real-time generation, addressing inefficiencies in prior sparse attention approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient real-time video generation is hindered by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, with existing models failing in few-step, autoregressive settings.

Method: Monarch-RT uses a structured attention parameterization with Monarch matrices, tuned for computational efficiency through Triton kernels and aligned block design.

Result: Monarch-RT achieves up to 95% attention sparsity with no quality loss and significant kernel speedups (1.4-11.8X) for video generation on cutting-edge GPUs.

Conclusion: Monarch-RT enables true real-time video generation at 16 FPS on an RTX 5090, outperforming alternatives and demonstrating superior sparse attention parameterization.

Abstract: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniT, a framework enabling multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning in a unified model, allowing for iterative refinement and improving multimodal generation and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified models currently handle multimodal tasks in a single pass, but many complex tasks require iterative reasoning, verification, and refinement, which current models struggle with.

Method: UniT integrates agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to perform iterative reasoning and exhibit cognitive behaviors such as verification and subgoal decomposition.

Result: The study finds that training on short reasoning improves longer inference chains, sequential reasoning scales better and more efficiently than parallel sampling, and generation/editing training enhances out-of-distribution visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Multimodal test-time scaling is an effective method to improve both generation and understanding in unified models, opening pathways for advanced multimodal reasoning paradigms.

Abstract: Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

*Huai-Hsun Cheng,Siang-Ling Zhang,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework called "Stroke of Surprise" to create semantic illusions by sequentially transforming one sketch into another through optimized vector strokes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to expand the ability of visual illusions from spatial manipulation into temporal transformations, allowing one sketch to semantically transform into another through progressive strokes.

Method: A sequence-aware joint optimization framework is proposed using dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism paired with an Overlay Loss to ensure coherence and complementarity between progressive sketches.

Result: Experimental results show that the approach outperforms existing methods in recognizability and illusion strength, pushing the boundaries of visual anagrams from spatial to temporal dimensions.

Conclusion: The work introduces Progressive Semantic Illusions, successfully demonstrating a generative framework for optimizing dual-concept sketches, offering advancements in visual illusion techniques.

Abstract: Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a "common structural subspace" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

TL;DR: The paper proposes VRFT-Aug, a framework using visual reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance perception and reasoning for medical imaging tasks. It outperforms existing methods and offers practical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective performance in medical imaging tasks remains challenging, requiring both visual perception and structured reasoning. Current rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning approaches lack exploration in cross-modal, vision-centric domains like medical imaging.

Method: Introducing VRFT-Aug framework, which incorporates prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation to improve medical visual reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets show VRFT-Aug surpasses traditional supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines, providing empirically backed training heuristics.

Conclusion: The VRFT-Aug framework provides a robust solution for enhancing reasoning and perception in medical imaging tasks, offering practical guidance for future cross-modal applications in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: While recent advances in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) have shown that rule-based reward schemes can enable effective post-training for large language models, their extension to cross-modal, vision-centric domains remains largely underexplored. This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.
  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks. We hope this work contributes actionable guidance and fresh inspiration for the ongoing effort to develop reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications.

*Reginald Frank,Soujanya Ponnapalli,Octavio Lomeli,Neil Giridharan,Marcos K Aguilera,Natacha Crooks*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional consensus protocols for their reliance on an oversimplified failure model and proposes a probabilistic approach for better fault tolerance and system optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current $f$-threshold failure model in consensus protocols oversimplifies fault behaviors and hinders potential optimizations in performance, cost, and reliability.

Method: The authors propose using probabilistic failure models that leverage individual machine failure curves and avoid rigid majority quorum intersection constraints.

Result: Probabilistic consensus protocols can achieve greater system reliability, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability.

Conclusion: Adopting probabilistic failure models in consensus protocols unlocks better optimization opportunities while addressing the complexities of real-world faults.

Abstract: Modern distributed systems rely on consensus protocols to build a fault-tolerant-core upon which they can build applications. Consensus protocols are correct under a specific failure model, where up to $f$ machines can fail. We argue that this $f$-threshold failure model oversimplifies the real world and limits potential opportunities to optimize for cost or performance. We argue instead for a probabilistic failure model that captures the complex and nuanced nature of faults observed in practice. Probabilistic consensus protocols can explicitly leverage individual machine \textit{failure curves} and explore side-stepping traditional bottlenecks such as majority quorum intersection, enabling systems that are more reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable.

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of creating an accurate, available, and scalable rate limiter in distributed systems using Redis and its structured data handling capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the difficulty of achieving a balance between accuracy, availability, scalability, and consistency in rate limiting, particularly in distributed systems.

Method: They designed a distributed rate limiting architecture using Redis's in-memory caching system, employing its Sorted Set data structure along with Lua scripting to execute atomic operations and ensure precision.

Result: The trade-offs of Rolling Window vs Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms were quantified, and a three-layer architecture was implemented for scalable, accurate rule updates within a Redis Cluster.

Conclusion: The study effectively demonstrates how choosing AP from the CAP theorem along with Redis optimizations enables an efficient, scalable, and race-condition-free rate limiting system.

Abstract: Designing a rate limiter that is simultaneously accurate, available, and scalable presents a fundamental challenge in distributed systems, primarily due to the trade-offs between algorithmic precision, availability, consistency, and partition tolerance. This article presents a concrete architecture for a distributed rate limiting system in a production-grade environment. Our design chooses the in-memory cache database, the Redis, along with its Sorted Set data structure, which provides $O(log (N))$ time complexity operation for the key-value pair dataset with efficiency and low latency, and maintains precision. The core contribution is quantifying the accuracy and memory cost trade-off of the chosen Rolling Window as the implemented rate limiting algorithm against the Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms. In addition, we explain how server-side Lua scripting is critical to bundling cleanup, counting, and insertion into a single atomic operation, thereby eliminating race conditions in concurrent environments. In the system architecture, we propose a three-layer architecture that manages the storage and updating of the limit rules. Through script load by hashing the rule parameters, rules can be changed without modifying the cached scripts. Furthermore, we analyze the deployment of this architecture on a Redis Cluster, which provides the availability and scalability by data sharding and replication. We explain the acceptance of AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from the CAP theorem as the pragmatic engineering trade-off for this use case.

TL;DR: SparrowRL enables efficient RL post-training for large models in environments with standard Ethernet and WAN connectivity by leveraging sparse update transmission and optimized scheduling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address infrastructure cost and inefficiency issues in RL post-training, particularly for organizations without access to dedicated RDMA HPC clusters.

Method: SparrowRL uses sparse delta representation for updates, multi-stream transmission, pipelining, and bandwidth-aware scheduling to optimize distributed RL training over commodity-networked GPUs.

Result: SparrowRL achieves significant reductions in payload size and improves throughput substantially, narrowing the performance gap with RDMA-enabled setups and improving cost efficiency.

Conclusion: SparrowRL makes RL fine-tuning practical on commodity networks, offering a cost-effective and high-performance alternative to dedicated RDMA clusters.

Abstract: LLM post-training with reinforcement learning (RL) requires frequent synchronization of large model parameters between the trainer and distributed rollout actors. High-throughput RL post-training therefore relies on dedicated RDMA HPC clusters, an infrastructure cost most organizations cannot absorb. A natural alternative is to aggregate loosely-coupled GPUs over standard Ethernet and WAN links, but this commodity connectivity cannot sustain full-weight broadcasts: synchronizing an 8B model can take over 100~seconds on bandwidth-limited links, while rollout generation typically takes tens of seconds.
  Toward making RL practical in this regime, we observe that RL fine-tuning yields highly sparse per-step updates, with only around 1\% of parameter elements changing. Atop this insight, we present SparrowRL, a novel high-performance RL training system that preserves bit-exact updates without dropping or quantizing information, designed for commodity-networked, loosely-coupled GPU resources. SparrowRL represents each step as a sparse delta checkpoint, pipelines delta extraction with multi-stream transmission, overlaps transfer with rollout generation, and coordinates heterogeneous workers with throughput- and bandwidth-aware scheduling plus lease-based fault tolerance. On Qwen3 models from 4B to 14B deployed across up to four geographic regions, SparrowRL reduces per-step transfer payload by 79$\times$ for Qwen3-8B and improves throughput by 2.4--9.5$\times$ over full-weight broadcast across WAN, narrowing the throughput gap relative to an ideal RDMA single-datacenter baseline to within 8.91\%. By leveraging on-demand, cross-cloud GPUs over commodity links, SparrowRL delivers 1.21--1.59$\times$ higher tokens per dollar than reserved RDMA clusters at comparable throughput.

*Yiming Zhou,Kaiping Xue,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents DPPS, a protocol-level differential privacy solution for decentralized networks, addressing privacy vulnerabilities through noise addition. It also introduces PartPSP, enhancing optimization performance with a reduced privacy-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized networks lack inherent safeguards against privacy breaches due to inference by neighboring nodes. Existing privacy solutions often rely on task-specific methods and fail to provide scalable, generalized protocol-level security.

Method: DPPS introduces a lightweight differential privacy mechanism with a novel sensitivity estimation strategy requiring minimal communication. Furthermore, PartPSP, a decentralized optimization algorithm, adopts partial communication for better privacy-utility balance by applying DPPS to shared parameters only.

Result: DPPS ensures rigorous differential privacy in decentralized communication, while PartPSP demonstrates superior optimization performance and privacy guarantee compared to existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed DPPS protocol provides a general, efficient differential privacy solution for decentralized applications. PartPSP showcases its utility by achieving superior optimization under privacy constraints, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: In decentralized networks, nodes cannot ensure that their shared information will be securely preserved by their neighbors, making privacy vulnerable to inference by curious nodes. Adding calibrated random noise before communication to satisfy differential privacy offers a proven defense; however, most existing methods are tailored to specific downstream tasks and lack a general, protocol-level privacy-preserving solution. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum (DPPS), a lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized communication. Since protocol-level differential privacy introduces the unique challenge of obtaining the sensitivity for each communication round, DPPS introduces a novel sensitivity estimation mechanism that requires each node to compute and broadcast only one scalar per round, enabling rigorous differential privacy guarantees. This design allows DPPS to serve as a plug-and-play, low-cost privacy-preserving solution for downstream applications built on it. To provide a concrete instantiation of DPPS and better balance the privacy-utility trade-off, we design PartPSP, a privacy-preserving decentralized algorithm for non-convex optimization that integrates a partial communication mechanism. By partitioning model parameters into local and shared components and applying DPPS only to the shared parameters, PartPSP reduces the dimensionality of consensus data, thereby lowering the magnitude of injected noise and improving optimization performance. We theoretically prove that PartPSP converges under non-convex objectives and, with partial communication, achieves better optimization performance under the same privacy budget. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of DPPS's privacy-preserving and demonstrate that PartPSP outperforms existing privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithms.

*Xinyi Liu,Yujie Wang,Fangcheng Fu,Xuefeng Xiao,Huixia Li,Jiashi Li,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces LAER-MoE, a framework for training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with improved load balancing and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic routing during expert parallel training causes significant load imbalances, which slow down training iterations.

Method: The paper proposes Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP) to partition expert parameters across devices and uses a load balancing planner alongside fine-grained communication scheduling.

Result: Experiments on an A100 cluster show the framework achieves up to 1.69x speedup compared to current state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: LAER-MoE addresses load imbalance and communication inefficiencies in MoE training, improving performance and scalability.

Abstract: Expert parallelism is vital for effectively training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, enabling different devices to host distinct experts, with each device processing different input data. However, during expert parallel training, dynamic routing results in significant load imbalance among experts: a handful of overloaded experts hinder overall iteration, emerging as a training bottleneck.
  In this paper, we introduce LAER-MoE, an efficient MoE training framework. The core of LAER-MoE is a novel parallel paradigm, Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP), which fully partitions each expert parameter by the number of devices and restores partial experts at expert granularity through All-to-All communication during training. This allows for flexible re-layout of expert parameters during training to enhance load balancing. In particular, we perform fine-grained scheduling of communication operations to minimize communication overhead. Additionally, we develop a load balancing planner to formulate re-layout strategies of experts and routing schemes for tokens during training. We perform experiments on an A100 cluster, and the results indicate that our system achieves up to 1.69x acceleration compared to the current state-of-the-art training systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism leveraging Docker swarm for efficient offloading of computationintensive tasks across multiple IoT-based local servers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently offloading and processing computation-intensive tasks for IoT devices remains complex, especially regarding resource management and cost optimization.

Method: An auction-based mechanism (AUC-RAC) using Docker swarm to connect IoT devices with Manager Node and Worker Nodes for task allocation and execution through bidding.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the improved efficiency and collaboration between local servers in computation and task offloading processes.

Conclusion: AUC-RAC successfully enhances computation-intensive task handling in IoT environments, optimizing task allocation and resource utilization effectively.

Abstract: Distributed computing has enabled cooperation between multiple computing devices for the simultaneous execution of resource-hungry tasks. Such execution also plays a pivotal role in the parallel execution of numerous tasks in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Leveraging the computing resources of multiple devices, the offloading and processing of computationintensive tasks can be carried out more efficiently. However, managing resources and optimizing costs remain challenging for successfully executing tasks in cloud-based containerization for IoT. This paper proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism for efficient offloading of computation tasks among multiple local servers in the context of IoT devices. The approach leverages the concept of Docker swarm, which connects multiple local servers in the form of Manager Node (MN) and Worker Nodes (WNs). It uses Docker containerization to execute tasks simultaneously. In this system, IoT devices send tasks to the MN, which then sends the task details to all its WNs to participate in the auction-based bidding process. The auctionbased bidding process optimizes the allocation of computation tasks among multiple systems, considering their resource sufficiency. The experimental analysis establishes that the approach offers improved offloading and computation-intensive services for IoT devices by enabling cooperation between local servers.

*Zixi Cai,Kuowen Chen,Shengquan Du,Tsvi Kopelowitz,Seth Pettie,Ben Plosk*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper focuses on the Contention Resolution problem, where $n$ parties aim to access a shared resource under various assumptions. It introduces new protocols and highlights complexity gaps under global and local clock setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reexamine the common assumption of local clocks in the Contention Resolution problem and explore the effects of introducing a global clock, potentially enriching the problem and enabling new techniques.

Method: Introduces and analyzes randomized Contention Resolution protocols with varying assumptions of global clock availability, focusing on metrics such as expected latency and high-probability guarantees.

Result: The authors establish a $
log n$ complexity gap between global and local clock setups, identify a $
log n$-factor gap between expected latency and high-probability guarantees, and show that simultaneous optimization under both metrics is impossible.

Conclusion: Using a global clock enriches the Contention Resolution problem and offers new insights into its complexity. However, trade-offs exist between optimizing for In-Expectation and With-High-Probability guarantees, making simultaneous optimization infeasible.

Abstract: In the Contention Resolution problem $n$ parties each wish to have exclusive use of a shared resource for one unit of time. The problem has been studied since the early 1970s, under a variety of assumptions on feedback given to the parties, how the parties wake up, knowledge of $n$, and so on. The most consistent assumption is that parties do not have access to a global clock, only their local time since wake-up. This is surprising because the assumption of a global clock is both technologically realistic and algorithmically interesting. It enriches the problem, and opens the door to entirely new techniques. Our primary results are: [1] We design a new Contention Resolution protocol that guarantees latency $$O\left(\left(n\log\log n\log^{(3)} n\log^{(4)} n\cdots \log^{(\log^* n)} n\right)\cdot 2^{\log^* n}\right) \le n(\log\log n)^{1+o(1)}$$ in expectation and with high probability. This already establishes at least a roughly $\log n$ complexity gap between randomized protocols in GlobalClock and LocalClock. [2] Prior analyses of randomized ContentionResolution protocols in LocalClock guaranteed a certain latency with high probability, i.e., with probability $1-1/\text{poly}(n)$. We observe that it is just as natural to measure expected latency, and prove a $\log n$-factor complexity gap between the two objectives for memoryless protocols. The In-Expectation complexity is $Θ(n \log n/\log\log n)$ whereas the With-High-Probability latency is $Θ(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$. Three of these four upper and lower bounds are new. [3] Given the complexity separation above, one would naturally want a ContentionResolution protocol that is optimal under both the In-Expectation and With-High-Probability metrics. This is impossible! It is even impossible to achieve In-Expectation latency $o(n\log^2 n/(\log\log n)^2)$ and With-High-Probability latency $n\log^{O(1)} n$ simultaneously.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: OServe is a system designed to improve the serving of large language models (LLMs) by addressing spatial and temporal heterogeneity in workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM serving systems struggle with spatially and temporally heterogeneous workloads, as they typically assume uniform and stable conditions, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: OServe employs a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm for optimizing heterogeneous model deployments and a workload-adaptive switching method to adjust deployments based on predicted workload changes.

Result: Experiments using real-world traces demonstrate up to a 2× performance improvement with OServe, averaging a 1.5× improvement over state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: OServe successfully enhances the performance and efficiency of LLM serving by handling dynamic and heterogeneous workloads through adaptive scheduling and deployment strategies.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) can benefit immensely from parallelizing both the model and input requests across multiple devices, but incoming workloads exhibit substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Spatially, workloads comprise heterogeneous requests with varying compute and memory demands. Temporally, workload composition varies over time. Nevertheless, existing systems typically assume spatially uniform and temporally stable workloads, employing a homogeneous, static model deployment. This mismatch between the assumption and real-world spatial-temporal heterogeneity results in suboptimal performance. We present OServe, an LLM serving system with heterogeneous and flexible model deployment that addresses both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. First, OServe introduces a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm that optimizes heterogeneous model deployments according to real-time workload characteristics. Second, OServe proposes an efficient workload-adaptive switching method that migrates model deployments in response to predicted workload changes. Experiments on real-world traces show that OServe improves performance by up to 2$\times$ (average: 1.5$\times$) compared to state-of-the-art serving systems.

### [246] [Predictive Associative Memory: Retrieval Beyond Similarity Through Temporal Co-occurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11322)
*Jason Dury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Predictive Associative Memory (PAM) for associative recall based on temporal co-occurrence, demonstrating superior recall accuracy compared to similarity-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural systems primarily rely on similarity-based retrieval, overlooking biological memory's property of association through temporal co-occurrence.

Method: The authors propose PAM using a JEPA-style predictor trained on temporal co-occurrence within continuous experiences, complemented by Inward and Outward JEPA mechanisms.

Result: PAM achieves high precision in recalling temporal associations, distinguishes co-occurrence-based links effectively, and surpasses cosine similarity retrieval benchmarks significantly.

Conclusion: PAM effectively recalls temporally associated experiences by learning underlying co-occurrence patterns, presenting a novel approach to associative memory in neural systems.

Abstract: Current approaches to memory in neural systems rely on similarity-based retrieval: given a query, find the most representationally similar stored state. This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance). A temporal shuffle control confirms the signal is genuine temporal co-occurrence structure, not embedding geometry: shuffling collapses cross-boundary recall by 90%, replicated across training seeds. All results are stable across seeds (SD < 0.006) and query selections (SD $\leq$ 0.012).

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using the Roofline model to measure performance limits of Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge hardware. It introduces metrics to evaluate efficiency among architectures and identifies influences like sequence length and model depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to localized intelligence (SLMs) demands accurate performance evaluation across heterogeneous edge hardware, highlighting the need for systematic approaches.

Method: Develop a systematic framework based on the Roofline model with metrics such as Relative Inference Potential to analyze efficiency across models and computing tiers.

Result: Empirical results show performance and operational intensity are affected by sequence length and model depth. Structural refinements like Multi-head Latent Attention unlock better efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework enables comparisons of hardware-software efficiency for neural models, offering strategies for co-design to optimize inference on edge platforms.

Abstract: The transition toward localized intelligence through Small Language Models (SLMs) has intensified the need for rigorous performance characterization on resource-constrained edge hardware. However, objectively measuring the theoretical performance ceilings of diverse architectures across heterogeneous platforms remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we propose a systematic framework based on the Roofline model that unifies architectural primitives and hardware constraints through the lens of operational intensity (OI). By defining an inference-potential region, we introduce the Relative Inference Potential as a novel metric to compare efficiency differences between Large Language Models (LLMs) on the same hardware substrate. Extensive empirical analysis across diverse compute tiers reveals that variations in performance and OI are significantly influenced by sequence length. We further identify a critical regression in OI as model depth increases. Additionally, our findings highlight an efficiency trap induced by hardware heterogeneity and demonstrate how structural refinements, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (M LA), can effectively unlock latent inference potential across various hardware substrates. These insights provide actionable directions for hardware-software co-design to align neural structures with physical constraints in on-device intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIND, a framework to improve Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated optimization modeling by addressing data limitations through localized error-driven learning and refining difficult problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current LLMs for optimization modeling, particularly the lack of high-quality training data and the inefficiencies in handling specific errors and sparse rewards.

Method: The authors propose MIND, an error-driven learning framework centered on error localization. It utilizes Dynamic Supervised Fine-Tuning Policy Optimization (DFPO) to refine performance by synthesizing focused high-density training data and addressing localized issues.

Result: MIND outperforms state-of-the-art optimization modeling methods across six benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy in localized improvement.

Conclusion: Localized learning and refinement of LLM models via MIND can significantly enhance optimization modeling, overcoming issues of data sparsity and inefficiency.

Abstract: Automated optimization modeling via Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to assist complex human decision-making. While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems. We demonstrate that these limitations can result in suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs. To tackle the above two limitations, we propose a novel error-driven learning framework -- namely, auto\textbf{m}ated opt\textbf{i}mization modeli\textbf{n}g via a localizable error-\textbf{d}riven perspective (MIND) -- that customizes the whole model training framework from data synthesis to post-training. MIND is based on our key observation of the unique localizable patterns in error propagation of optimization modelings, that is, modeling errors may remain localized to specific semantic segments and do not propagate throughout the entire solution. Thus, in contrast to holistic reasoning tasks such as mathematical proofs, MIND leverages the construction of a focused, high-density training corpus and proposes \textbf{D}ynamic Supervised \textbf{F}ine-Tuning \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (DFPO) to tackle difficult problems through localized refinement. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MIND consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art automated optimization modeling approaches.

### [249] [KBVQ-MoE: KLT-guided SVD with Bias-Corrected Vector Quantization for MoE Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11184)
*Zukang Xu,Zhixiong Zhao,Xing Hu,Zhixuan Chen,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KBVQ-MoE, a framework for ultra-low-bit quantization in Mixture of Experts (MoE) large language models, addressing challenges in redundancy and output bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the parameter size and memory demands of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models in resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient deployment.

Method: Proposed KBVQ-MoE framework using (1) Karhunen-Loeve Transform-based input redundancy elimination, and (2) bias-corrected vector quantization of expert-specific weights for better compression.

Result: 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieved nearly the same accuracy (67.99) as its FP16 baseline (68.07), proving superior performance to existing quantization methods.

Conclusion: KBVQ-MoE enables high-performance, efficient quantization in MoEs without significant accuracy loss, making it feasible for deployment in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have achieved great success by significantly improving performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse expert activation. However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms.

### [250] [Spectra: Rethinking Optimizers for LLMs Under Spectral Anisotropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11185)
*Zhendong Huang,Hengjie Cao,Fang Dong,Ruijun Huang,Mengyi Chen,Yifeng Yang,Xin Zhang,Anrui Chen,Mingzhi Dong,Yujiang Wang,Jinlong Hou,Qin Lv,Robert P. Dick,Yuan Cheng,Fan Yang,Tun Lu,Li Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spectra, an optimizer designed to better handle anisotropic gradient signals in large language model (LLM) training, showing faster convergence and improved efficiency compared to existing optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize LLM training by addressing anisotropic gradient signals that suppress learning in context-specific information.

Method: Develop the Spectra optimizer which suppresses dominant low-rank spike subspaces using spectral shaping without amplifying noise-sensitive tails. It incorporates cached power iteration and maintains efficiency.

Result: Spectra achieves 30% faster convergence, reduces memory by 49.25%, overhead by 0.7%, and improves downstream model accuracy by 1.62%. Compared to Muon, it is 5.1x faster in processing time, achieves lower loss, and improves accuracy by 0.66%.

Conclusion: Spectra demonstrates significant efficiency improvements in LLM training, achieving faster convergence, reduced memory and overhead, and higher accuracy, making it a promising alternative to current optimizers like AdamW and Muon.

Abstract: Gradient signals in LLM training are highly anisotropic: recurrent linguistic structure concentrates energy into a small set of dominant spectral directions, while context specific information resides in a long tail. We show that this spike tail separation persists throughout training, with the spike occupying only about 1.5% of directions yet dominating optimizer statistics. This dominance suppresses tail learning by contracting tail updates through second moment normalization and tightening the globally stable learning rate bound. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Spectra, a spike aware optimizer that suppresses the dominant low rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise sensitive spectral tail. Spectra tracks the spike subspace via cached, warm started power iteration and applies low rank spectral shaping with negligible overhead and substantially reduced optimizer state memory. On LLaMA3 8B trained on 50B tokens, Spectra reaches the same target loss 30% faster than AdamW, reduces per step end to end overhead by 0.7%, cuts optimizer state memory by 49.25%, and improves average downstream accuracy by 1.62%. Compared to Muon, Spectra is 5.1x faster in optimizer processing time, achieves a lower final loss, and improves average accuracy by 0.66%.

### [251] [UltraLIF: Fully Differentiable Spiking Neural Networks via Ultradiscretization and Max-Plus Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11206)
*Jose Marie Antonio Miñoza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes UltraLIF, a framework to address challenges in Spiking Neural Networks' differentiability via ultradiscretization from tropical geometry, enabling fully differentiable SNNs trainable through standard backpropagation and showing improved results in various benchmarks with energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenge of non-differentiable spike generation in Spiking Neural Networks, which traditionally rely on surrogate gradients, by introducing a biologically plausible and mathematically principled alternative using ultradiscretization.

Method: The authors introduce UltraLIF and UltraDLIF, neuron models derived from the LIF and diffusion equations, respectively. These models leverage ultradiscretization using the log-sum-exp function for differentiability and are trained with standard backpropagation techniques without forward-backward mismatch.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms pointwise convergence to LIF dynamics with bounded gradients. Experimental results on static image, neuromorphic, and audio benchmarks show improvements over surrogate gradient methods, with pronounced gains in single-timestep tasks and optional sparsity penalties reducing energy consumption while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed UltraLIF framework enhances the differentiability and energy efficiency of SNNs, exhibiting superior performance to traditional methods and promising applications in both static and temporal datasets.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient, biologically plausible computation but suffer from non-differentiable spike generation, necessitating reliance on heuristic surrogate gradients. This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\eps \to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets. An optional sparsity penalty enables significant energy reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy.

*Zhihan Zeng,Kaihe Wang,Zhongpei Zhang,Yue Xiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents GAC-KAN, a lightweight and efficient AI model for GNSS security in the computationally demanding GenAI era.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the data scarcity and resource limitations of edge devices for security tasks in the GenAI-integrated Consumer Electronics.

Method: A physics-guided simulation generates a high-fidelity dataset, and an efficient AI model (MS-GAC backbone with KAN) is developed for resource-constrained environments.

Result: GAC-KAN achieves 98.0% accuracy with only 0.13 million parameters, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models like Vision Transformer by being 660 times smaller.

Conclusion: GAC-KAN is an efficient, lightweight solution ensuring GNSS reliability with minimal resource usage, making it applicable in GenAI-dominated Consumer Electronics contexts.

Abstract: The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into Consumer Electronics (CE)--from AI-powered assistants in wearables to generative planning in autonomous Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)--has revolutionized user experiences. However, these GenAI applications impose immense computational burdens on edge hardware, leaving strictly limited resources for fundamental security tasks like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal protection. Furthermore, training robust classifiers for such devices is hindered by the scarcity of real-world interference data. To address the dual challenges of data scarcity and the extreme efficiency required by the GenAI era, this paper proposes a novel framework named GAC-KAN. First, we adopt a physics-guided simulation approach to synthesize a large-scale, high-fidelity jamming dataset, mitigating the data bottleneck. Second, to reconcile high accuracy with the stringent resource constraints of GenAI-native chips, we design a Multi-Scale Ghost-ACB-Coordinate (MS-GAC) backbone. This backbone combines Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACB) and Ghost modules to extract rich spectral-temporal features with minimal redundancy. Replacing the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) decision head, we introduce a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which employs learnable spline activation functions to achieve superior non-linear mapping capabilities with significantly fewer parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that GAC-KAN achieves an overall accuracy of 98.0\%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Significantly, the model contains only 0.13 million parameter--approximately 660 times fewer than Vision Transformer (ViT) baselines. This extreme lightweight characteristic makes GAC-KAN an ideal "always-on" security companion, ensuring GNSS reliability without contending for the computational resources required by primary GenAI tasks.

### [253] [Learning Glioblastoma Tumor Heterogeneity Using Brain Inspired Topological Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11234)
*Ankita Paul,Wenyi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopoGBM is a novel learning framework that uses topological regularization to improve prognosis prediction for Glioblastoma (GBM) from multi-parametric 3D MRI, addressing spatial/structural heterogeneity and scanner inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models struggle with the variability and heterogeneity of GBM tumors and suffer poor generalization due to inconsistencies in MRI acquisition across institutions.

Method: TopoGBM uses a 3D convolutional autoencoder with topological regularization to preserve non-Euclidean invariants of tumor structure, enabling robust, heterogeneity-preserved representations for GBM prognosis.

Result: TopoGBM outperformed baseline models, showing superior performance with C-index scores of 0.67 on test sets and 0.58 on validation. The model accurately localized heterogeneous zones and attributed 50% of prognostic signal to tumor-associated regions.

Conclusion: Incorporating topological priors allows TopoGBM to create robust, morphology-faithful embeddings, improving interpretability and cross-institutional reliability for GBM prognosis.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis for Glioblastoma (GBM) using deep learning (DL) is hindered by extreme spatial and structural heterogeneity. Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness.

*Yubo Hou,Furen Zhuang,Partha Pratim Kundu,Sezin Ata Kircali,Jie Wang,Mihai Dragos Rotaru,Dutta Rahul,Ashish James*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TDPNavigator-Placer optimizes chiplet placement in 2.5D ICs using multi-agent reinforcement learning, balancing wirelength and thermal management objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses conflicting design objectives in chiplet placement, such as wirelength reduction and thermal management, which are inadequately handled by existing methods.

Method: The proposed approach uses multi-agent reinforcement learning with distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints to optimize chiplet placement for better thermal and wirelength performance.

Result: TDPNavigator-Placer achieves improved Pareto front compared to state-of-the-art methods, leading to balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal management.

Conclusion: The method introduces an effective solution for automated chiplet placement, enabling scalable and practical optimization in 2.5D IC design.

Abstract: The rapid growth of electronics has accelerated the adoption of 2.5D integrated circuits, where effective automated chiplet placement is essential as systems scale to larger and more heterogeneous chiplet assemblies. Existing placement methods typically focus on minimizing wirelength or transforming multi-objective optimization into a single objective through weighted sum, which limits their ability to handle competing design requirements. Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). This approach explicitly assigns these inherently conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each operating under distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that TDPNavigator-Placer delivers a significantly improved Pareto front over state-of-the-art methods, enabling more balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance.

### [255] [Time-TK: A Multi-Offset Temporal Interaction Framework Combining Transformer and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11190)
*Fan Zhang,Shiming Fan,Hua Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for time series forecasting called Multi-Offset Time Embedding (MOTE) to address the limitations of standard token embedding, and proposes a forecasting architecture named Time-TK. Extensive experiments show significant improvements in prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for time series forecasting rely on embedding each time step as an independent token, which disrupts the important multi-offset temporal correlation within sequences, weakening long sequence processing and forecasting accuracy.

Method: The paper develops Multi-Offset Time Embedding (MOTE) to improve sequence representation by preserving fine-grained dependencies across time steps. This is integrated into a novel forecasting architecture, Time-TK, which uses Multi-Offset Interactive Kernels and Temporal Interaction mechanisms for enhanced global dependency capturing.

Result: Time-TK achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, as validated through extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets across domains such as traffic flow and cryptocurrency throughput.

Conclusion: The proposed MOTE and Time-TK architecture address crucial bottlenecks in time series forecasting by preserving multi-offset temporal correlation, offering a universally applicable and highly accurate approach for various real-world applications.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for the World Wide Web and represents a core technical challenge in ensuring the stable and efficient operation of modern web services, such as intelligent transportation and website throughput. However, we have found that existing methods typically employ a strategy of embedding each time step as an independent token. This paradigm introduces a fundamental information bottleneck when processing long sequences, the root cause of which is that independent token embedding destroys a crucial structure within the sequence - what we term as multi-offset temporal correlation. This refers to the fine-grained dependencies embedded within the sequence that span across different time steps, which is especially prevalent in regular Web data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a new perspective on time series embedding. We provide an upper bound on the approximate reconstruction performance of token embedding, which guides our design of a concise yet effective Multi-Offset Time Embedding method to mitigate the performance degradation caused by standard token embedding. Furthermore, our MOTE can be integrated into various existing models and serve as a universal building block. Based on this paradigm, we further design a novel forecasting architecture named Time-TK. This architecture first utilizes a Multi-Offset Interactive KAN to learn and represent specific temporal patterns among multiple offset sub-sequences. Subsequently, it employs an efficient Multi-Offset Temporal Interaction mechanism to effectively capture the complex dependencies between these sub-sequences, achieving global information integration. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmark datasets, covering domains such as traffic flow and BTC/USDT throughput, demonstrate that Time-TK significantly outperforms all baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy.

*Arian Raje,Anupam Nayak,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MELINOE fine-tunes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to activate fewer experts, reducing CPU-GPU transfer overhead and improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory bottlenecks in resource-constrained settings caused by the large parameter counts of MoE models, which require all parameters to be loaded in GPU memory.

Method: MELINOE fine-tunes MoE models to activate fewer experts by caching preferred experts in GPU memory, reducing I/O latency and transfers between CPU and GPU.

Result: MELINOE improves throughput by 1.2-3× over efficient baselines and up to 14.7× over transfer-heavy baselines, while maintaining or enhancing model performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MELINOE presents a reliable and efficient method to improve the inference efficiency of MoE models in memory-constrained environments.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model architectures can significantly reduce the number of activated parameters per token, enabling computationally efficient training and inference. However, their large overall parameter counts and model sizes have precluded their widespread usage in resource-constrained settings as all of the parameters must still be loaded into GPU memory. Prior works aim to address this memory bottleneck by offloading certain experts into CPU memory and porting them to GPU memory only when they are activated. In practice, these methods suffer from the significant I/O latency incurred by expert transfer. We present MELINOE, a method that fine-tunes an MoE model to more strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence. Caching these preferred experts in GPU memory reduces expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead. MELINOE increases throughput by $1.2-3\times$ over efficient baselines and up to $14.7\times$ over transfer-heavy baselines while retaining or even improving the performance of the model on a downstream task, making it a reliable method for improving MoE inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in existing data formats for deep learning by developing a format that maximizes representational space utilization while lowering hardware requirements.

Method: The method involves creating a 4.5-bit HiF4 format with 32 bits of scaling metadata packed in a 64-element group, including a three-level scaling hierarchy. This allows for efficient matrix multiplications and optimization of hardware area and power.

Result: HiF4 outperforms NVFP4 format in accuracy across various language models and downstream tasks while achieving hardware efficiency.

Conclusion: HiF4 is a superior data format for deep learning, offering both accuracy improvements and substantial hardware cost reductions, making it a valuable advancement in this domain.

Abstract: This paper introduces HiFloat4 (HiF4), a block floating-point data format tailored for deep learning. Each HiF4 unit packs 64 4-bit elements with 32 bits of shared scaling metadata, averaging 4.5 bits per value. The metadata specifies a three-level scaling hierarchy, capturing inter- and intra-group dynamic range while improving the utilization of the representational space. In addition, the large 64-element group size enables matrix multiplications to be executed in a highly fixed-point manner, significantly reducing hardware area and power consumption. To evaluate the proposed format, we conducted inference experiments on several language models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek-V3.1 and LongCat. Results show that HiF4 achieves higher average accuracy than the state-of-the-art NVFP4 format across multiple models and diverse downstream tasks.

### [258] [Predicting the post-wildfire mudflow onset using machine learning models on multi-parameter experimental data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11194)
*Mahta Movasat,Ingrid Tomac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-wildfire mudflows, exacerbated by soil hydrophobicity and rain-induced erosion, are studied using machine learning to predict and classify debris flow conditions. Findings highlight rainfall intensity and soil characteristics as crucial factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the growing hazard posed by post-wildfire mudflows, driven by increasing wildfires and their impacts on soil hydrophobicity, erosion, and debris flows.

Method: Multiple machine learning techniques, including MLR, LR, SVC, K-means clustering, and PCA, were applied to lab-based experiments using different soil types under controlled rainfall and sloped flume conditions.

Result: MLR predicted total discharge effectively but struggled with erosion predictions for coarse sand. LR and SVC classified failure outcomes successfully. Fine sand exhibited high susceptibility under low-intensity, long-duration rain. Initial high-intensity rainfall was critical for flow outcomes.

Conclusion: ML techniques demonstrate strong potential for assessing hazards and aiding emergency response planning for post-wildfire debris flows, emphasizing the role of soil properties and rainfall dynamics.

Abstract: Post-wildfire mudflows are increasingly hazardous due to the prevalence of wildfires, including those on the wildland-urban interface. Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning.

Abstract: Ambient intelligence, continuously understanding human presence, activity, and physiology in physical spaces, is fundamental to smart environments, health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. WiFi infrastructure provides a ubiquitous, always-on, privacy-preserving substrate for this capability across billions of IoT devices. Yet this potential remains largely untapped, as wireless sensing has typically relied on task-specific models that require substantial labeled data and limit practical deployment. We present AM-FM, the first foundation model for ambient intelligence and sensing through WiFi. AM-FM is pre-trained on 9.2 million unlabeled Channel State Information (CSI) samples collected over 439 days from 20 commercial device types deployed worldwide, learning general-purpose representations via contrastive learning, masked reconstruction, and physics-informed objectives tailored to wireless signals.

*Sara Matijevic,Christopher Yau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning regularization framework using bootstrapping to enhance the stability and reliability of clinical prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and lack of reliability in deep learning clinical prediction models, which hinder their clinical adoption.

Method: The study embeds bootstrapping directly into the training of deep neural networks to constrain prediction variability, evaluating the approach on simulations and clinical datasets (GUSTO-I, Framingham, and SUPPORT).

Result: The proposed model displayed improved prediction stability with lower variability across datasets, maintained high discriminative performance, and offered better interpretability compared to ensemble methods.

Conclusion: The method enhances the robustness and interpretability of deep learning clinical prediction models, making them more trustworthy for data-limited healthcare settings.

Abstract: Clinical prediction models are increasingly used to support patient care, yet many deep learning-based approaches remain unstable, as their predictions can vary substantially when trained on different samples from the same population. Such instability undermines reliability and limits clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel bootstrapping-based regularisation framework that embeds the bootstrapping process directly into the training of deep neural networks. This approach constrains prediction variability across resampled datasets, producing a single model with inherent stability properties. We evaluated models constructed using the proposed regularisation approach against conventional and ensemble models using simulated data and three clinical datasets: GUSTO-I, Framingham, and SUPPORT. Across all datasets, our model exhibited improved prediction stability, with lower mean absolute differences (e.g., 0.019 vs. 0.059 in GUSTO-I; 0.057 vs. 0.088 in Framingham) and markedly fewer significantly deviating predictions. Importantly, discriminative performance and feature importance consistency were maintained, with high SHAP correlations between models (e.g., 0.894 for GUSTO-I; 0.965 for Framingham). While ensemble models achieved greater stability, we show that this came at the expense of interpretability, as each constituent model used predictors in different ways. By regularising predictions to align with bootstrapped distributions, our approach allows prediction models to be developed that achieve greater robustness and reproducibility without sacrificing interpretability. This method provides a practical route toward more reliable and clinically trustworthy deep learning models, particularly valuable in data-limited healthcare settings.

*Zhuxin Lei,Ziyuan Yang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZePAD, a defense system against downstream-agnostic adversarial examples (DAEs) in SSL models, focusing on both robustness and preserving benign performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL encoders are vulnerable to DAEs, which affect downstream performance. Existing methods compromise generalizability or benign performance, requiring a universal defense strategy.

Method: ZePAD employs a dual-branch structure: MPAE-Branch strengthens resistance via adversarial fine-tuning, and BMP-Branch preserves benign performance using local data training. It can detect DAEs through confidence evaluation without specific identification training.

Result: ZePAD demonstrates significant improvements across 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets, achieving up to 29.20% in benign performance and 73.86% in adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: ZePAD offers a generalizable, single-tuning defense mechanism against DAEs, ensuring persistent robustness and eliminating performance trade-offs.

Abstract: The widespread use of publicly available pre-trained encoders from self-supervised learning (SSL) has exposed a critical vulnerability: their susceptibility to downstream-agnostic adversarial examples (DAEs), which are crafted without knowledge of the downstream tasks but capable of misleading downstream models. While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property.

*Eunyeong Cho,Jehyeon Bang,Ranggi Hwang,Minsoo Rhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PASCAL, a phase-aware scheduling algorithm designed to reduce latency and improve Quality-of-Experience for reasoning-based language model deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current serving frameworks for reasoning-based language models with Chain-of-Thought lack phase distinction, causing inefficiencies like increased latency (Time-To-First-Token) and poor GPU memory usage.

Method: The proposed solution, PASCAL, uses a phase-aware scheduling algorithm which prioritizes reasoning phases and implements token pacing and controlled preemption. It combines hierarchical scheduling and dynamic migration at phase boundaries to enhance resource utilization and reduce operational delays.

Result: PASCAL achieved up to 72% reduction in tail Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) while ensuring adherence to service-level objectives (SLOs) in answering phases using benchmarks like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B.

Conclusion: Phase-aware algorithms like PASCAL are pivotal for optimizing performance and user experience in reasoning-based language model deployments under constrained computational resources.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning-based LLMs leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference introduces new serving challenges, as their extended reasoning phases delay user-visible output and inflate Time-To-First-Token (TTFT). Existing LLM serving frameworks fail to distinguish between reasoning and answering phases, leading to performance degradation under GPU memory constraints. We present PASCAL, a phase-aware scheduling algorithm that prioritizes reasoning to reduce TTFT while using controlled preemption and token pacing during answering to preserve Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Our hierarchical scheduler combines instance-level placement with intra-instance execution and enables dynamic migration at phase boundaries to balance load and reduce interference. Across benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, PASCAL reduces tail TTFT by up to 72% while maintaining answering phase SLO attainment, demonstrating the importance of phase-aware scheduling for reasoning-based LLM deployment.

*Xin Ju,Nok Hei,Fung,Yuyan Zhang,Carl Jacquemyn,Matthew Jackson,Randolph Settgast,Sally M. Benson,Gege Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Physics Transformer (APT), a neural operator designed for computational efficiency in simulating Earth's subsurface systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the high computational costs in simulating heterogeneous, high-resolution subsurface systems that involve tightly coupled physical processes across varying time scales.

Method: APT combines a graph-based encoder for local feature extraction with a global attention mechanism to capture long-range effects. It is designed to work on both regular and irregular grids, while also learning directly from adaptive mesh refinement simulations.

Result: APT outperforms existing architectures in subsurface simulation tasks, showcases exceptional super-resolution ability, and supports cross-dataset learning.

Conclusion: APT presents a robust and scalable solution for developing large-scale subsurface models, advancing the efficiency and capability of geoscience simulations.

Abstract: The Earth's subsurface is a cornerstone of modern society, providing essential energy resources like hydrocarbons, geothermal, and minerals while serving as the primary reservoir for $CO_2$ sequestration. However, full physics numerical simulations of these systems are notoriously computationally expensive due to geological heterogeneity, high resolution requirements, and the tight coupling of physical processes with distinct propagation time scales. Here we propose the \textbf{Adaptive Physics Transformer} (APT), a geometry-, mesh-, and physics-agnostic neural operator that explicitly addresses these challenges. APT fuses a graph-based encoder to extract high-resolution local heterogeneous features with a global attention mechanism to resolve long-range physical impacts. Our results demonstrate that APT outperforms state-of-the-art architectures in subsurface tasks across both regular and irregular grids with robust super-resolution capabilities. Notably, APT is the first architecture that directly learns from adaptive mesh refinement simulations. We also demonstrate APT's capability for cross-dataset learning, positioning it as a robust and scalable backbone for large-scale subsurface foundation model development.

TL;DR: MUSE is a framework introduced to streamline binary classification systems by decoupling model scores from decision thresholds, enabling easy recalibration in multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recalibrating decision thresholds is challenging and time-consuming when model score distributions shift due to retraining, particularly in multi-tenant environments where decision boundaries are client-managed.

Method: MUSE implements a dynamic intent-based routing system paired with a two-level score transformation to align model outputs to a stable reference distribution, enabling shared infrastructure and seamless updates.

Result: MUSE has been deployed by Feedzai at large scale, handling thousands of events per second and over 55 billion events annually, providing high availability, low latency, and saving millions in fraud losses.

Conclusion: MUSE enhances model resilience and operational efficiency, enabling rapid updates in multi-tenant environments, promoting adaptive defenses against evolving threats and reducing operational costs.

Abstract: In binary classification systems, decision thresholds translate model scores into actions. Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees. By reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes, MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saving millions of dollars in fraud losses and operational costs.

*Yunchong Song,Jushi Kai,Liming Lu,Kaixi Qiu,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Elastic Memory introduces a scalable memory architecture for transformers aimed at addressing the quadratic bottleneck in attention for long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with scaling to long-contexts efficiently due to quadratic attention costs, necessitating methods for better memory handling while maintaining scalability.

Method: Elastic Memory utilizes the HiPPO framework for online function approximation. It encodes historical sequences into a fixed memory state through compression and introduces polynomial sampling for retrieval.

Result: Elastic Memory surpassed baselines in performance on datasets with contexts of 32k+ across multiple domains, achieving superior memory efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: Elastic Memory offers a promising solution for extending transformer capabilities to long-context tasks, outperforming existing methods in both efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Transformers face a quadratic bottleneck in attention when scaling to long contexts. Recent approaches introduce recurrent memory to extend context beyond the current window, yet these often face a fundamental trade-off between theoretical principles and practical scalability. To address this, we introduce Elastic Memory, a novel memory architecture grounded in the HiPPO framework for online function approximation. Elastic Memory treats historical sequence as samples from continuous signals, applying optimal online compression to encode them into a fixed-size memory state. For retrieval, we propose a flexible \textit{polynomial sampling} mechanism that reconstructs a history summary from this compressed state. Elastic Memory consistently outperformed baselines on long-context (32k+) datasets across three domains. With equal parameters, it beat Memorizing Transformer by 16x memory and outperformed Melodi at all memory sizes, even when Melodi had 30% more parameters. When scaling model size, Elastic Memory stayed ahead of all baselines and was significantly faster than Melodi at 4x size. Furthermore, its decoupled design allows for injecting inductive biases at test-time to boost performance.

### [266] [Learning Conditional Averages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11920)
*Marco Bressan,Nataly Brukhim,Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi,Emmanuel Esposito,Yishay Mansour,Shay Moran,Maximilian Thiessen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalization of the PAC learning framework to predict conditional averages in an instance's neighborhood and provides a complete characterization of its learnability with sample complexity bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by extending PAC learning for scenarios such as explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems, where predicting average labels over neighborhoods, rather than exact target concepts, is essential.

Method: The proposed method entails introducing two novel combinatorial parameters tied to both the concept class and neighborhood system, and uses these parameters to determine learnability and tight sample complexity bounds.

Result: The authors characterize learnability based on the finiteness of the combinatorial parameters and provide sample complexity bounds that are accurate up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: This study extends PAC learning to accommodate conditional averages and highlights the theoretical foundations for understanding learnability in scenarios involving neighborhood-based predictions.

Abstract: We introduce the problem of learning conditional averages in the PAC framework. The learner receives a sample labeled by an unknown target concept from a known concept class, as in standard PAC learning. However, instead of learning the target concept itself, the goal is to predict, for each instance, the average label over its neighborhood -- an arbitrary subset of points that contains the instance. In the degenerate case where all neighborhoods are singletons, the problem reduces exactly to classic PAC learning. More generally, it extends PAC learning to a setting that captures learning tasks arising in several domains, including explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, together with sample complexity bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization hinges on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters, which depend on both the concept class and the neighborhood system, and are closely related to the independence number of the associated neighborhood graph.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrefillShare proposes a method that allows multiple specialized language models to share the computational stage and KV cache for prompt processing, significantly improving efficiency and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize multi-agent systems using large language models by eliminating redundant computations and inter-model interference during the prefill stage, which leads to higher latency and inefficiency.

Method: The approach involves factorizing the language model into prefill and decode modules, freezing the prefill module, and fine-tuning only the decode module, with a routing mechanism that supports shared computation across diverse models in a disaggregated GPU environment.

Result: PrefillShare achieves comparable accuracy to complete fine-tuning across tasks while improving performance metrics, with 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in workloads.

Conclusion: PrefillShare effectively reduces computational redundancy and enables faster, more efficient multi-model processing, making it viable for complex multi-agent tasks leveraging shared large language models.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems increasingly orchestrate multiple specialized language models to solve complex real-world problems, often invoking them over a shared context. This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system. PrefillShare not only matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, but also delivers 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads.

*Lintao Wang,Zhuqiang Lu,Yilin Zhu,Kun Hu,Zhenfei Yin,Shixiang Tang,Zhiyong Wang,Wanli Ouyang,Xinzhu Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates large language models' (LLMs) fine-tuning in multidisciplinary contexts, proposing four empirical laws for optimization and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover learning dynamics of LLMs across multiple scientific disciplines and design effective strategies for cross-domain knowledge synergy.

Method: Using a five-discipline dataset and analyzing various fine-tuning techniques such as full fine-tuning, LoRA, LoRA-MoE, and LoRA compositions.

Result: Defined four empirical laws for fine-tuning: Balance-then-Diversity, Merge-then-Align, Optimize-then-Scale, and Share-then-Specialize, showing their impact on performance and generalization.

Conclusion: These laws serve as guidelines for optimizing multidisciplinary fine-tuning, enabling creation of generalizable scientific LLMs.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance through fine-tuning within individual scientific domains, their learning dynamics in multi-disciplinary contexts remains poorly understood, despite the promise of improved generalization and broader applicability through cross-domain knowledge synergy. In this work, we present the first systematic study of multi-disciplinary LLM fine-tuning, constructing a five-discipline corpus and analyzing learning patterns of full fine-tuning, LoRA, LoRA-MoE, and LoRA compositions. Particularly, our study shows that multi-disciplinary learning is substantially more variable than single-discipline training and distills four consistent empirical laws: (1) Balance-then-Diversity: low-resource disciplines degrade performance unless mitigated via diversity-aware upsampling; (2) Merge-then-Align: restoring instruction-following ability is critical for cross-discipline synergy; (3) Optimize-then-Scale: parameter scaling offers limited gains without prior design optimization; and (4) Share-then-Specialize: asymmetric LoRA-MoE yields robust gains with minimal trainable parameters via shared low-rank projection. Together, these laws form a practical recipe for principled multi-discipline fine-tuning and provide actionable guidance for developing generalizable scientific LLMs.

*Panagiotis Antoniadis,Beatrice Pavesi,Simon Olsson,Ole Winther*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses PLaTITO, a generative molecular dynamics model leveraging auxiliary data to enhance sampling efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization in molecular systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of traditional MD approaches, particularly their computational costs and limited transferability of generative MD models across molecular systems.

Method: The authors introduced PLaTITO, a model incorporating coarse-grained transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) and auxiliary information sources like protein language model (pLM) embeddings and structural embeddings to improve molecular sampling.

Result: PLaTITO demonstrated superior performance in equilibrium sampling for out-of-distribution protein systems compared to existing methods, showing enhanced data efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: The incorporation of auxiliary information significantly improves generative modeling for MD, offering a more efficient and generalized approach to molecular sampling, especially for diverse protein systems.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a central computational tool in physics, chemistry, and biology, enabling quantitative prediction of experimental observables as expectations over high-dimensional molecular distributions such as Boltzmann distributions and transition densities. However, conventional MD is fundamentally limited by the high computational cost required to generate independent samples. Generative molecular dynamics (GenMD) has recently emerged as an alternative, learning surrogates of molecular distributions either from data or through interaction with energy models. While these methods enable efficient sampling, their transferability across molecular systems is often limited. In this work, we show that incorporating auxiliary sources of information can improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics. We find that coarse-grained TITO models are substantially more data-efficient than Boltzmann Emulators, and that incorporating protein language model (pLM) embeddings further improves out-of-distribution generalization. Our approach, PLaTITO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on equilibrium sampling benchmarks for out-of-distribution protein systems, including fast-folding proteins. We further study the impact of additional conditioning signals -- such as structural embeddings, temperature, and large-language-model-derived embeddings -- on model performance.

*Simin Fan,Dimitris Paparas,Natasha Noy,Binbin Xiong,Noveen Sachdeva,Berivan Isik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how language model capabilities transfer from pretraining to supervised fine-tuning, examining various factors like accuracy retention, benchmark reliability, and calibration quality at different model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the dynamics of language model capability transfer between pretraining and fine-tuning stages, which can optimize model development and data curation processes.

Method: The authors analyze accuracy and confidence correlations across diverse data mixtures and model scales to study transfer dynamics, reliability, calibration quality, and scaling behavior.

Result: The findings reveal that transfer dynamics significantly vary based on capability categories, benchmarks, and model scales, showing distinct—and sometimes opposing—patterns between accuracy and confidence.

Conclusion: The results offer insights into the interaction between pretraining decisions and downstream tasks, guiding more effective benchmark selection, data management, and model scaling strategies.

Abstract: Understanding how language model capabilities transfer from pretraining to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is fundamental to efficient model development and data curation. In this work, we investigate four core questions: RQ1. To what extent do accuracy and confidence rankings established during pretraining persist after SFT? RQ2. Which benchmarks serve as robust cross-stage predictors and which are unreliable? RQ3. How do transfer dynamics shift with model scale? RQ4. How well does model confidence align with accuracy, as a measure of calibration quality? Does this alignment pattern transfer across training stages? We address these questions through a suite of correlation protocols applied to accuracy and confidence metrics across diverse data mixtures and model scales. Our experiments reveal that transfer reliability varies dramatically across capability categories, benchmarks, and scales -- with accuracy and confidence exhibiting distinct, sometimes opposing, scaling dynamics. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between pretraining decisions and downstream outcomes, providing actionable guidance for benchmark selection, data curation, and efficient model development.

*Tanmoy Mukherjee,Marius Kloft,Pierre Marquis,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to separate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties using a credal-set framework, achieving better de-correlation and alignment of these uncertainties compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of strong correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in predictive modeling, which blurs their semantic distinction and impacts decision-making reliability.

Method: The method introduces a credal-set formulation where uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions. A Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with disjoint uncertainty heads and non-overlapping gradient paths is employed to separate uncertainties during training.

Result: The approach significantly reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by over an order of magnitude compared to traditional methods, while aligning epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with data ambiguity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively decouples the two types of uncertainties, enhancing their interpretability and reliability in decision-making.

Abstract: Decomposing predictive uncertainty into epistemic (model ignorance) and aleatoric (data ambiguity) components is central to reliable decision making, yet most methods estimate both from the same predictive distribution. Recent empirical and theoretical results show these estimates are typically strongly correlated, so changes in predictive spread simultaneously affect both components and blur their semantics. We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition. Across multi-annotator benchmarks, our approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving the alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity.

*Jihao Andreas Lin,Sebastian Ament,Louis C. Tiao,David Eriksson,Maximilian Balandat,Eytan Bakshy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Empirical Gaussian Processes (GPs), a flexible framework for constructing data-driven priors for GPs, using historical observations to replace traditional handcrafted kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian Process models use handcrafted kernels which require expert knowledge, lack adaptivity to data, and impose restrictive assumptions. Overcoming these limitations is important for enhancing GP performance and flexibility.

Method: The paper introduces Empirical GPs, which estimate mean and covariance functions from historical data rather than relying on parametric kernels. An Expectation-Maximization algorithm with closed-form updates is developed to learn the GP prior across datasets.

Result: Empirical GPs outperform traditional approaches in tasks such as learning curve extrapolation and time series forecasting by better capturing the covariance structures in the data.

Conclusion: Empirical GPs offer a principled and effective approach to constructing GP priors, enabling greater adaptability to data and improving performance in various regression and forecasting applications.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful and widely used probabilistic regression models, but their effectiveness in practice is often limited by the choice of kernel function. This kernel function is typically handcrafted from a small set of standard functions, a process that requires expert knowledge, results in limited adaptivity to data, and imposes strong assumptions on the hypothesis space. We study Empirical GPs, a principled framework for constructing flexible, data-driven GP priors that overcome these limitations. Rather than relying on standard parametric kernels, we estimate the mean and covariance functions empirically from a corpus of historical observations, enabling the prior to reflect rich, non-trivial covariance structures present in the data. Theoretically, we show that the resulting model converges to the GP that is closest (in KL-divergence sense) to the real data generating process. Practically, we formulate the problem of learning the GP prior from independent datasets as likelihood estimation and derive an Expectation-Maximization algorithm with closed-form updates, allowing the model handle heterogeneous observation locations across datasets. We demonstrate that Empirical GPs achieve competitive performance on learning curve extrapolation and time series forecasting benchmarks.

*Jiacheng Wang,Ping Jian,Zhen Yang,Zirong Chen,Keren Liao,Zhongbin Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an RL-based data-rewriting agent to optimize data for fine-tuning large language models, reducing forgetting and improving downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning of large language models often leads to catastrophic forgetting when downstream data has a significant distribution shift, requiring methods to mitigate this issue.

Method: The paper frames data rewriting as a policy learning problem and introduces a reinforcement learning-based agent to generate rewritten datasets that align with QA-style outputs, ensuring diversity and task consistency.

Result: The proposed method achieves comparable downstream performance to standard fine-tuning while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by an average of 12.34%.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can effectively optimize data rewriting processes, enhancing downstream performance and reducing forgetting for large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress, yet adapting them to downstream scenarios still commonly relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent. The agent jointly optimizes QA-style distributional alignment and diversity under a hard task-consistency gate, thereby constructing a higher-quality rewritten dataset for downstream SFT. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves downstream gains comparable to standard SFT while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by 12.34% on average.

*Haolin Liu,Braham Snyder,Chen-Yu Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores offline reinforcement learning with $Q^*$-approximation and partial coverage, addressing theoretical gaps and introducing a general framework for intrinsic complexity analysis. Contributions include improved sample complexity bounds, removal of online dependencies, and learnability analysis in broader settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is rooted in addressing theoretical limitations in offline reinforcement learning settings, specifically whether $Q^ -realizability and Bellman completeness suffice for sample-efficient learning under partial coverage.

Method: The paper introduces a decision-estimation coefficient (DEC)-based framework and employs novel theoretical tools like a second-order performance difference lemma to improve and expand on existing approaches.

Result: Contributions include better sample complexity: $ε^{-2}$ instead of $ε^{-4}$, elimination of additional online interaction requirements, and the first analysis of CQL beyond tabular settings.

Conclusion: Offline RL can benefit from intrinsic complexity frameworks and tools for broader applicability and efficiency, making theoretical advances in partially covered $Q^*$-approximation and non-complete Bellman settings.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning under $Q^\star$-approximation and partial coverage, a setting that motivates practical algorithms such as Conservative $Q$-Learning (CQL; Kumar et al., 2020) but has received limited theoretical attention. Our work is inspired by the following open question: "Are $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage?"
  We answer in the negative by establishing an information-theoretic lower bound. Going substantially beyond this, we introduce a general framework that characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a given $Q^\star$ function class, inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) for online RL (Foster et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2025b). This complexity recovers and improves the quantities underlying the guarantees of Chen and Jiang (2022) and Uehara et al. (2023), and extends to broader settings. Our decision-estimation decomposition can be combined with a wide range of $Q^\star$ estimation procedures, modularizing and generalizing existing approaches.
  Beyond the general framework, we make further contributions: By developing a novel second-order performance difference lemma, we obtain the first $ε^{-2}$ sample complexity under partial coverage for soft $Q$-learning, improving the $ε^{-4}$ bound of Uehara et al. (2023). We remove Chen and Jiang's (2022) need for additional online interaction when the value gap of $Q^\star$ is unknown. We also give the first characterization of offline learnability for general low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness (Jiang et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2021), a canonical setting in online RL that remains unexplored in offline RL except for special cases. Finally, we provide the first analysis for CQL under $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness beyond the tabular case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges primary care physicians face in accurately diagnosing type 2 diabetes and provide a supporting diagnostic tool with high reliability.

Method: Hybrid approach combining expert-driven insights and machine learning techniques was utilized, using features like BMI, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1C. Development included training on 650 and testing on 648 data samples, with a pilot study involving 105 patients.

Result: The system achieved exceptional predictive accuracy for diabetes (99.8%) and high agreement rates with specialists (98.8%). In a pilot study, AI-CDSS outperformed non-endocrinology specialists significantly.

Conclusion: AI-CDSS is highly accurate, showing promise as an effective diagnostic tool for type 2 diabetes, particularly valuable where specialists are unavailable.

Abstract: Identifying type 2 diabetes mellitus can be challenging, particularly for primary care physicians. Clinical decision support systems incorporating artificial intelligence (AI-CDSS) can assist medical professionals in diagnosing type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. This study aimed to assess an AI-CDSS specifically developed for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by employing a hybrid approach that integrates expert-driven insights with machine learning techniques. The AI-CDSS was developed (training dataset: n = 650) and tested (test dataset: n = 648) using a dataset of 1298 patients with and without type 2 diabetes. To generate predictions, the algorithm utilized key features such as body mass index, plasma fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1C. Furthermore, a clinical pilot study involving 105 patients was conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the system in comparison to non-endocrinology specialists. The AI-CDSS showed a high degree of accuracy, with 99.8% accuracy in predicting diabetes, 99.3% in predicting prediabetes, 99.2% in identifying at-risk individuals, and 98.8% in predicting no diabetes. The test dataset revealed a 98.8% agreement between endocrinology specialists and the AI-CDSS. Type 2 diabetes was identified in 45% of 105 individuals in the pilot study. Compared with diabetes specialists, the AI-CDSS scored a 98.5% concordance rate, greatly exceeding that of nonendocrinology specialists, who had an 85% agreement rate.

### [276] [Evaluating Memory Structure in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11243)
*Alina Shutova,Alexandra Olenina,Ivan Vinogradov,Anton Sinitsin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces StructMemEval to benchmark LLM-based agents’ ability in organizing long-term memory rather than simple factual recall, focusing on tasks with specific memory structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for long-term memory in LLMs focus heavily on factual recall or retrieval, failing to test the capabilities to manage complex memory structures.

Method: They propose StructMemEval, comprising tasks like transaction ledgers and to-do lists, which require structured memory organization. Experiments compared retrieval-augmented LLMs and memory agents.

Result: Experiments showed that while retrieval-augmented LLMs struggled, memory agents succeeded with proper prompting. However, without prompts, LLMs fail to recognize memory structures.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of further improving LLMs’ training and memory frameworks to better recognize and utilize structured memory.

Abstract: Modern LLM-based agents and chat assistants rely on long-term memory frameworks to store reusable knowledge, recall user preferences, and augment reasoning. As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others. Our initial experiments show that simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with these tasks, whereas memory agents can reliably solve them if prompted how to organize their memory. However, we also find that modern LLMs do not always recognize the memory structure when not prompted to do so. This highlights an important direction for future improvements in both LLM training and memory frameworks.

### [277] [How Many Features Can a Language Model Store Under the Linear Representation Hypothesis?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11246)
*Nikhil Garg,Jon Kleinberg,Kenny Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mathematical framework to analyze the linear representation hypothesis (LRH) regarding intermediate layers of language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how intermediate layers of language models store and decode features linearly.

Method: The authors base their work on theoretical results in compressed sensing to explore linear representation and linear accessibility, deriving upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing.

Result: They establish nearly-matching bounds and prove exponential storage potential of features under LRH, providing theoretical insights into the 'superposition hypothesis.'

Conclusion: Linear accessibility creates stronger demands than linear representation alone, and the neural framework validates feature storage capabilities based on LRH.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which asserts that intermediate layers of language models store features linearly. We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.
  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = Ω_ε(\frac{k^2}{\log k}\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_ε(k^2\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the "superposition hypothesis" (Elhage et al., 2022).
  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Turán's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias.

### [278] [Efficient Analysis of the Distilled Neural Tangent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11320)
*Jamie Mahowald,Brian Bell,Alex Ho,Michael Geyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to reduce computational complexity for Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) evaluations using NTK-tuned dataset distillation, achieving significant reductions in Jacobian calculations while preserving kernel structure and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address computational inefficiencies in traditional NTK methods, which involve evaluating large Jacobians across many data points.

Method: The authors use NTK-tuned dataset distillation to compress the data dimension and combine this with projection methods to reduce computational complexity while maintaining effective NTK predictions.

Result: The proposed method reduces NTK computational complexity by up to five orders of magnitude and minimizes Jacobian calculations by 20-100 times, while maintaining the kernel's structure and predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: NTK computation can become more practical and efficient through dataset distillation, significantly reducing computational demands without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Neural tangent kernel (NTK) methods are computationally limited by the need to evaluate large Jacobians across many data points. Existing approaches reduce this cost primarily through projecting and sketching the Jacobian. We show that NTK computation can also be reduced by compressing the data dimension itself using NTK-tuned dataset distillation. We demonstrate that the neural tangent space spanned by the input data can be induced by dataset distillation, yielding a 20-100$\times$ reduction in required Jacobian calculations. We further show that per-class NTK matrices have low effective rank that is preserved by this reduction. Building on these insights, we propose the distilled neural tangent kernel (DNTK), which combines NTK-tuned dataset distillation with state-of-the-art projection methods to reduce up NTK computational complexity by up to five orders of magnitude while preserving kernel structure and predictive performance.

*Esha Singh,Dongxia Wu,Chien-Yi Yang,Tajana Rosing,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach to multi-objective combinatorial optimization by framing it as an online learning problem with bandit subproblems, achieving high efficiency and strong theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing multi-objective combinatorial optimization methods, which often fail to balance generality, scalability, and theoretical guarantees.

Method: The approach reformulates the optimization problem into an online learning framework involving position-wise bandit subproblems. The sequential construction is guided by adaptive experts, and the method ensures regret bounds contingent on subproblem dimensionality rather than the size of the combinatorial space.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks showed the method achieved 80-98% of the performance of specialized solvers while being orders of magnitude more efficient than Bayesian optimization. It also outperformed competing approaches in real-world AI accelerator co-design tasks within fixed evaluation budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed bandit optimization framework is an effective alternative to surrogate modeling and offline training, especially for large-scale and multi-objective problems, due to its scalability, efficiency, and robust theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization seeks Pareto-optimal solutions over exponentially large discrete spaces, yet existing methods sacrifice generality, scalability, or theoretical guarantees. We reformulate it as an online learning problem over a decomposed decision space, solving position-wise bandit subproblems via adaptive expert-guided sequential construction. This formulation admits regret bounds of $O(d\sqrt{T \log T})$ depending on subproblem dimensionality \(d\) rather than combinatorial space size. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves 80--98\% of specialized solvers performance while achieving two to three orders of magnitude improvement in sample and computational efficiency over Bayesian optimization methods. On real-world hardware-software co-design for AI accelerators with expensive simulations, we outperform competing methods under fixed evaluation budgets. The advantage grows with problem scale and objective count, establishing bandit optimization over decomposed decision spaces as a principled alternative to surrogate modeling or offline training for multi-objective optimization.

### [280] [Structured Hybrid Mechanistic Models for Robust Estimation of Time-Dependent Intervention Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11350)
*Tomer Meir,Ori Linial,Danny Eytan,Uri Shalit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses estimating intervention effects in dynamical systems, proposing a hybrid model combining mechanistic and data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize outcomes of interventions in dynamical systems such as drug administration in medicine, addressing challenges in robustness and accuracy.

Method: A hybrid model decomposing the system's dynamics into mechanistic (parametric) and data-driven (nonparametric) components; includes pre-training with simulation and correcting using observed data.

Result: The hybrid approach achieved better performance compared to purely data-driven or mechanistic models in out-of-distribution scenarios, such as Propofol injections and pendulum systems.

Conclusion: Hybrid mechanistic-data-driven models have significant potential in optimizing intervention outcomes in complex systems, combining robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Estimating intervention effects in dynamical systems is crucial for outcome optimization. In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections. Results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches, particularly OOD. This work highlights the potential of hybrid mechanistic-data-driven models for robust intervention optimization in complex, real-world dynamical systems.

### [281] [Retrieval-Aware Distillation for Transformer-SSM Hybrids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11374)
*Aviv Bick,Eric P. Xing,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve sequence modeling in state-space models (SSMs) by selectively preserving retrieval-critical Transformer attention heads and distilling the rest into recurrent heads, achieving efficient memory performance while retaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs struggle to compete with Transformers on retrieval-heavy tasks due to difficulties in replicating specific attention head dynamics critical for retrieval.

Method: The authors introduce retrieval-aware distillation, identifying the essential attention heads using synthetic retrieval task ablation and converting the rest into efficient recurrent heads within a hybrid structure.

Result: Preserving just 2% of retrieval-critical attention heads allowed the hybrid model to recover over 95% of the teacher's performance on retrieval-heavy tasks, while significantly reducing memory usage by up to $5$--$6\times$.

Conclusion: Retrieval-aware distillation closes the performance gap between Transformers and SSMs for retrieval tasks, offering a highly memory-efficient alternative to traditional hybrid models.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) offer efficient sequence modeling but lag behind Transformers on benchmarks that require in-context retrieval. Prior work links this gap to a small set of attention heads, termed Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A), which SSMs struggle to reproduce. We propose *retrieval-aware distillation*, which converts a pretrained Transformer into a hybrid student by preserving only these retrieval-critical heads and distilling the rest into recurrent heads. We identify the essential heads via ablation on a synthetic retrieval task, producing a hybrid with sparse, non-uniform attention placement. We show that preserving **just 2% of attention heads recovers over 95% of teacher performance on retrieval-heavy tasks** (10 heads in a 1B model), requiring far fewer heads than hybrids that retain at least 25%. We further find that large recurrent states often compensate for missing retrieval: once retrieval is handled by these heads, the SSM backbone can be simplified with limited loss, even with an $8\times$ reduction in state dimension. By reducing both the attention cache and the SSM state, the resulting hybrid is $5$--$6\times$ more memory-efficient than comparable hybrids, closing the Transformer--SSM gap at a fraction of the memory cost.

### [282] [Toward Adaptive Non-Intrusive Reduced-Order Models: Design and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11378)
*Amirpasha Hedayat,Alberto Padovan,Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies adaptive non-intrusive Reduced Order Models (ROMs) that self-correct and remain predictive even when system dynamics evolve beyond the training regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROMs are commonly limited by their inability to adapt when dynamics change beyond the training data, reducing practical utility. Adaptive ROMs aim to solve this by updating in response to new dynamics.

Method: The authors propose three adaptive ROM formulations: Adaptive OpInf (incremental updates), Adaptive NiTROM (joint optimization of subspace and dynamics), and a hybrid approach combining Adaptive OpInf and NiTROM.

Result: Static ROMs failed under new dynamics while the adaptive methods succeeded. Adaptive OpInf provided robust performance, Adaptive NiTROM achieved high accuracy but depended on initialization, and the hybrid approach was most effective under minimal data or regime changes.

Conclusion: Adaptive, non-intrusive ROMs offer a practical method for maintaining predictive accuracy as system dynamics evolve, but must be transparent in costs and deployment conditions.

Abstract: Projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are often deployed as static surrogates, which limits their practical utility once a system leaves the training manifold. We formalize and study adaptive non-intrusive ROMs that update both the latent subspace and the reduced dynamics online. Building on ideas from static non-intrusive ROMs, specifically, Operator Inference (OpInf) and the recently-introduced Non-intrusive Trajectory-based optimization of Reduced-Order Models (NiTROM), we propose three formulations: Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and a hybrid that initializes NiTROM with an OpInf update. We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries. This work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as the dynamics evolve well beyond the initial manifold.

*Christopher Kverne,Mayur Akewar,Yuqian Huo,Tirthak Patel,Janki Bhimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Weighted Stochastic Block Descent (WSBD) optimizer, which uses a parameter-wise dynamic freezing strategy to alleviate training issues in Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), resulting in faster convergence and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The training of QNNs faces major issues such as computational expense in gradient estimation and optimization landscapes becoming flat (barren plateaus). The paper aims to improve training efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: WSBD implements a parameter-wise dynamic freezing strategy, temporarily freezing less influential parameters based on gradient-derived importance scores to reduce computational load while maintaining the expressive capacity of the QNN.

Result: WSBD demonstrated an average 63.9% faster convergence compared to Adam optimizer for ground-state energy problems in QNNs. This advantage scales with QNN size, and formal convergence proof further validates its effectiveness.

Conclusion: WSBD offers a novel and effective solution to QNN training challenges, enhancing optimization efficacy without compromising expressive capacity. The parameter-wise freezing strategy surpasses traditional layer-wise approaches.

Abstract: The training of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) is hindered by the high computational cost of gradient estimation and the barren plateau problem, where optimization landscapes become intractably flat. To address these challenges, we introduce Weighted Stochastic Block Descent (WSBD), a novel optimizer with a dynamic, parameter-wise freezing strategy. WSBD intelligently focuses computational resources by identifying and temporarily freezing less influential parameters based on a gradient-derived importance score. This approach significantly reduces the number of forward passes required per training step and helps navigate the optimization landscape more effectively. Unlike pruning or layer-wise freezing, WSBD maintains full expressive capacity while adapting throughout training. Our extensive evaluation shows that WSBD converges on average 63.9% faster than Adam for the popular ground-state-energy problem, an advantage that grows with QNN size. We provide a formal convergence proof for WSBD and show that parameter-wise freezing outperforms traditional layer-wise approaches in QNNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with general policy parameterization, focusing on s-rectangular and non-rectangular uncertainty sets. It develops novel methods and algorithms that reduce computation cost, improve sample complexity, and extend results to infinite state spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works on RMDPs focused on tabular policies, which are computationally expensive and lack sample complexity guarantees. This paper aims to address these limitations by proposing methods for general policy parameterization and providing sample complexity guarantees.

Method: The paper introduces entropy-regularized discounted robust MDPs, novel Lipschitz properties for policy parameterization, multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimators, and projected gradient and Frank--Wolfe algorithms for different types of uncertainty sets.

Result: Improved sample complexity bounds for RMDPs, including $	ilde{O}(ε^{-2})$ gradient estimation and algorithms with $	ilde{O}(ε^{-5})$, $	ilde{O}(ε^{-4})$, and $	ilde{O}(ε^{-10.5})$ complexities in different settings. The results extend to infinite state spaces and improve prior bounds in various scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper provides significant advancements in RMDPs by offering computationally efficient methods and solid sample complexity guarantees, particularly for general policy parameterizations and average reward settings.

Abstract: We study robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with general policy parameterization under s-rectangular and non-rectangular uncertainty sets. Prior work is largely limited to tabular policies, and hence either lacks sample complexity guarantees or incurs high computational cost. Our method reduces the average reward RMDPs to entropy-regularized discounted robust MDPs, restoring strong duality and enabling tractable equilibrium computation. We prove novel Lipschitz and Lipschitz-smoothness properties for general policy parameterizations that extends to infinite state spaces. To address infinite-horizon gradient estimation, we introduce a multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimator with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(ε^{-2})$ sample complexity, a factor of $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ improvement over prior work. Building on this, we design a projected gradient descent algorithm for s-rectangular uncertainty ($\mathcal{O}(ε^{-5})$) and a Frank--Wolfe algorithm for non-rectangular uncertainty ($\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ discounted, $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-10.5})$ average reward), significantly improving prior results in both the discounted setting and average reward setting. Our work is the first one to provide sample complexity guarantees for RMDPs with general policy parameterization beyond $(s, a)$-rectangularity. It also provides the first such guarantees in the average reward setting and improves existing bounds for discounted robust MDPs.

### [285] [Sparse Semantic Dimension as a Generalization Certificate for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11388)
*Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why large language models (LLMs) generalize well despite their high parameter counts, proposing the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD) framework to explain it through sparse, low-dimensional representation manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) should overfit due to high parameter counts exceeding training token numbers. Yet they generalize robustly, which calls for a new understanding of generalization mechanics.

Method: The paper introduces the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to measure activation sparsity in models' internal structures. The framework attributes generalization to the sparsity of feature dictionaries rather than parameter counts.

Result: Experiments on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B demonstrate that SSD provides meaningful generalization bounds. It also shows that larger models, like Gemma-2B, learn more compressible and distinct representations than smaller ones.

Conclusion: The SSD framework provides a novel explanation for LLMs' generalization capabilities, suggesting that sparsity and compressibility, rather than parameter size, are key. It also serves as a safety monitor by detecting out-of-distribution inputs through feature explosion signals.

Abstract: Standard statistical learning theory predicts that Large Language Models (LLMs) should overfit because their parameter counts vastly exceed the number of training tokens. Yet, in practice, they generalize robustly. We propose that the effective capacity controlling generalization lies in the geometry of the model's internal representations: while the parameter space is high-dimensional, the activation states lie on a low-dimensional, sparse manifold. To formalize this, we introduce the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), a complexity measure derived from the active feature vocabulary of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's layers. Treating the LLM and SAE as frozen oracles, we utilize this framework to attribute the model's generalization capabilities to the sparsity of the dictionary rather than the total parameter count. Empirically, we validate this framework on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B, demonstrating that our bound provides non-vacuous certificates at realistic sample sizes. Crucially, we uncover a counter-intuitive "feature sharpness" scaling law: despite being an order of magnitude larger, Gemma-2B requires significantly fewer calibration samples to identify its active manifold compared to GPT-2, suggesting that larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures. Finally, we show that this framework functions as a reliable safety monitor: out-of-distribution inputs trigger a measurable "feature explosion" (a sharp spike in active features), effectively signaling epistemic uncertainty through learned feature violation.

### [286] [General and Efficient Steering of Unconditional Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11395)
*Qingsong Wang,Mikhail Belkin,Yusu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient method to guide unconditional diffusion models without relying on gradient computations during inference, ensuring faster controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for guiding unconditional diffusion models require either retraining or computational-heavy gradient guidance, leading to inefficiencies during inference.

Method: The approach leverages two observations: (1) Noise Alignment enables coarse semantic steering early in the generation process without gradients, and (2) Transferable concept vectors allow fixed steering directions to work across timesteps and samples. Recursive Feature Machine (RFM) is used to identify concept directions efficiently.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA verify improved generation accuracy and quality compared to gradient-based methods, alongside faster inference speeds.

Conclusion: The proposed guidance method enhances conditional control of diffusion models with better efficiency and effectiveness, showcasing its applicability for practical use cases.

Abstract: Guiding unconditional diffusion models typically requires either retraining with conditional inputs or per-step gradient computations (e.g., classifier-based guidance), both of which incur substantial computational overhead. We present a general recipe for efficiently steering unconditional diffusion {without gradient guidance during inference}, enabling fast controllable generation. Our approach is built on two observations about diffusion model structure: Noise Alignment: even in early, highly corrupted stages, coarse semantic steering is possible using a lightweight, offline-computed guidance signal, avoiding any per-step or per-sample gradients. Transferable concept vectors: a concept direction in activation space once learned transfers across both {timesteps} and {samples}; the same fixed steering vector learned near low noise level remains effective when injected at intermediate noise levels for every generation trajectory, providing refined conditional control with efficiency. Such concept directions can be efficiently and reliably identified via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM), a light-weight backpropagation-free feature learning method. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA demonstrate improved accuracy/quality over gradient-based guidance, while achieving significant inference speedups.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the forward-backward (FB) representation learning for reinforcement learning (RL), clarifies its training principles, and introduces an optimized method called one-step FB, demonstrating significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore efficient pre-trained representations as priors for RL tasks, particularly addressing the gaps and complexities in the FB learning framework.

Method: The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the FB learning, connects it to other RL concepts, and proposes a one-step FB approach as an alternative to achieve simplified, efficient pre-training.

Result: The one-step FB method achieves errors 10^5 times smaller and improves zero-shot performance by +24% on average in multiple settings and tasks.

Conclusion: One-step FB streamlines unsupervised pre-training in RL, proving to be more efficient and impactful in achieving better representation learning outcomes.

Abstract: As machine learning has moved towards leveraging large models as priors for downstream tasks, the community has debated the right form of prior for solving reinforcement learning (RL) problems. If one were to try to prefetch as much computation as possible, they would attempt to learn a prior over the policies for some yet-to-be-determined reward function. Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice. We draw connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping. Our analysis suggests a simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL that, instead of enabling optimal control, performs one step of policy improvement. We call our proposed method $\textbf{one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB)}$. Experiments in didactic settings, as well as in $10$ state-based and image-based continuous control domains, demonstrate that one-step FB converges to errors $10^5$ smaller and improves zero-shot performance by $+24\%$ on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve click-through rate (CTR) prediction for online advertising platforms like LinkedIn, addressing challenges specific to ads contexts.

Method: CADET uses innovations including context-conditioned decoding, self-gated attention, timestamp-based Rotary Position Embeddings, session masking, and production engineering optimizations.

Result: CADET shows an 11.04% CTR lift compared to LinkedIn's previous model, LiRank, and is actively deployed in the advertising platform.

Conclusion: CADET improves CTR prediction in LinkedIn's advertising platform using advanced transformer-based techniques, demonstrating scalability and real-world effectiveness.

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is fundamental to online advertising systems. While Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) with explicit feature interactions have long dominated this domain, recent advances in generative recommenders have shown promising results in content recommendation. However, adapting these transformer-based architectures to ads CTR prediction still presents unique challenges, including handling post-scoring contextual signals, maintaining offline-online consistency, and scaling to industrial workloads. We present CADET (Context-Conditioned Ads Decoder-Only Transformer), an end-to-end decoder-only transformer for ads CTR prediction deployed at LinkedIn. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a context-conditioned decoding architecture with multi-tower prediction heads that explicitly model post-scoring signals such as ad position, resolving the chicken-and-egg problem between predicted CTR and ranking; (2) a self-gated attention mechanism that stabilizes training by adaptively regulating information flow at both representation and interaction levels; (3) a timestamp-based variant of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that captures temporal relationships across timescales from seconds to months; (4) session masking strategies that prevent the model from learning dependencies on unavailable in-session events, addressing train-serve skew; and (5) production engineering techniques including tensor packing, sequence chunking, and custom Flash Attention kernels that enable efficient training and serving at scale. In online A/B testing, CADET achieves a 11.04\% CTR lift compared to the production LiRank baseline model, a hybrid ensemble of DCNv2 and sequential encoders. The system has been successfully deployed on LinkedIn's advertising platform, serving the main traffic for homefeed sponsored updates.

*Md Rakibul Haque,Vishwa Goudar,Shireen Elhabian,Warren Woodrich Pettine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits the debate on whether complex nonlinear models outperform simple linear ones for time series forecasting, introducing TimeSynth, a framework to better evaluate model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in benchmarks and evaluation protocols that have led to the belief that linear models outperform complex nonlinear models in time series forecasting.

Method: The researchers introduce TimeSynth, a framework that emulates real-world time series properties by generating synthesized signals with features like non-stationarity and periodicity, derived from real-world data. Performance of different model families (Linear, MLP, CNN, Transformers) is tested using unbiased evaluations.

Result: Linear models exhibit systematic bias by oversimplifying signals, whereas nonlinear models, especially Transformers and CNNs, demonstrate better adaptability to complex signals. The framework also unveils robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts.

Conclusion: TimeSynth enables fair and structured evaluation of forecasting methods, showing that nonlinear models are superior in handling complex signal properties, debunking oversimplified equivalence claims between linear and nonlinear models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental tool with wide ranging applications, yet recent debates question whether complex nonlinear architectures truly outperform simple linear models. Prior claims of dominance of the linear model often stem from benchmarks that lack diverse temporal dynamics and employ biased evaluation protocols. We revisit this debate through TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key properties of real world time series,including non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, and phase modulation by creating synthesized signals whose parameters are derived from real-world time series. Evaluating four model families Linear, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, we find a systematic bias in linear models: they collapse to simple oscillation regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Notably, Transformers and CNN based models exhibit slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals compared to MLPs. Beyond clean forecasting, the framework highlights robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts and removes biases of prior benchmarks by using independent instances for train, test, and validation for each signal family. Collectively, TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence.

### [290] [Multi-Level Strategic Classification: Incentivizing Improvement through Promotion and Relegation Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11439)
*Ziyuan Huang,Lina Alkarmi,Mingyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a study on strategic classification focusing on the design of classifier thresholds and their sequential framework rather than optimizing classifier weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of agents manipulating responses in strategic classification through dishonest actions, by designing effective threshold and progression mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-level promotion-relegation framework to design classifier thresholds while accounting for inter-temporal incentives from agents' farsightedness, skill retention, and leg-up effects.

Result: The optimal long-term strategies for agents are characterized, proving that well-designed thresholds incentivize honest improvement and allow agents to reach high levels via genuine efforts.

Conclusion: A mechanism using tailored thresholds can effectively address strategic manipulation by encouraging honest effort, enabling sustained genuine improvement in sequential classification setups.

Abstract: Strategic classification studies the problem where self-interested individuals or agents manipulate their response to obtain favorable decision outcomes made by classifiers, typically turning to dishonest actions when they are less costly than genuine efforts. While existing studies on sequential strategic classification primarily focus on optimizing dynamic classifier weights, we depart from these weight-centric approaches by analyzing the design of classifier thresholds and difficulty progression within a multi-level promotion-relegation framework. Our model captures the critical inter-temporal incentives driven by an agent's farsightedness, skill retention, and a leg-up effect where qualification and attainment can be self-reinforcing. We characterize the agent's optimal long-term strategy and demonstrate that a principal can design a sequence of thresholds to effectively incentivize honest effort. Crucially, we prove that under mild conditions, this mechanism enables agents to reach arbitrarily high levels solely through genuine improvement efforts.

### [291] [Hierarchical Concept Embedding & Pursuit for Interpretable Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11448)
*Nghia Nguyen,Tianjiao Ding,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework, HCEP, which integrates hierarchical structures into sparse coding for better and interpretable concept recovery in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inconsistencies in explanations produced by interpretable-by-design models in image classification, due to the lack of hierarchical consideration in sparse concepts recovery, highlight the need for a more robust approach.

Method: A model called HCEP (Hierarchical Concept Embedding & Pursuit) is introduced, which builds a hierarchy of concept embeddings, employs hierarchical sparse coding for concept recovery, and ensures rooted-path-based identification of correct concepts for an image in the latent space.

Result: HCEP demonstrates improved concept precision and recall compared to baselines, maintains competitive classification accuracy, and achieves superior performance in classification accuracy and concept recovery under limited sample scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating hierarchical structures in sparse coding enhances the reliability and interpretability of image classification models.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are gaining traction in computer vision because they provide faithful explanations for their predictions. In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery. These results show that incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding yields more reliable and interpretable image classification models.

*Jared Levy,Aarti Lalwani,Elijah Wyckoff,Kenneth J. Loh,Sara P. Gombatto,Rose Yu,Emilia Farcas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The research introduces Motion Tape (MT), a cost-effective wearable sensor, and proposes MT-AIM, a deep learning model, to overcome challenges in classifying lower back movements using limited and noisy MT data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Back pain adversely impacts a large population, and remotely monitoring lower back movements is challenging without high-cost sensors. Motion Tape offers an inexpensive alternative but requires analysis innovation due to data limitations.

Method: This paper employs a deep learning pipeline, MT-AIM, which uses conditional generative models to produce synthetic data and incorporates joint kinematics as features to enhance classification accuracy.

Result: MT-AIM successfully overcomes sample size and noise limitations associated with MT data and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in lower back movement classification.

Conclusion: The integration of Motion Tape with MT-AIM demonstrates effective movement monitoring capabilities, paving the way for improved remote analysis and physical therapy recommendations.

Abstract: Back pain is a pervasive issue affecting a significant portion of the population, often worsened by certain movements of the lower back. Assessing these movements is important for helping clinicians prescribe appropriate physical therapy. However, it can be difficult to monitor patients' movements remotely outside the clinic. High-fidelity data from motion capture sensors can be used to classify different movements, but these sensors are costly and impractical for use in free-living environments. Motion Tape (MT), a new fabric-based wearable sensor, addresses these issues by being low cost and portable. Despite these advantages, novelty and variability in sensor stability make the MT dataset small scale and inherent to noise. In this work, we propose the Motion-Tape Augmentation Inference Model (MT-AIM), a deep learning classification pipeline trained on MT data. In order to address the challenges of limited sample size and noise present within the MT dataset, MT-AIM leverages conditional generative models to generate synthetic MT data of a desired movement, as well as predicting joint kinematics as additional features. This combination of synthetic data generation and feature augmentation enables MT-AIM to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying lower back movements, bridging the gap between physiological sensing and movement analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a new method combining implicit neural representations and statistical shape analysis to assess spatially varying uncertainties in anatomical shape evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding of anatomical shape evolution and quantify uncertainties, which is critical in healthcare research.

Method: PRISM integrates implicit neural representations and models the conditional distribution of shapes based on covariates, offering spatially continuous estimates of mean and uncertainties.

Result: PRISM successfully demonstrated robust performance on synthetic and clinical datasets, showing strong applicability and providing meaningful uncertainty analysis.

Conclusion: PRISM offers a unified and interpretable framework for analyzing shape evolution and uncertainties, advancing clinical research methodologies.

Abstract: Understanding how anatomical shapes evolve in response to developmental covariates and quantifying their spatially varying uncertainties is critical in healthcare research. Existing approaches typically rely on global time-warping formulations that ignore spatially heterogeneous dynamics. We introduce PRISM, a novel framework that bridges implicit neural representations with uncertainty-aware statistical shape analysis. PRISM models the conditional distribution of shapes given covariates, providing spatially continuous estimates of both the population mean and covariate-dependent uncertainty at arbitrary locations. A key theoretical contribution is a closed-form Fisher Information metric that enables efficient, analytically tractable local temporal uncertainty quantification via automatic differentiation. Experiments on three synthetic datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate PRISM's strong performance across diverse tasks within a unified framework, while providing interpretable and clinically meaningful uncertainty estimates.

*Kazuki Haishima,Kyohei Suzuki,Konstantinos Slavakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for recovering sparse vectors from linear models with Poisson noise using an innovative operator embedded in the NoLips algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for recovering sparse vectors often face challenges like estimation bias due to classical $l_1$-norm regularization and instability in convergence behavior.

Method: An external division operator defined through Bregman proximity operators is introduced and integrated into the NoLips algorithm, replacing traditional components.

Result: Numerical tests demonstrated more stable convergence and superior performance compared to KL-based methods, particularly in synthetic data and image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the bias and stability issues, providing a robust solution for sparse recovery in Poisson inverse problems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for recovering sparse vectors from linear models corrupted by Poisson noise. The contribution is twofold. First, an operator defined via the external division of two Bregman proximity operators is introduced to promote sparse solutions while mitigating the estimation bias induced by classical $\ell_1$-norm regularization. This operator is then embedded into the already established NoLips algorithm, replacing the standard Bregman proximity operator in a plug-and-play manner. Second, the geometric structure of the proposed external-division operator is elucidated through two complementary reformulations, which provide clear interpretations in terms of the primal and dual spaces of the Poisson inverse problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed method exhibits more stable convergence behavior than conventional Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based approaches and achieves significantly superior performance on synthetic data and an image restoration problem.

*Xuan Yu,Xu Wang,Rui Zhu,Yudong Zhang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMAB-GFN, a framework combining Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) with a combinatorial multi-armed bandit approach to improve sampling efficiency and focus on high-reward solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GFlowNets struggle with excessive exploration in large state spaces, leading to suboptimal results due to over-sampling of low-reward regions.

Method: The authors proposed integrating a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework to restrict GFlowNets to high-reward subspaces while maintaining diversity by exploring different subspaces.

Result: Experimental results showed CMAB-GFN generates higher-reward candidates compared to previous methods across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: CMAB-GFN is an effective solution for improving GFlowNets' efficiency, focusing exploration on high-reward areas without compromising diversity in sampled solutions.

Abstract: As a probabilistic sampling framework, Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) show strong potential for constructing complex combinatorial objects through the sequential composition of elementary components. However, existing GFlowNets often suffer from excessive exploration over vast state spaces, leading to over-sampling of low-reward regions and convergence to suboptimal distributions. Effectively biasing GFlowNets toward high-reward solutions remains a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we propose CMAB-GFN, which integrates a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework with GFlowNet policies. The CMAB component prunes low-quality actions, yielding compact high-scoring subspaces for exploration. Restricting GFNs to these compact high-scoring subspaces accelerates the discovery of high-value candidates, while the exploration of different subspaces ensures that diversity is not sacrificed. Experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that CMAB-GFN generates higher-reward candidates than existing approaches.

*Xuan Yu,Xu Wang,Rui Zhu,Yudong Zhang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model to improve Generative Flow Networks' efficiency in large state spaces by restricting exploration to high-reward subregions, using partitioning and heuristic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative Flow Networks struggle with efficient convergence when applied to large state spaces due to their freedom in exploration.

Method: The introduced model partitions the state space into overlapping subregions, and employs heuristic strategies to guide exploration towards high-reward subregions while preventing time wastage in low-reward areas.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated faster convergence, better candidate reward generation, and improved diversity across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Restricting exploration using state space partitioning and heuristics enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of Generative Flow Networks.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have shown promising potential to generate high-scoring candidates with probability proportional to their rewards. As existing GFlowNets freely explore in state space, they encounter significant convergence challenges when scaling to large state spaces. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes to restrict the exploration of actor. A planner is introduced to partition the entire state space into overlapping partial state spaces. Given their limited size, these partial state spaces allow the actor to efficiently identify subregions with higher rewards. A heuristic strategy is introduced to switch partial regions thus preventing the actor from wasting time exploring fully explored or low-reward partial regions. By iteratively exploring these partial state spaces, the actor learns to converge towards the high-reward subregions within the entire state space. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that \modelname converges faster than existing works on large state spaces. Furthermore, \modelname not only generates candidates with higher rewards but also significantly improves their diversity.

*Suraj Ranganath,Anish Patnaik,Vaishak Menon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of bit allocation across modules compared to total bitwidth in low-bit planning using DINO-WM, observing that allocating bits strategically can enhance efficiency in spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand if the effectiveness of planning under tight precision budgets is influenced more by the total bitwidth or by the allocation of bits across different modules, which is critical for improving the efficiency of spatial reasoning.

Method: The researchers analyze low-bit planning performance using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, conducting experiments under various allocation schemes (uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise) and planner budgets. Results from mixed-bit evaluations are compared for insights into planning under different bit allocation strategies.

Result: The results reveal three distinct performance regimes: 8-bit/6-bit settings perform close to FP16, 3-bit settings break down, while 4-bit settings show sensitivity to bit allocation. Adjusting encoder precision improves planning in 4-bit settings, and budget-conditioned behavior is observed for the transition-sensitive regimes.

Conclusion: Module-aware and budget-aware quantization policies are essential for enhancing spatial reasoning efficiency in low-bit planning, as shown through the sensitivity in bit allocation effectiveness.

Abstract: Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning.

*Diptarka Chakraborty,Kushagra Chatterjee,Debarati Das,Tien-Long Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a streaming model algorithm for fair consensus clustering, requiring only logarithmic memory while achieving efficiency in processing and approximation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior offline fair consensus clustering approaches, which are prohibitively expensive for large-scale applications due to excessive storage of all input clusterings.

Method: Proposes a constant-factor approximation algorithm integrated with a generic framework combining closest fair clustering and cluster fitting, suitable for both streaming and offline scenarios.

Result: Developed an efficient fair consensus clustering algorithm in the streaming setting, applicable to diverse fairness definitions and extended to k-median consensus clustering.

Conclusion: The work advances fair consensus clustering via a memory-efficient streaming approach, ensuring improved approximation guarantees and broader applicability for real-world large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: Consensus clustering seeks to combine multiple clusterings of the same dataset, potentially derived by considering various non-sensitive attributes by different agents in a multi-agent environment, into a single partitioning that best reflects the overall structure of the underlying dataset. Recent work by Chakraborty et al, introduced a fair variant under proportionate fairness and obtained a constant-factor approximation by naively selecting the best closest fair input clustering; however, their offline approach requires storing all input clusterings, which is prohibitively expensive for most large-scale applications.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of fair consensus clustering in the streaming model, where input clusterings arrive sequentially and memory is limited. We design the first constant-factor algorithm that processes the stream while storing only a logarithmic number of inputs. En route, we introduce a new generic algorithmic framework that integrates closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, yielding improved approximation guarantees not only in the streaming setting but also when revisited offline. Furthermore, the framework is fairness-agnostic: it applies to any fairness definition for which an approximately close fair clustering can be computed efficiently. Finally, we extend our methods to the more general k-median consensus clustering problem.

### [299] [Calibrating an Imperfect Auxiliary Predictor for Unobserved No-Purchase Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11505)
*Jiangkai Xiong,Kalyan Talluri,Hanzhao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to estimate consumer 'no-purchase' probabilities despite biased auxiliary predictors by calibrating them using observed transaction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating market size and consumer preferences accurately when 'outside-option' actions—such as buying from competitors or not purchasing—are unobservable in transaction data.

Method: Two calibration methods are proposed: (1) affine regression-based calibration under logit-space miscalibration, and (2) rank-based calibration under a weaker monotonicity condition. Theoretical error bounds and practical numerical experiments support the methods.

Result: Improved estimation of no-purchase probabilities and enhanced assortment decision performance in downstream tasks. Explicit bounds quantify the impact of predictor alignment and utility-learning error on decision outcomes.

Conclusion: Calibration of biased auxiliary predictors enables better handling of missing data to improve market analysis and assortment optimization. Robust extensions facilitate aggregation of multiple predictors.

Abstract: Firms typically cannot observe key consumer actions: whether customers buy from a competitor, choose not to buy, or even fully consider the firm's offer. This missing outside-option information makes market-size and preference estimation difficult even in simple multinomial logit (MNL) models, and it is a central obstacle in practice when only transaction data are recorded. Existing approaches often rely on auxiliary market-share, aggregated, or cross-market data. We study a complementary setting in which a black-box auxiliary predictor provides outside-option probabilities, but is potentially biased or miscalibrated because it was trained in a different channel, period, or population, or produced by an external machine-learning system. We develop calibration methods that turn such imperfect predictions into statistically valid no-purchase estimates using purchase-only data from the focal environment. First, under affine miscalibration in logit space, we show that a simple regression identifies outside-option utility parameters and yields consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities without collecting new labels for no-purchase events. Second, under a weaker nearly monotone condition, we propose a rank-based calibration method and derive finite-sample error bounds that cleanly separate auxiliary-predictor quality from first-stage utility-learning error over observed in-set choices. Our analysis also translates estimation error into downstream decision quality for assortment optimization, quantifying how calibration accuracy affects revenue performance. The bounds provide explicit dependence on predictor alignment and utility-learning error, clarifying when each source dominates. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in no-purchase estimation and downstream assortment decisions, and we discuss robust aggregation extensions for combining multiple auxiliary predictors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified regularization approach to tackle reward hacking and stable optimization challenges in RLHF. This method improves alignment results and stability effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of reward hacking and stable optimization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

Method: A unified regularization approach combining objectives of preventing reward hacking and ensuring stable policy updates through a weighted supervised fine-tuning loss.

Result: The proposed method outperforms RLHF and online preference learning methods, achieving better alignment performance and stability across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The unified approach improves alignment results and implementation complexity, offering superior trade-offs compared to previous strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has advanced alignment capabilities significantly but remains hindered by two core challenges: \textbf{reward hacking} and \textbf{stable optimization}. Current solutions independently address these issues through separate regularization strategies, specifically a KL-divergence penalty against a supervised fine-tuned model ($π_0$) to mitigate reward hacking, and policy ratio clipping towards the current policy ($π_t$) to promote stable alignment. However, the implicit trade-off arising from simultaneously regularizing towards both $π_0$ and $π_t$ remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce a unified regularization approach that explicitly balances the objectives of preventing reward hacking and maintaining stable policy updates. Our simple yet principled alignment objective yields a weighted supervised fine-tuning loss with a superior trade-off, which demonstrably improves both alignment results and implementation complexity. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate that our method consistently outperforms RLHF and online preference learning methods, achieving enhanced alignment performance and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the temporal credit assignment problem in long-horizon tasks of Mobile GUI Agents, caused by trade-offs between reward fidelity (outcome reward sparsity) and reward density (process reward biases).

Method: ADMIRE anchors actions to adaptive milestones dynamically distilled from successful explorations and uses an asymmetric credit assignment strategy to improve trajectory feedback.

Result: ADMIRE demonstrated over 10% improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld and showed strong performance across diverse RL tasks and environments.

Conclusion: ADMIRE effectively balances reward fidelity and density in RL, making it broadly applicable across diverse environments and tasks with improved success rates.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for training Mobile GUI Agents, yet it struggles with the temporal credit assignment problem inherent in long-horizon tasks. A primary challenge lies in the trade-off between reward fidelity and density: outcome reward offers high fidelity but suffers from signal sparsity, while process reward provides dense supervision but remains prone to bias and reward hacking. To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADMIRE consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld. Moreover, the method exhibits robust generalizability, achieving strong performance across diverse RL algorithms and heterogeneous environments such as web navigation and embodied tasks.

*Zhihang Yuan,Zhiyuan Liu,Mahesh K. Marina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ALTTS, a dual-path framework for multivariate time series forecasting that decouples autoregression and cross-dimension interactions to improve long-horizon predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing models that capture both stable autoregressive dynamics and intermittent cross-dimension interactions in multivariate time series introduces conflicts, degrading model performance over long horizons.

Method: ALTTS utilizes two separate paths: a linear predictor for autoregression and a Transformer with Cross-Relation Self-Attention for cross-relation modeling, coordinated through alternating optimization to reduce gradient noise.

Result: ALTTS outperforms existing methods in multivariate time series forecasting, especially for long-horizon predictions, as shown through extensive benchmark evaluations.

Conclusion: Focusing on tailored optimization strategies, rather than increasingly elaborate architectures, can significantly improve multivariate time series forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves two qualitatively distinct factors: (i) stable within-series autoregressive (AR) dynamics, and (ii) intermittent cross-dimension interactions that can become spurious over long horizons. We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting. Overall, our results suggest that carefully designed optimization strategies, rather than ever more complex architectures, can be a key driver of progress in multivariate time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Krause Attention, a mechanism that addresses synchronization issues in Transformers by replacing global aggregation with localized sparse interactions, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers rely on global softmax weights that lead to representation collapse and attention sink, limiting their efficiency and scalability.

Method: The study proposes Krause Attention, inspired by bounded-confidence dynamics, which uses localized sparse interactions instead of global normalization and reduces computational complexity.

Result: Krause Attention improves runtime efficiency (linear complexity) and enhances performance in tasks across vision models, autoregressive generation, and large language models.

Conclusion: Localized and bounded-confidence dynamics in attention mechanisms present scalable inductive biases, optimizing performance and reducing computational costs effectively.

Abstract: Self-attention in Transformers relies on globally normalized softmax weights, causing all tokens to compete for influence at every layer. When composed across depth, this interaction pattern induces strong synchronization dynamics that favor convergence toward a dominant mode, a behavior associated with representation collapse and attention sink phenomena. We introduce Krause Attention, a principled attention mechanism inspired by bounded-confidence consensus dynamics. Krause Attention replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions, promoting structured local synchronization instead of global mixing. We relate this behavior to recent theory modeling Transformer dynamics as interacting particle systems, and show how bounded-confidence interactions naturally moderate attention concentration and alleviate attention sinks. Restricting interactions to local neighborhoods also reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. Experiments across vision (ViT on CIFAR/ImageNet), autoregressive generation (MNIST/CIFAR-10), and large language models (Llama/Qwen) demonstrate consistent gains with substantially reduced computation, highlighting bounded-confidence dynamics as a scalable and effective inductive bias for attention.

*Luis Olmos,Rashida Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes two proactive anomaly detection frameworks (FFM and BRM) combining advanced neural network techniques to handle multivariate data and timely detect anomalies before failures occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reactive anomaly detection methods are inadequate for applications needing timely intervention, and existing proactive methods struggle with heterogeneity, precision, and noise.

Method: The paper develops FFM and BRM using hybrid architectures combining TCNs, GRUs, and Transformer encoders to model temporal dynamics and proactively detect anomalies based on error metrics.

Result: Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that FFM and BRM outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and timeliness of anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks improve anomaly anticipation and are suited for time-sensitive applications, demonstrating robustness in real-world and multivariate scenarios.

Abstract: Reactive anomaly detection methods, which are commonly deployed to identify anomalies after they occur based on observed deviations, often fall short in applications that demand timely intervention, such as industrial monitoring, finance, and cybersecurity. Proactive anomaly detection, by contrast, aims to detect early warning signals before failures fully manifest, but existing methods struggle with handling heterogeneous multivariate data and maintaining precision under noisy or unpredictable conditions. In this work, we introduce two proactive anomaly detection frameworks: the Forward Forecasting Model (FFM) and the Backward Reconstruction Model (BRM). Both models leverage a hybrid architecture combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Transformer encoders to model directional temporal dynamics. FFM forecasts future sequences to anticipate disruptions, while BRM reconstructs recent history from future context to uncover early precursors. Anomalies are flagged based on forecasting error magnitudes and directional embedding discrepancies. Our models support both continuous and discrete multivariate features, enabling robust performance in real-world settings. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, MSL, SMAP, SMD, and PSM, demonstrate that FFM and BRM outperform state-of-the-art baselines across detection metrics and significantly improve the timeliness of anomaly anticipation. These properties make our approach well-suited for deployment in time-sensitive domains requiring proactive monitoring.

*Yuanfu Wang,Zhixuan Liu,Xiangtian Li,Chaochao Lu,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new training framework called NRT (Native Reasoning Training) that avoids dependency on high-quality human-annotated reasoning data and external verifiers by enabling models to generate their own reasoning traces using standard question-answer pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current model training methods depend heavily on human-annotated data and external verifiers, causing high costs, biases, and limitations in applicable task domains.

Method: NRT frames reasoning as a latent variable, optimizing training with a unified objective that rewards reasoning paths leading to the correct answer. It removes the dependency on expert data and creates a feedback loop to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: Empirical analysis shows that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, outperforming traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches and prior RL techniques in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: NRT is a robust, scalable method for training advanced reasoning systems without reliance on external verifiers or costly human-annotated data, expanding the applicability of reasoning models to complex domains.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for training large reasoning models--combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)--is fundamentally constrained by its reliance on high-quality, human-annotated reasoning data and external verifiers. This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods. Our approach yields particularly strong performance gains in complex reasoning domains and exhibits high robustness to policy collapse, offering a general, scalable path toward building more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems.

*Sisuo Lyu,Siru Zhong,Tiegang Chen,Weilin Ruan,Qingxiang Liu,Taiqiang Lv,Qingsong Wen,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the adaptation challenge for Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) under distribution shift by introducing TS-Memory, a memory adapter that combines high efficiency with improved forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome issues with existing TSFM adaptation methods: catastrophic forgetting and high inference latency, enabling efficient and effective adaptation under distribution shifts.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage training method for TS-Memory: (1) constructing a kNN teacher to generate confident quantile targets, and (2) distilling this into a memory adapter via confidence-gated supervision, allowing retrieval-free deployment.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that TS-Memory consistently improves both point and probabilistic forecasts across benchmarks, achieving efficiency similar to the frozen backbone.

Conclusion: TS-Memory effectively adapts TSFMs to downstream domains under distribution shift, balancing performance improvement and inference efficiency without requiring datastore search.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) achieve strong zero-shot forecasting through large-scale pre-training, but adapting them to downstream domains under distribution shift remains challenging. Existing solutions face a trade-off: Parametric Adaptation can cause catastrophic forgetting and requires costly multi-domain maintenance, while Non-Parametric Retrieval improves forecasts but incurs high inference latency due to datastore search. We propose Parametric Memory Distillation and implement it as TS-Memory, a lightweight memory adapter that augments frozen TSFMs. TS-Memory is trained in two stages. First, we construct an offline, leakage-safe kNN teacher that synthesizes confidence-aware quantile targets from retrieved futures. Second, we distill this retrieval-induced distributional correction into a lightweight memory adapter via confidence-gated supervision. During inference, TS-Memory fuses memory and backbone predictions with constant-time overhead, enabling retrieval-free deployment. Experiments across diverse TSFMs and benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both point and probabilistic forecasting over representative adaptation methods, with efficiency comparable to the frozen backbone.

### [307] [The Implicit Bias of Steepest Descent with Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11557)
*Jichu Li,Xuan Tang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction in mini-batch stochastic steepest descent affect its optimization, particularly in multi-class classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implicit bias and convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent under various configurations.

Method: Unified theoretical analysis of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent under entry-wise and Schatten-p norms, considering factors like batch size, momentum, and variance reduction.

Result: Revealed batch-size, momentum, and variance reduction trade-offs on convergence rates and implicit bias; fully explicit, dimension-free rates were provided.

Conclusion: The paper offers insights on how stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, while highlighting key limitations and trade-offs in optimization methods.

Abstract: A variety of widely used optimization methods like SignSGD and Muon can be interpreted as instances of steepest descent under different norm-induced geometries. In this work, we study the implicit bias of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification, characterizing how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction shape the limiting max-margin behavior and convergence rates under general entry-wise and Schatten-$p$ norms. We show that without momentum, convergence only occurs with large batches, yielding a batch-dependent margin gap but the full-batch convergence rate. In contrast, momentum enables small-batch convergence through a batch-momentum trade-off, though it slows convergence. This approach provides fully explicit, dimension-free rates that improve upon prior results. Moreover, we prove that variance reduction can recover the exact full-batch implicit bias for any batch size, albeit at a slower convergence rate. Finally, we further investigate the batch-size-one steepest descent without momentum, and reveal its convergence to a fundamentally different bias via a concrete data example, which reveals a key limitation of purely stochastic updates. Overall, our unified analysis clarifies when stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, and paves the way for perform deeper explorations of the training behavior of stochastic gradient steepest descent algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of unified evaluation in Brain Foundation Models (BFMs) by introducing Brain4FMs, a standardized platform for assessing BFMs using 15 models and 18 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the gap in unified understanding and evaluation frameworks for BFMs, enabling better scalability and transferable learning in neuroscience.

Method: The authors organized BFMs using a Self-Supervised Learning taxonomy, summarized tasks/datasets, and created a tool, Brain4FMs, for standard evaluations integrating models and datasets.

Result: Brain4FMs highlighted how factors like pretraining data and SSL strategies influence BFMs' generalization and performance. It provides a robust base for analysis and comparison.

Conclusion: Brain4FMs supports progress in neuroscience by offering a unified platform, guiding improvements in accuracy and transferability of BFMs across varied datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Brain Foundation Models (BFMs) are transforming neuroscience by enabling scalable and transferable learning from neural signals, advancing both clinical diagnostics and cutting-edge neuroscience exploration. Their emergence is powered by large-scale clinical recordings, particularly electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, which provide rich temporal and spatial representations of brain dynamics. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the field lacks a unified understanding of existing methodologies and a standardized evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we map the benchmark design space along two axes: (i) from the model perspective, we organize BFMs under a self-supervised learning (SSL) taxonomy; and (ii) from the dataset perspective, we summarize common downstream tasks and curate representative public datasets across clinical and human-centric neurotechnology applications. Building on this consolidation, we introduce Brain4FMs, an open evaluation platform with plug-and-play interfaces that integrates 15 representative BFMs and 18 public datasets. It enables standardized comparisons and analysis of how pretraining data, SSL strategies, and architectures affect generalization and downstream performance, guiding more accurate and transferable BFMs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Brain4FMs-85B8.

*Yujie Gu,Richeng Jin,Zhaoyang Zhang,Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effect of gradient compression in federated learning and proposes an algorithm, FedSynSAM, to address the challenges it poses under non-IID data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem that gradient compression, while enhancing communication efficiency in federated learning, leads to sharper loss landscapes and negatively impacts generalization, especially on non-IID data.

Method: The paper proposes FedSynSAM, which constructs synthetic data using the global model trajectory to improve the estimation of global perturbation, overcoming the limitations of SAM and other methods in federated learning.

Result: The proposed algorithm shows improved convergence and performance compared to existing methods, as validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FedSynSAM effectively mitigates the challenges of gradient compression and improves the generalization capability in federated learning under non-IID data distributions.

Abstract: It is commonly believed that gradient compression in federated learning (FL) enjoys significant improvement in communication efficiency with negligible performance degradation. In this paper, we find that gradient compression induces sharper loss landscapes in federated learning, particularly under non-IID data distributions, which suggests hindered generalization capability. The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate. However, its effectiveness is hindered when model update compression is incorporated. In this paper, we propose FedSynSAM, which leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data and facilitates an accurate estimation of the global perturbation. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate its effectiveness.

*Yair Schiff,Omer Belhasin,Roy Uziel,Guanghan Wang,Marianne Arriola,Gilad Turok,Michael Elad,Volodymyr Kuleshov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework named Progressive Self-Correction (ProSeCo) is proposed to improve sample quality in masked diffusion models (MDMs) by allowing iterative refinement and error correction in token generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of masked diffusion models (MDMs) where fixed tokens result in error accumulation, degrading sample quality.

Method: ProSeCo is introduced as a framework where a model is trained to perform unmasking and correction simultaneously. It reuses outputs from the MDM's denoising network for corrector training. During generation, corrective refinement steps are applied between unmasking steps.

Result: ProSeCo achieves better quality-efficiency trade-offs (up to ~2-3x faster sampling) and enhances sample quality (up to ~1.3x improvement on benchmarks) while supporting compute scaling during inference.

Conclusion: ProSeCo demonstrates improved effectiveness over traditional MDMs by enabling iterative refinement of generated sequences, making it a significant advancement for enhancing the performance of masked diffusion models.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models, enabling parallel token generation while achieving competitive performance. Despite these advantages, MDMs face a fundamental limitation: once tokens are unmasked, they remain fixed, leading to error accumulation and ultimately degrading sample quality. We address this by proposing a framework that trains a model to perform both unmasking and correction. By reusing outputs from the MDM denoising network as inputs for corrector training, we train a model to recover from potential mistakes. During generation we apply additional corrective refinement steps between unmasking ones in order to change decoded tokens and improve outputs. We name our training and sampling method Progressive Self-Correction (ProSeCo) for its unique ability to iteratively refine an entire sequence, including already generated tokens. We conduct extensive experimental validation across multiple conditional and unconditional tasks, demonstrating that ProSeCo yields better quality-efficiency trade-offs (up to ~2-3x faster sampling) and enables inference-time compute scaling to further increase sample quality beyond standard MDMs (up to ~1.3x improvement on benchmarks).

*Naveen Sahi,Jeremy Dohmann,Armen Aghajanyan,Akshat Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SkillRater, a multidimensional data filtering framework designed to optimize model training by decomposing quality into specialized raters for distinct capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data curation methods rely on single quality scores, limiting their effectiveness in training models requiring multiple skill sets.

Method: SkillRater uses meta-learning to train specialized raters for distinct capabilities, and progressively selects samples during training based on individual rater thresholds.

Result: SkillRater achieves notable improvements on visual understanding (+5.63%), OCR (+2.00%), and STEM reasoning (+3.53%) benchmarks with 2B parameter models.

Conclusion: The multidimensional decomposition effectively enhances training by capturing independent quality dimensions, outperforming single-scorer methods and unfiltered baselines.

Abstract: Data curation methods typically assign samples a single quality score. We argue this scalar framing is fundamentally limited: when training requires multiple distinct capabilities, a monolithic scorer cannot maximize useful signals for all of them simultaneously. Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks. The learned rater signals are near orthogonal, confirming that the decomposition captures genuinely independent quality dimensions and explaining why it outperforms both unfiltered training and monolithic learned filtering.

*Tatsuya Sagawa,Ryosuke Kojima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLMs improved pretraining results but limited success in downstream tasks with increasing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the assumption that increasing training resources improves pretraining loss and downstream task performance for molecular prediction.

Method: Pretraining CLMs while scaling training resources and measuring transfer performance across molecular property prediction tasks.

Result: Increasing training resources decreases pretraining loss but provides limited improvement in downstream tasks. Novel metrics fail to estimate downstream performance.

Conclusion: There is a disconnect between pretraining metrics and downstream performance, necessitating task-specific model selection strategies.

Abstract: Chemical Language Models (CLMs) pre-trained on large scale molecular data are widely used for molecular property prediction. However, the common belief that increasing training resources such as model size, dataset size, and training compute improves both pretraining loss and downstream task performance has not been systematically validated in the chemical domain. In this work, we evaluate this assumption by pretraining CLMs while scaling training resources and measuring transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. We find that while pretraining loss consistently decreases with increased training resources, downstream task performance shows limited improvement. Moreover, alternative metrics based on the Hessian or loss landscape also fail to estimate downstream performance in CLMs. We further identify conditions under which downstream performance saturates or degrades despite continued improvements in pretraining metrics, and analyze the underlying task dependent failure modes through parameter space visualizations. These results expose a gap between pretraining based evaluation and downstream performance, and emphasize the need for model selection and evaluation strategies that explicitly account for downstream task characteristics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of probabilistic values for ranking features in decision trees, proposing optimized methods such as TreeGrad, TreeGrad-Ranker, and TreeGrad-Shap for improved performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature ranking methods for explaining local predictions of decision trees, addressing the limitations of standard probabilistic values.

Method: The authors propose new algorithms: TreeGrad computes gradients efficiently, TreeGrad-Ranker optimizes joint objectives for feature ranking, and TreeGrad-Shap enhances computational stability for Shapley values.

Result: Probabilistic values were shown to be unreliable for joint optimization, while TreeGrad-Ranker excelled empirically in feature ranking using insertion/deletion metrics. TreeGrad-Shap vastly reduces numerical errors compared to Linear TreeShap.

Conclusion: TreeGrad-based methods improve feature ranking reliability and computational efficiency while overcoming limitations of probabilistic values, providing a robust explanation framework for decision trees.

Abstract: We revisit the use of probabilistic values, which include the well-known Shapley and Banzhaf values, to rank features for explaining the local predicted values of decision trees. The quality of feature rankings is typically assessed with the insertion and deletion metrics. Empirically, we observe that co-optimizing these two metrics is closely related to a joint optimization that selects a subset of features to maximize the local predicted value while minimizing it for the complement. However, we theoretically show that probabilistic values are generally unreliable for solving this joint optimization. Therefore, we explore deriving feature rankings by directly optimizing the joint objective. As the backbone, we propose TreeGrad, which computes the gradients of the multilinear extension of the joint objective in $O(L)$ time for decision trees with $L$ leaves; these gradients include weighted Banzhaf values. Building upon TreeGrad, we introduce TreeGrad-Ranker, which aggregates the gradients while optimizing the joint objective to produce feature rankings, and TreeGrad-Shap, a numerically stable algorithm for computing Beta Shapley values with integral parameters. In particular, the feature scores computed by TreeGrad-Ranker satisfy all the axioms uniquely characterizing probabilistic values, except for linearity, which itself leads to the established unreliability. Empirically, we demonstrate that the numerical error of Linear TreeShap can be up to $10^{15}$ times larger than that of TreeGrad-Shap when computing the Shapley value. As a by-product, we also develop TreeProb, which generalizes Linear TreeShap to support all probabilistic values. In our experiments, TreeGrad-Ranker performs significantly better on both insertion and deletion metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/watml/TreeGrad.

TL;DR: ArGEnT introduces a Transformer-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains, improving generalization and accuracy in scientific applications spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and electrochemical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of creating surrogate models that generalize across variable geometries and parametric settings in scientific problems, particularly for applications like design optimization and control.

Method: The proposed ArGEnT architecture utilizes Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometrical information from point-cloud representations through self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention strategies.

Result: ArGEnT significantly improves prediction accuracy and generalization compared to standard DeepONet and other geometry-aware surrogates, demonstrating its efficacy across benchmark problems in various scientific domains.

Conclusion: ArGEnT provides an efficient framework by integrating geometry encoding and operator-learning capabilities, enabling scalable surrogate modeling for complex physical systems.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries and parametric physical settings is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. In many-query regimes such as design optimization, control and inverse problems, surrogate modeling must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations. In this work, we propose Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT), a geometry-aware attention-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains. ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features. By integrating ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, we develop a surrogate modeling framework capable of learning operator mappings that depend on both geometric and non-geometric inputs without the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input. Evaluation on benchmark problems spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electrochemical systems, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared with the standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware saurrogates. In particular, the cross-attention transformer variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions. By combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) aids adaptation in graph models and is effective under domain shifts, with GP2F offering improved performance through dual-branch integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of misalignment between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks, particularly in cross-domain scenarios where data distributions differ significantly.

Method: The GP2F method uses a dual-branch structure: a frozen branch maintaining pre-trained knowledge and an adapted branch equipped with lightweight adapters. These branches are fused through topology-constrained losses for effective adaptation.

Result: GP2F achieves superior performance in cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GP2F successfully integrates pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation, providing theoretical and practical advancements in cross-domain graph prompt learning.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation of pre-trained graph models, mitigating the misalignment between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks. Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

### [316] [TIP: Resisting Gradient Inversion via Targeted Interpretable Perturbation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11633)
*Jianhua Wang,Yinlin Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a method to defend against Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) in Federated Learning by introducing selective noise perturbations focused on critical model parameters in the frequency domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to GIAs, which reconstruct private training data, and existing defenses like Differential Privacy compromise model utility and stability. This necessitates a refined approach.

Method: TIP integrates model interpretability (via Grad-CAM) with frequency domain analysis to identify critical convolution channels. High-frequency components in these channels are perturbed selectively, safeguarding private details while retaining primary semantic information.

Result: TIP achieves visually unrecognizable images when attacked by GIAs, preserves model accuracy comparable to non-private models, and outperforms Differential Privacy-based defenses in privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed TIP framework effectively defends against GIAs by selectively perturbing high-frequency data, achieving superior privacy-utility balance and interpretability without significantly degrading model performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training while preserving data locality; however, the exchange of gradients renders the system vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs), allowing adversaries to reconstruct private training data with high fidelity. Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

*Yinlin Zhu,Di Wu,Xu Wang,Guocong Quan,Miao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LG-Plug, a method for better Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in text-attributed graphs by aligning topology and text representations and using an LLM-guided strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods face challenges in detecting OOD nodes in TAGs due to limitations in exploiting semantic content or generating accurate and useful OOD priors. There is a need for a method that leverages both textual and topology-driven features effectively.

Method: LG-Plug aligns topology and text-based representations for detailed embeddings. It uses a clustered iterative prompting approach via LLMs to generate high-quality OOD exposure, employing lightweight heuristics to reduce computational costs. This serves as a regularization to distinguish between ID and OOD nodes.

Result: LG-Plug improves OOD detection by leveraging fine-grained embeddings and LLM-driven OOD exposure generation, integrating seamlessly with existing detection mechanisms.

Conclusion: LG-Plug addresses key limitations in OOD detection for TAGs by combining structural and textual insights through an LLM-guided approach, offering improved detection performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) associate nodes with textual attributes and graph structure, enabling GNNs to jointly model semantic and structural information. While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks. LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. Moreover, it leverages lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling reduce time cost of LLM querying. The resulting OOD exposure serves as a regularization term to separate ID and OOD nodes, enabling seamless integration with existing detectors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proves that UMAP performs spectral clustering on the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor graph and connects UMAP with contrastive learning and spectral clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMAP is widely used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and visualization, yet its relationship with classical spectral methods has not been formally established.

Method: The authors demonstrate UMAP's connection to spectral clustering by showing it involves contrastive learning on a similarity graph and spectral initialization that aligns with spectral clustering objectives.

Result: Theoretical equivalence between UMAP, contrastive learning, and spectral clustering is established.

Conclusion: This work unifies UMAP with established algorithms under a single framework and offers a theoretical explanation for observations about UMAP's behavior.

Abstract: UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is among the most widely used algorithms for non linear dimensionality reduction and data visualisation. Despite its popularity, and despite being presented through the lens of algebraic topology, the exact relationship between UMAP and classical spectral methods has remained informal. In this work, we prove that UMAP performs spectral clustering on the fuzzy k nearest neighbour graph. Our proof proceeds in three steps: (1) we show that UMAP's stochastic optimisation with negative sampling is a contrastive learning objective on the similarity graph; (2) we invoke the result of HaoChen et al. [8], establishing that contrastive learning on a similarity graph is equivalent to spectral clustering; and (3) we verify that UMAP's spectral initialisation computes the exact linear solution to this spectral problem. The equivalence is exact for Gaussian kernels, and holds as a first order approximation for UMAP's default Cauchy type kernel. Our result unifies UMAP, contrastive learning, and spectral clustering under a single framework, and provides theoretical grounding for several empirical observations about UMAP's behaviour.

### [319] [Fully First-Order Algorithms for Online Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11665)
*Tingkai Jia,Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel first-order algorithm for non-convex-strongly-convex online bilevel optimization, avoiding high computational costs from Hessian-vector products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for online bilevel optimization rely heavily on hypergradient descent, which requires computationally expensive Hessian-vector product computations. This work aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: The authors reformulated the bilevel optimization problem into an online single-level problem with inequality constraints and introduced a Lagrangian approach. They then proposed a fully first-order algorithm and its improved variant with adaptive iteration.

Result: The proposed first-order algorithm achieved a regret of $O(1 + V_T + H_{2,T})$, and the improved variant reduced this to $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$, especially excelling when $V_T \geq O(\sqrt{T})$.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a computationally efficient and theoretically sound approach for online bilevel optimization that outperforms existing methods in scenarios with large drift variation.

Abstract: In this work, we study non-convex-strongly-convex online bilevel optimization (OBO). Existing OBO algorithms are mainly based on hypergradient descent, which requires access to a Hessian-vector product (HVP) oracle and potentially incurs high computational costs. By reformulating the original OBO problem as a single-level online problem with inequality constraints and constructing a sequence of Lagrangian function, we eliminate the need for HVPs arising from implicit differentiation. Specifically, we propose a fully first-order algorithm for OBO, and provide theoretical guarantees showing that it achieves regret of $O(1 + V_T + H_{2,T})$. Furthermore, we develop an improved variant with an adaptive inner-iteration scheme, which removes the dependence on the drift variation of the inner-level optimal solution and achieves regret of $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$. This regret have the advatange when $V_{T}\ge O(\sqrt{T})$.

Result: Combining time series with point values improves detection. CNNs achieve the highest accuracy: 77.9% for PFPS, 73.8% for ITBS, and 71.43% for combined injury detection.

Conclusion: Advanced motion capture systems and AI models provide significant potential in identifying running patterns related to knee injuries, enhancing clinical insights.

Abstract: Running is a widely practiced activity but shows a high incidence of knee injuries, especially Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) and Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS). Identifying gait patterns linked to these injuries can improve clinical decision-making, which requires precise systems capable of capturing and analyzing temporal kinematic data.
  This study uses optical motion capture systems to enhance detection of injury-related running patterns. We analyze a public dataset of 839 treadmill recordings from healthy and injured runners to evaluate how effectively these systems capture dynamic parameters relevant to injury classification. The focus is on the stance phase, using joint and segment angle time series and discrete point values.
  Three classification tasks are addressed: healthy vs. injured, healthy vs. PFPS, and healthy vs. ITBS. We examine different feature spaces, from traditional point-based metrics to full stance-phase time series and hybrid representations. Multiple models are tested, including classical algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Processes, Decision Trees) and deep learning architectures (CNNs, LSTMs).
  Performance is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Explainability tools such as Shapley values, saliency maps, and Grad-CAM are used to interpret model behavior. Results show that combining time series with point values substantially improves detection. Deep learning models outperform classical ones, with CNNs achieving the highest accuracy: 77.9% for PFPS, 73.8% for ITBS, and 71.43% for the combined injury class.
  These findings highlight the potential of motion capture systems coupled with advanced machine learning to identify knee injury-related running patterns.

### [322] [ANML: Attribution-Native Machine Learning with Guaranteed Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11690)
*Oliver Zahn,Matt Beton,Simran Chana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the ANML framework for improving machine learning model performance by assigning quality weights to training samples based on factors like data consistency, verification, reputation, and temporal relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI training pipelines treat all samples equally, ignoring differences in data quality. This limits the performance of models trained on specialized expert datasets.

Method: ANML uses four quality factors (gradient consistency, verification status, contributor reputation, and temporal relevance) to produce quality weights for training data. It employs a Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism for consistent performance.

Result: Across five datasets, ANML reduces errors by 33-72% compared to gradient-only baselines. High-quality weighted training data significantly improves performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Quality-weighted data training boosts model performance and efficiency. ANML ensures robustness against strategic attacks and improves contribution-level attribution for subtle data corruptions.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems increasingly train on specialized expert data, from clinical records to proprietary research to curated datasets, yet current training pipelines treat all samples identically. A Nobel laureate's contribution receives the same weight as an unverified submission. We introduce ANML (Attribution-Native Machine Learning), a framework that weights training samples by four quality factors: gradient-based consistency (q), verification status (v), contributor reputation (r), and temporal relevance (T). By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution. Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples), ANML achieves 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines. Quality-weighted training is data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. A Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism guarantees that ANML never underperforms the best available baseline, including under strategic joint attacks combining credential faking with gradient alignment. When per-sample detection fails against subtle corruption, contributor-level attribution provides 1.3-5.3x greater improvement than sample-level methods, with the advantage growing as corruption becomes harder to detect.

### [323] [SpiralFormer: Looped Transformers Can Learn Hierarchical Dependencies via Multi-Resolution Recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11698)
*Chengting Yu,Xiaobo Shu,Yadao Wang,Yizhen Zhang,Haoyi Wu,You Wu,Rujiao Long,Ziheng Chen,Yuchi Xu,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpiralFormer introduces a recursive (looped) Transformer with a multi-resolution recursion schedule to improve efficiency and hierarchy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier looped Transformers struggled in performance compared to equal compute non-recursive baselines and lacked multi-resolution efficiency in latent representations.

Method: The paper designs SpiralFormer, which utilizes a multi-resolution recursion schedule under looped Transformers to specialize iteration at different scales.

Result: SpiralFormer surpasses both looped and non-looped baselines in parameter and compute efficiency across model scales (160M-1.4B).

Conclusion: Sequence resolution offers a promising axis for scaling recursive architectures, demonstrating benefits in efficiency and hierarchical dependency learning.

Abstract: Recursive (looped) Transformers decouple computational depth from parameter depth by repeatedly applying shared layers, providing an explicit architectural primitive for iterative refinement and latent reasoning. However, early looped Transformers often underperform non-recursive baselines of equal compute. While recent literature has introduced more effective recursion mechanisms to mitigate this gap, existing architectures still operate at a fixed, full-token resolution, neglecting the potential efficiency of computing over compressed latent representations. In this paper, we propose SpiralFormer, a looped Transformer that executes recurrence under a multi-resolution recursion schedule. We provide probing evidence that multi-resolution recursion enables the model to learn hierarchical dependencies by inducing iteration-wise functional specialization across different scales. Empirically, SpiralFormer achieves better parameter and compute efficiency than both looped and non-looped baselines across model scales from 160M to 1.4B, establishing sequence resolution as a potential axis for scaling recursive architectures.

*Yongyao Wang,Ziqi Miao,Lu Yang,Haonan Jia,Wenting Yan,Chen Qian,Lijun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabSieve improves tabular prediction by leveraging selected rows as evidence, achieving better performance and robustness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular models often fail to use relevant evidence effectively, and noisy contexts complicate inference.

Method: TabSieve uses a select-then-predict framework to choose informative rows as evidence before making predictions. It includes TabSieve-SFT-40K for training and TAB-GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize evidence selection and prediction.

Result: It shows significant performance gains, improving classification and regression tasks by 2.92% and 4.45%, respectively, over the second-best baseline.

Conclusion: Explicit selection of relevant data improves prediction accuracy and robustness in tabular contexts, offering a reliable framework for handling few-shot evidence scenarios.

Abstract: Tabular prediction can benefit from in-table rows as few-shot evidence, yet existing tabular models typically perform instance-wise inference and LLM-based prompting is often brittle. Models do not consistently leverage relevant rows, and noisy context can degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose TabSieve, a select-then-predict framework that makes evidence usage explicit and auditable. Given a table and a query row, TabSieve first selects a small set of informative rows as evidence and then predicts the missing target conditioned on the selected evidence. To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing. Experiments on a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables show that TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over the second-best baseline. Further analysis indicates that TabSieve concentrates more attention on the selected evidence, which improves robustness to noisy context.

### [325] [Potential-energy gating for robust state estimation in bistable stochastic systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11712)
*Luigi Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for robust state estimation called potential-energy gating, which uses a known potential energy function to improve filtering in double-well stochastic systems, achieving significant RMSE reductions and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of purely statistical or constrained robust filters by introducing a physics-informed approach that leverages the potential energy landscape for more reliable state estimation in double-well stochastic processes.

Method: The authors adapt potential-energy gating within various Bayesian filters including Kalman and particle filters, dynamically modulating observation noise covariance based on the proximity to potential energy minima and barriers. They validate the method through synthetic benchmarks, Monte Carlo simulations, and empirical applications.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates 57-80% RMSE improvement over standard methods in synthetic benchmarks with significant statistical confidence, maintains robustness to parameter misspecification, and performs favorably under noisy and spontaneous transitions.

Conclusion: Potential-energy gating offers a robust and physics-based mechanism for improving state estimation in stochastic systems, outperforming traditional methods and providing insights into real-world phenomena like Dansgaard-Oeschger events with significant variance explained by outliers.

Abstract: We introduce potential-energy gating, a method for robust state estimation in systems governed by double-well stochastic dynamics. The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry parameter gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011], excluding zero) and demonstrating that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement.

### [326] [DICE: Diffusion Large Language Models Excel at Generating CUDA Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11715)
*Haolei Bai,Lingcheng Kong,Xueyi Chen,Jianmian Wang,Zhiqiang Tao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CuKe and BiC-RL frameworks for optimizing diffusion large language models (dLLMs) in CUDA kernel generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the DICE model series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of generating high-performance CUDA kernels using diffusion large language models arises from their specialization and lack of quality training data.

Method: The authors introduce CuKe, a high-quality, fine-tuning dataset, and a BiC-RL framework with two stages: CUDA kernel infilling and end-to-end generation. They also create DICE, a model series with scales at 1.7B, 4B, and 8B.

Result: DICE achieves notable improvements in CUDA kernel generation, surpassing existing autoregressive and diffusion LLMs on KernelBench.

Conclusion: The proposed methods and models overcome challenges in CUDA kernel generation, showcasing both technical advancements and extensive experimental success.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, owing to their capacity for parallel token generation. This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.

### [327] [Dopamine: Brain Modes, Not Brains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11726)
*Shervin Ghasemlou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an activation-space parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, named methodname{}, which introduces trainable neuron thresholds and gains to freeze weights and interpret activation. It performs better on rotated MNIST than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PEFT methods like lora{} involve weight updates that are hard to interpret mechanistically and fail to directly expose reused versus bypassed computations. This motivates developing an interpretable approach for adapting pretrained models.

Method: The proposed methodname{} technique operates in activation space by freezing base model weights and learning neuron-level thresholds and gains. Smooth gates control activation participation during training, which can harden for neuron-level interpretability.

Result: In an experiment adapting a model for MNIST (45° rotation) via methodname{}, the approach uses fewer trainable parameters, achieves accuracy improvements over the frozen baseline with partial activation sparsity, and is more interpretable compared to lora{}.

Conclusion: methodname{} offers a mechanism for interpretable mode specialization by rescaling existing computations rather than rewriting weights. Although it improves parameter efficiency and interpretability, its expressivity is limited when base features are insufficient.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as \lora{} adapt large pretrained models by adding small weight-space updates. While effective, weight deltas are hard to interpret mechanistically, and they do not directly expose \emph{which} internal computations are reused versus bypassed for a new task. We explore an alternative view inspired by neuromodulation: adaptation as a change in \emph{mode} -- selecting and rescaling existing computations -- rather than rewriting the underlying weights. We propose \methodname{}, a simple activation-space PEFT technique that freezes base weights and learns per-neuron \emph{thresholds} and \emph{gains}. During training, a smooth gate decides whether a neuron's activation participates; at inference the gate can be hardened to yield explicit conditional computation and neuron-level attributions.
  As a proof of concept, we study ``mode specialization'' on MNIST (0$^\circ$) versus rotated MNIST (45$^\circ$). We pretrain a small MLP on a 50/50 mixture (foundation), freeze its weights, and then specialize to the rotated mode using \methodname{}. Across seeds, \methodname{} improves rotated accuracy over the frozen baseline while using only a few hundred trainable parameters per layer, and exhibits partial activation sparsity (a minority of units strongly active). Compared to \lora{}, \methodname{} trades some accuracy for substantially fewer trainable parameters and a more interpretable ``which-neurons-fire'' mechanism. We discuss limitations, including reduced expressivity when the frozen base lacks features needed for the target mode.

*Ilya Kuleshov,Alexander Marusov,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UFO (U-Former ODE), a novel architecture for forecasting irregularly sampled time series using U-Nets, Transformers, and Neural CDEs to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting in healthcare and finance is a challenge, especially for irregularly sampled data. Current methods like Neural CDEs lack scalability and global context.

Method: UFO combines U-Nets for parallel, multiscale feature extraction, Transformers for global modeling, and Neural CDEs for continuous-time dynamics into a fully causal and parallelizable model.

Result: UFO achieves superior predictive accuracy over ten state-of-the-art baselines on five benchmarks. It also offers up to 15× faster inference compared to Neural CDEs.

Conclusion: UFO effectively addresses current limitations in forecasting irregularly sampled time series by combining scalability with high predictive accuracy and inference speed.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series is crucial in domains such as healthcare and finance, yet it remains a formidable challenge. Existing Neural Controlled Differential Equation (Neural CDE) approaches, while effective at modelling continuous dynamics, suffer from slow, inherently sequential computation, which restricts scalability and limits access to global context. We introduce UFO (U-Former ODE), a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates the parallelizable, multiscale feature extraction of U-Nets, the powerful global modelling of Transformers, and the continuous-time dynamics of Neural CDEs. By constructing a fully causal, parallelizable model, UFO achieves a global receptive field while retaining strong sensitivity to local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks -- covering both regularly and irregularly sampled time series -- demonstrate that UFO consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art neural baselines in predictive accuracy. Moreover, UFO delivers up to 15$\times$ faster inference compared to conventional Neural CDEs, with consistently strong performance on long and highly multivariate sequences.

*Zhihang Yuan,Leyang Xue,Waleed Ahsan,Mahesh K. Marina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TUBO, a framework enhancing network traffic forecasting, addressing limitations in deep learning methods by incorporating burst processing and model selection, achieving substantial forecasting and traffic engineering improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning models struggle with network traffic’s bursty and complex patterns, leading to unreliable forecasting.

Method: TUBO incorporates burst processing for large traffic fluctuations and model selection using a pool of forecasting models to adapt to diverse patterns. It provides deterministic predictions with uncertainty quantification.

Result: TUBO outperformed existing methods in forecasting accuracy, achieving up to four times better precision and 94% burst occurrence forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, proactive traffic engineering with TUBO markedly increased throughput.

Conclusion: TUBO effectively handles network traffic challenges, showcasing significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and enhancing traffic engineering outcomes.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting based network operation optimization and management offers enormous promise but also presents significant challenges from traffic forecasting perspective. While deep learning models have proven to be relatively more effective than traditional statistical methods for time series forecasting, their reliability is not satisfactory due to their inability to effectively handle unique characteristics of network traffic. In particular, the burst and complex traffic patterns makes the existing models less reliable, as each type of deep learning model has limited capability in capturing traffic patterns. To address this issue, we introduce TUBO, a novel machine learning framework custom designed for reliable network traffic forecasting. TUBO features two key components: burst processing for handling significant traffic fluctuations and model selection for adapting to varying traffic patterns using a pool of models. A standout feature of TUBO is its ability to provide deterministic predictions along with quantified uncertainty, which serves as a cue for identifying the most reliable forecasts. Evaluations on three real-world network demand matrix (DM) datasets (Abilene, GEANT, and CERNET) show that TUBO significantly outperforms existing methods on forecasting accuracy (by 4 times), and also achieves up to 94% accuracy in burst occurrence forecasting. Furthermore, we also consider traffic demand forecasting based proactive traffic engineering (TE) as a downstream use case. Our results show that compared to reactive approaches and proactive TE using the best existing DM forecasting methods, proactive TE powered by TUBO improves aggregated throughput by 9 times and 3 times, respectively.

*Haoran Dang,Cuiling Lan,Hai Wan,Xibin Zhao,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes TAMPO, a framework for adaptive temperature control in LLMs, enhancing exploration and optimization during reinforcement learning by making temperature a learnable meta-policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of static or heuristic temperature schedules in LLMs, which fail to adapt effectively to the varying demands of RL training, by exploring temperature control as a dynamic, learnable process.

Method: The proposed TAMPO framework adopts a hierarchical two-loop process: the inner loop updates the LLM policy with samples from the temperature chosen by a meta-policy, while the outer loop adjusts the meta-policy based on rewards from high-advantage trajectories, enabling efficient online adaptation.

Result: On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, TAMPO surpassed baseline models using fixed or heuristic temperature schedules, demonstrating its effectiveness for adaptive exploration in LLM-based reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Temperature can serve as a learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning, driving improved policy optimization through TAMPO's reward-driven and trajectory-guided mechanisms.

Abstract: Temperature is a crucial hyperparameter in large language models (LLMs), controlling the trade-off between exploration and exploitation during text generation. High temperatures encourage diverse but noisy outputs, while low temperatures produce focused outputs but may cause premature convergence. Yet static or heuristic temperature schedules fail to adapt to the dynamic demands of reinforcement learning (RL) throughout training, often limiting policy improvement. We propose Temperature Adaptive Meta Policy Optimization (TAMPO), a new framework that recasts temperature control as a learnable meta-policy. TAMPO operates through a hierarchical two-loop process. In the inner loop, the LLM policy is updated (e.g., using GRPO) with trajectories sampled at the temperature selected by the meta-policy. In the outer loop, meta-policy updates the distribution over candidate temperatures by rewarding those that maximize the likelihood of high-advantage trajectories. This trajectory-guided, reward-driven mechanism enables online adaptation without additional rollouts, directly aligning exploration with policy improvement. On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, TAMPO outperforms baselines using fixed or heuristic temperatures, establishing temperature as an effective learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning.

*Ainhize Barrainkua,Santiago Mazuelas,Novi Quadrianto,Jose A. Lozano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPECTRE, a method for ensuring fairness in classifiers without requiring group information, by optimizing against constrained worst-case distributions. Extensive experiments reveal improved fairness and performance relative to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated classification systems risk amplifying societal biases, prompting a need for improved fairness methods, especially when demographic group information is unavailable.

Method: The paper proposes SPECTRE, a minimax-fair technique using Fourier feature mapping to constrain deviations in worst-case distributions from empirical ones.

Result: SPECTRE achieves the highest fairness guarantees with low variability across tests on American Community Survey datasets from 20 states, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, including those using demographic data.

Conclusion: SPECTRE effectively ensures fairness without demographic information, supported by theoretical bounds and extensive empirical validation of its safety and robustness.

Abstract: As automated classification systems become increasingly prevalent, concerns have emerged over their potential to reinforce and amplify existing societal biases. In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances

### [332] [Evaluating LLM Safety Under Repeated Inference via Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11786)
*Keita Broadwater*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST) framework to evaluate large language models (LLMs) for response consistency, safety, and reliability under repeated prompt inference, addressing shortcomings of existing safety benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between traditional benchmark evaluations (which assess broad task generalization) and real-world needs for reliability and safety in repetitive use of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST) repeatedly samples the same prompts under controlled conditions (e.g., decoding temperature), uses probabilistic models to quantify safety and response consistency, and evaluates failure probabilities with Bernoulli and binomial models.

Result: Empirical testing using APST reveals that models with similar benchmark scores differ significantly in failure rates under repeated sampling—particularly at higher temperatures—providing a more nuanced view of LLM reliability.

Conclusion: APST complements existing evaluation frameworks by offering a depth-oriented, practical approach to assessing LLM safety and reliability during sustained use, revealing risks missed by traditional evaluations focused on breadth.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess safety risk through breadth-oriented evaluation across diverse tasks. However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment.

### [333] [Latent-Variable Learning of SPDEs via Wiener Chaos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11794)
*Sebastian Zeng,Andreas Petersson,Wolfgang Bock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a latent-variable deep learning framework to learn linear SPDEs with Gaussian forcing from solution observations, addressing limitations of prior work by modeling the stochastic dynamics and deterministic evolution separately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for SPDEs struggle to capture intrinsic stochasticity or require information on the driving noise or initial conditions. This work aims to develop a model addressing these challenges to infer randomly forced dynamics directly from solution observations.

Method: By combining a spectral Galerkin projection with a truncated Wiener chaos expansion, the method separates deterministic evolution and stochastic forcing, reducing SPDEs to finite-dimensional ordinary differential equations. These latent dynamics are inferred through variational learning.

Result: Empirical tests on synthetic data show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for learning SPDEs on bounded and unbounded one-dimensional domains.

Conclusion: This approach enables automatic recovery of stochastic structure in SPDEs without explicit noise observation, innovatively addressing challenges in learning stochastic dynamics from limited data.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the law of linear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with additive Gaussian forcing from spatiotemporal observations. Most existing deep learning approaches either assume access to the driving noise or initial condition, or rely on deterministic surrogate models that fail to capture intrinsic stochasticity. We propose a structured latent-variable formulation that requires only observations of solution realizations and learns the underlying randomly forced dynamics. Our approach combines a spectral Galerkin projection with a truncated Wiener chaos expansion, yielding a principled separation between deterministic evolution and stochastic forcing. This reduces the infinite-dimensional SPDE to a finite system of parametrized ordinary differential equations governing latent temporal dynamics. The latent dynamics and stochastic forcing are jointly inferred through variational learning, allowing recovery of stochastic structure without explicit observation or simulation of noise during training. Empirical evaluation on synthetic data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance under comparable modeling assumptions across bounded and unbounded one-dimensional spatial domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, CIR, for improving the sample efficiency of off-policy RL by constraining initial representations using Tanh activation, among other techniques, achieving competitive results in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance sample efficiency in off-policy RL by addressing the distribution shift issue and stabilizing training through constraints on the initial representations of input data.

Method: The Tanh function is introduced in the initial layer, and the Constrained Initial Representations (CIR) framework is proposed, which includes Tanh activation with normalization, a skip connection module, and convex Q-learning.

Result: CIR outperforms or competes with strong baselines on several continuous control tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: Constraining initial representations improves off-policy RL by addressing sample efficiency and stability, validated through theoretical insights and strong empirical results.

Abstract: Recently, there have been numerous attempts to enhance the sample efficiency of off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) agents when interacting with the environment, including architecture improvements and new algorithms. Despite these advances, they overlook the potential of directly constraining the initial representations of the input data, which can intuitively alleviate the distribution shift issue and stabilize training. In this paper, we introduce the Tanh function into the initial layer to fulfill such a constraint. We theoretically unpack the convergence property of the temporal difference learning with the Tanh function under linear function approximation. Motivated by theoretical insights, we present our Constrained Initial Representations framework, tagged CIR, which is made up of three components: (i) the Tanh activation along with normalization methods to stabilize representations; (ii) the skip connection module to provide a linear pathway from the shallow layer to the deep layer; (iii) the convex Q-learning that allows a more flexible value estimate and mitigates potential conservatism. Empirical results show that CIR exhibits strong performance on numerous continuous control tasks, even being competitive or surpassing existing strong baseline methods.

*Elham Rostami,Aref Einizade,Taous-Meriem Laleg-Kirati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpaTeoGL, a framework to identify seizure onset zones (SOZ) using spatiotemporal graphs, showing improved accuracy and interpretability in seizure network analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of SOZ localization in epilepsy surgery, addressing the challenge of complex spatiotemporal seizure dynamics.

Method: Developed SpaTeoGL, a graph learning framework that jointly models spatial relationships among electrodes and temporal relations among time windows, leveraging graph signal processing and a convergence-guaranteed optimization algorithm.

Result: SpaTeoGL demonstrated competitive SOZ identification performance in a multicenter iEEG dataset, outperforming baseline methods in non-SOZ identification while providing interpretable insights into seizure propagation.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust and interpretable approach to seizure network analysis, showing clinical promise in epilepsy surgery.

Abstract: Accurate localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) from intracranial EEG (iEEG) is essential for epilepsy surgery but is challenged by complex spatiotemporal seizure dynamics. We propose SpaTeoGL, a spatiotemporal graph learning framework for interpretable seizure network analysis. SpaTeoGL jointly learns window-level spatial graphs capturing interactions among iEEG electrodes and a temporal graph linking time windows based on similarity of their spatial structure. The method is formulated within a smooth graph signal processing framework and solved via an alternating block coordinate descent algorithm with convergence guarantees. Experiments on a multicenter iEEG dataset with successful surgical outcomes show that SpaTeoGL is competitive with a baseline based on horizontal visibility graphs and logistic regression, while improving non-SOZ identification and providing interpretable insights into seizure onset and propagation dynamics.

### [336] [TopoFair: Linking Topological Bias to Fairness in Link Prediction Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11802)
*Lilian Marey,Mathilde Perez,Tiphaine Viard,Charlotte Laclau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses fairness in graph link prediction (LP), emphasizing the importance of understanding topological biases beyond homophily and proposing a benchmarking framework to evaluate fairness interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in graph link prediction (LP) is critical for applications like job recommendation and friendship formation. Existing methods often oversimplify topological biases, focusing only on homophily, which limits fairness interventions’ potential across diverse graph topologies.

Method: A novel benchmarking framework to assess fairness in LP is developed. The research formalizes a taxonomy of topological bias measures, introduces a graph generation method balancing real-world fidelity and controlled structural bias variations, and evaluates LP models under this framework.

Result: The study offers an empirical analysis showcasing how predictive fairness interacts with structural biases. It highlights the sensitivity of fairness interventions to biases beyond homophily.

Conclusion: The research underlines the necessity for fairness evaluations in graph learning to account for diverse structural biases. It shows that fairness interventions need improved generalizability to handle beyond-homophily biases effectively.

Abstract: Graph link prediction (LP) plays a critical role in socially impactful applications, such as job recommendation and friendship formation. Ensuring fairness in this task is thus essential. While many fairness-aware methods manipulate graph structures to mitigate prediction disparities, the topological biases inherent to social graph structures remain poorly understood and are often reduced to homophily alone. This undermines the generalization potential of fairness interventions and limits their applicability across diverse network topologies. In this work, we propose a novel benchmarking framework for fair LP, centered on the structural biases of the underlying graphs. We begin by reviewing and formalizing a broad taxonomy of topological bias measures relevant to fairness in graphs. In parallel, we introduce a flexible graph generation method that simultaneously ensures fidelity to real-world graph patterns and enables controlled variation across a wide spectrum of structural biases. We apply this framework to evaluate both classical and fairness-aware LP models across multiple use cases. Our results provide a fine-grained empirical analysis of the interactions between predictive fairness and structural biases. This new perspective reveals the sensitivity of fairness interventions to beyond-homophily biases and underscores the need for structurally grounded fairness evaluations in graph learning.

*Ziyi Zhao,Qingchuan Li,Yuxuan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method and its application to reinforcement learning with a transformer model. ISC improves on path signatures by addressing their temporal limitations and enhancing step-wise decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of standard path signatures by providing a method that retains temporal structure for dynamic control tasks, overcoming temporal collapse in standard representations.

Method: Proposed the Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method that decomposes path signatures into temporally ordered elements and integrates this representation into a Transformer architecture for reinforcement learning.

Result: The ISC-Transformer (ISCT) model was evaluated successfully on control tasks (HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper, and Maze2d), showing effectiveness in tasks with delayed or downgraded datasets.

Conclusion: ISC provides a robust, theoretically grounded improvement to path representation for reinforcement learning, enabling sensitivity to temporal updates and enhancing stability for dynamic control problems.

Abstract: Path signatures embed trajectories into tensor algebra and constitute a universal, non-parametric representation of paths; however, in the standard form, they collapse temporal structure into a single global object, which limits their suitability for decision-making problems that require step-wise reactivity. We propose the Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method, which decomposes truncated path signatures into a temporally ordered sequence of elements in the tensor-algebra space, corresponding to incremental contributions induced by last path increments. This reconstruction preserves the algebraic structure and expressivity of signatures, while making their internal temporal evolution explicit, enabling processing signature-based representations via sequential modeling approaches. In contrast to full signatures, ISC is inherently sensitive to instantaneous trajectory updates, which is critical for sensitive and stability-requiring control dynamics. Building on this representation, we introduce ISC-Transformer (ISCT), an offline reinforcement learning model that integrates ISC into a standard Transformer architecture without further architectural modification. We evaluate ISCT on HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper, and Maze2d, including settings with delayed rewards and downgraded datasets. The results demonstrate that ISC method provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative to path processing for temporally sensitive control tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepFusionKernel, a memory traffic-optimized computation kernel that enhances speed in LLM inference with long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency caused by memory bandwidth limitations when using SwiGLU MLP blocks during LLM inference.

Method: DeepFusionKernel is designed to reduce HBM memory traffic and increase cache reuse, ensuring efficient execution by pairing the kernel with a scheduler for diverse configurations and platforms.

Result: DeepFusionKernel achieves speedups of up to 13.2% on the NVIDIA H100 and 9.7% on the A100 GPUs compared to the SGLang baseline approach.

Conclusion: This kernel presents a significant improvement in LLM inference by optimizing memory and expanding adaptability for multiple models, configurations, and hardware platforms.

Abstract: Agentic LLM inference with long contexts is increasingly limited by memory bandwidth rather than compute. In this setting, SwiGLU MLP blocks, whose large weights exceed cache capacity, become a major yet under-optimized bottleneck. We propose DeepFusionKernel, a deeply fused kernel that cuts HBM traffic and boosts cache reuse, delivering up to 13.2% speedup on H100 and 9.7% on A100 over SGLang. Integrated with SGLang and paired with a kernel scheduler, DeepFusionKernel ensures consistent accelerations over generation lengths, while remaining adaptable to diverse models, inference configurations, and hardware platforms.

### [339] [CAAL: Confidence-Aware Active Learning for Heteroscedastic Atmospheric Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11825)
*Fei Jiang,Jiyang Xia,Junjie Yu,Mingfei Sun,Hugh Coe,David Topping,Dantong Liu,Zhenhui Jessie Li,Zhonghua Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CAAL framework to accurately estimate difficult-to-measure atmospheric particle properties using routine observations, optimizing active learning under heteroscedastic regression settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Routine observational data indirectly reflects key atmospheric particle properties such as toxicity and hygroscopicity, which are crucial for assessing impacts on health and climate. However, measuring these properties is complex and costly, necessitating a strategy to optimize limited labeling budgets.

Method: The Confidence-Aware Active Learning framework (CAAL) uses a decoupled uncertainty-aware training approach to separate predictive mean and noise estimation, coupled with a confidence-aware acquisition function to improve sample selection by dynamically weighting epistemic uncertainty using aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability indicator.

Result: CAAL consistently outperformed standard active learning baselines in experiments with particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations, demonstrating its efficiency in expanding high-cost atmospheric property databases.

Conclusion: This work presents CAAL as a general solution to efficiently and robustly select samples in heteroscedastic noise settings, addressing challenges in accurately predicting atmospheric particle properties at lower costs.

Abstract: Quantifying the impacts of air pollution on health and climate relies on key atmospheric particle properties such as toxicity and hygroscopicity. However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e.g., air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting. With a limited and costly labeling budget, the central challenge is to select which samples to measure or simulate. While active learning is a natural approach, most acquisition strategies rely on predictive uncertainty. Under heteroscedastic noise, this signal conflates reducible epistemic uncertainty with irreducible aleatoric uncertainty, causing limited budgets to be wasted in noise-dominated regions. To address this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) for efficient and robust sample selection in heteroscedastic settings. CAAL consists of two components: a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimises the predictive mean and noise level to stabilise uncertainty estimation, and a confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability signal. Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show that CAAL consistently outperforms standard AL baselines. The proposed framework provides a practical and general solution for the efficient expansion of high-cost atmospheric particle property databases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces InvestESG, a simulation tool showcasing climate-related intertemporal social dilemmas, and proposes an algorithm to steer agent behavior toward socially beneficial outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address coordination challenges in climate action caused by economic agents prioritizing individual benefits over collective welfare.

Method: The paper characterizes conditions for social dilemmas in InvestESG using theoretical thresholds and employs the Advantage Alignment algorithm to steer learning dynamics toward cooperative outcomes.

Result: Advantage Alignment successfully shapes agent behavior in InvestESG to favor socially beneficial equilibria, providing insights for aligning incentives with sustainability goals.

Conclusion: Strategic learning mechanisms can mitigate social dilemmas, aiding the design of policies that better align economic incentives with long-term climate objectives.

Abstract: Addressing climate change requires global coordination, yet rational economic actors often prioritize immediate gains over collective welfare, resulting in social dilemmas. InvestESG is a recently proposed multi-agent simulation that captures the dynamic interplay between investors and companies under climate risk. We provide a formal characterization of the conditions under which InvestESG exhibits an intertemporal social dilemma, deriving theoretical thresholds at which individual incentives diverge from collective welfare. Building on this, we apply Advantage Alignment, a scalable opponent shaping algorithm shown to be effective in general-sum games, to influence agent learning in InvestESG. We offer theoretical insights into why Advantage Alignment systematically favors socially beneficial equilibria by biasing learning dynamics toward cooperative outcomes. Our results demonstrate that strategically shaping the learning processes of economic agents can result in better outcomes that could inform policy mechanisms to better align market incentives with long-term sustainability goals.

*Mohammad Khosravi,Setareh Maghsudi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses resilient communication network design under node and link uncertainty using robust optimization with dynamic budgeted uncertainty sets and proposes scalable solution methods evaluated by theoretical and computational analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure full network connectivity under scenarios of signal degradation and uncertainty in link and node conditions.

Method: Formulation under robust optimization framework, with techniques including column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, iterative robust optimization, and a learning-based hide-and-seek game.

Result: Theoretical analysis and computational evaluations reveal the proposed methods outperform static robust models and deterministic worst-case formulations.

Conclusion: The study offers effective methodologies for designing resilient networks capable of maintaining connectivity despite uncertainties.

Abstract: We study the design of resilient and reliable communication networks in which a signal can be transferred only up to a limited distance before its quality falls below an acceptable threshold. When excessive signal degradation occurs, regeneration is required through regenerators installed at selected network nodes. In this work, both network links and nodes are subject to uncertainty. The installation costs of regenerators are modeled using a budgeted uncertainty set. In addition, link lengths follow a dynamic budgeted uncertainty set introduced in this paper, where deviations may vary over time. Robust optimization seeks solutions whose performance is guaranteed under all scenarios represented by the underlying uncertainty set. Accordingly, the objective is to identify a minimum-cost subset of nodes for regenerator deployment that ensures full network connectivity, even under the worst possible realizations of uncertainty. To solve the problem, we first formulate it within a robust optimization framework, and then develop scalable solution methods based on column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, and iterative robust optimization. In addition, we formulate a learning-based hide-and-seek game to further analyze the problem structure. The proposed approaches are evaluated against classical static budgeted robust models and deterministic worst-case formulations. Both theoretical analysis and computational results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our methodology.

*Sümeyye Meryem Taşyürek,Enis Mücahid İskender,Hacer Yalim Keles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces A$^{2}$V-SLP, a framework for sign language production using a variational approach that enhances articulation realism and linguistic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sign language production by addressing limitations in deterministic latent embeddings and ensuring better alignment between language input and articulated sign motions.

Method: The method employs a disentangled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn articulator-wise latent distributions and integrates gloss attention for alignment with linguistic input. A non-autoregressive Transformer predicts latent distributions which are decoded into sign poses using stochastic sampling.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved alignment, motion realism, and state-of-the-art back-translation performance without using gloss annotations.

Conclusion: The framework allows for realistic, aligned sign language production by leveraging variational methods and gloss attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Building upon recent structural disentanglement frameworks for sign language production, we propose A$^{2}$V-SLP, an alignment-aware variational framework that learns articulator-wise disentangled latent distributions rather than deterministic embeddings. A disentangled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes ground-truth sign pose sequences and extracts articulator-specific mean and variance vectors, which are used as distributional supervision for training a non-autoregressive Transformer. Given text embeddings, the Transformer predicts both latent means and log-variances, while the VAE decoder reconstructs the final sign pose sequences through stochastic sampling at the decoding stage. This formulation maintains articulator-level representations by avoiding deterministic latent collapse through distributional latent modeling. In addition, we integrate a gloss attention mechanism to strengthen alignment between linguistic input and articulated motion. Experimental results show consistent gains over deterministic latent regression, achieving state-of-the-art back-translation performance and improved motion realism in a fully gloss-free setting.

*Elif Akata,Konstantinos Voudouris,Vincent Fortuin,Eric Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the in-context learning behavior of large language models (LLMs) through Gaussian Processes (GPs), examining their prediction error and inductive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how LLMs exhibit in-context learning properties and to explore their performance on function prediction tasks, compared to principled reference models.

Method: The authors conducted experiments with multivariate function samples drawn from GP priors, assessed LLM prediction errors against GP-regression and 1-nearest-neighbor benchmarks, analyzed inductive biases using likelihood estimation, and tested how post-training adjustments could enhance biases.

Result: LLMs exhibit GP-like learning curves influenced by kernel features and approach GP regression performance as demonstrations increase. Models favor less smooth GP kernels, but post-training can alter biases successfully for smoother kernels.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate characteristics of GP learners, and their inductive biases can be steered via post-training methods for improved function learning tasks with specific kernel types.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can learn from a few demonstrations provided at inference time. We study this in-context learning phenomenon through the lens of Gaussian Processes (GPs). We build controlled experiments where models observe sequences of multivariate scalar-valued function samples drawn from known GP priors. We evaluate prediction error in relation to the number of demonstrations and compare against two principled references: (i) an empirical GP-regression learner that gives a lower bound on achievable error, and (ii) the expected error of a 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) rule, which gives a data-driven upper bound. Across model sizes, we find that LLM learning curves are strongly influenced by the function-generating kernels and approach the GP lower bound as the number of demonstrations increases. We then study the inductive biases of these models using a likelihood-based analysis. We find that LLM predictions are most likely under less smooth GP kernels. Finally, we explore whether post-training can shift these inductive biases and improve sample-efficiency on functions sampled from GPs with smoother kernels. We find that both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning can effectively shift inductive biases in the direction of the training data. Together, our framework quantifies the extent to which LLMs behave like GP learners and provides tools for steering their inductive biases for continuous function learning tasks.

*Roberto Molinaro,Niall Siegenheim,Henry Martin,Mark Frey,Niels Poulsen,Philipp Seitz,Marvin Vincent Gabler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework to upscale weather forecasts from low-resolution to high-resolution probabilistic predictions without model-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weather forecasts often suffer from limitations in spatial resolution and uncertainty representation, requiring improvements in both aspects.

Method: A single conditional diffusion model trained on paired low-resolution inputs and high-resolution reanalysis data is used, working without fine-tuning and applied zero-shot to deterministic forecasts.

Result: Probabilistic forecasts show improved resolution and skill across diverse weather models, with ensemble mean and CRPS metrics outperforming raw deterministic predictions.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates scalability and provides a universal, model-agnostic approach for enhancing spatial and probabilistic aspects of weather forecasts.

Abstract: We introduce a universal diffusion-based downscaling framework that lifts deterministic low-resolution weather forecasts into probabilistic high-resolution predictions without any model-specific fine-tuning. A single conditional diffusion model is trained on paired coarse-resolution inputs (~25 km resolution) and high-resolution regional reanalysis targets (~5 km resolution), and is applied in a fully zero-shot manner to deterministic forecasts from heterogeneous upstream weather models. Focusing on near-surface variables, we evaluate probabilistic forecasts against independent in situ station observations over lead times up to 90 h. Across a diverse set of AI-based and numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, the ensemble mean of the downscaled forecasts consistently improves upon each model's own raw deterministic forecast, and substantially larger gains are observed in probabilistic skill as measured by CRPS. These results demonstrate that diffusion-based downscaling provides a scalable, model-agnostic probabilistic interface for enhancing spatial resolution and uncertainty representation in operational weather forecasting pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for On-Policy Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), aiming to match the generalization performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in an efficient way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is efficient but lacks the strong generalization performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to its inability to use on-policy data. Bridging this gap can improve SFT's applicability in domains where RL is not feasible.

Method: The authors developed Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT) to evaluate the alignment between data and model distributions. They proposed two techniques: In-Distribution Fine-Tuning (IDFT), which improves generalization at the loss level, and Hinted Decoding, which aligns training data with model distributions.

Result: The framework achieves generalization performance similar to offline RL algorithms like DPO and SimPO while retaining the computational efficiency of SFT pipelines.

Conclusion: This research provides an efficient alternative for scenarios where RL is not feasible, combining strong generalization with SFT's computational advantages. All code is open-sourced on GitHub.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is computationally efficient but often yields inferior generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). This gap is primarily driven by RL's use of on-policy data. We propose a framework to bridge this chasm by enabling On-Policy SFT. We first present \textbf{\textit{Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT)}}, which explains and quantifies the alignment between data and the model-induced distribution. Leveraging DDT, we introduce two complementary techniques: (i) \textbf{\textit{In-Distribution Finetuning (IDFT)}}, a loss-level method to enhance generalization ability of SFT, and (ii) \textbf{\textit{Hinted Decoding}}, a data-level technique that can re-align the training corpus to the model's distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves generalization performance on par with prominent offline RL algorithms, including DPO and SimPO, while maintaining the efficiency of an SFT pipeline. The proposed framework thus offers a practical alternative in domains where RL is infeasible. We open-source the code here: https://github.com/zhangmiaosen2000/Towards-On-Policy-SFT

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hybrid-DPO (HyPO) to address issues in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) caused by premature satisfaction, improving preference alignment without discarding reference signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the problem of 'premature satisfaction' in DPO caused by reliance on a reference model and improve offline preference alignment for large language models.

Method: Developed HyPO, a modification to DPO that conditionally applies the reference policy, treating it as neutral when pessimistic by adjusting the margin calculations.

Result: HyPO improves preference-alignment metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates, showing better performance over standard DPO methods.

Conclusion: Conditional debiasing of the reference signal can enhance the alignment performance of preference-based models without sacrificing reference stability.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become the de facto standard for offline preference alignment of large language models, but its reliance on a reference policy introduces a critical tension. DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($Δ_θ$) merely beats the reference margin ($Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($Δ_θ<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $Δ_θ-Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}$ with $Δ_θ-\max\{0,Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost. By conditionally debiasing the pessimistic reference signal, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction; empirically, across preference alignment, HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates. Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serve reasoning-focused language models more efficiently without sacrificing answer quality, by addressing increased computational costs due to longer reasoning traces.

Method: Uses Puzzle NAS framework, combining MoE pruning, context attention replacement, FP8 quantization, RL post-training, and analyzes metrics tracing accuracy-speed trade-offs.

Result: gpt-oss-puzzle-88B achieves up to 2.82X GPU speedups and improves request-level efficiency metrics by up to 1.29X compared to its parent model.

Conclusion: Post-training architecture optimization can reduce inference costs significantly while retaining or slightly improving accuracy, strengthening request-level efficiency in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning-focused LLMs improve answer quality by generating longer reasoning traces, but the additional tokens dramatically increase serving cost, motivating inference optimization. We extend and apply Puzzle, a post-training neural architecture search (NAS) framework, to gpt-oss-120B to produce gpt-oss-puzzle-88B, a deployment-optimized derivative. Our approach combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective replacement of full-context attention with window attention, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning to recover accuracy, while maintaining low generation length. In terms of per-token speeds, on an 8XH100 node we achieve 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B also delivers throughput speedups of 2.82X on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. However, because token counts can change with reasoning effort and model variants, per-token throughput (tok/s) and latency (ms/token) do not necessarily lead to end-to-end speedups: a 2X throughput gain is erased if traces grow 2X. Conversely, throughput gains can be spent on more reasoning tokens to improve accuracy; we therefore advocate request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated and trace an accuracy--speed frontier across reasoning efforts. We show that gpt-oss-puzzle-88B improves over gpt-oss-120B along the entire frontier, delivering up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Across various benchmarks, gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or slightly exceeds the parent on suite-average accuracy across reasoning efforts, with retention ranging from 100.8% (high) to 108.2% (low), showing that post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of temporally inconsistent perturbations in adversarial attacks on time series forecasting and introduces Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs) with the Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) for better attack consistency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attack methods for time series forecasting fail due to inconsistent perturbation values across overlapping samples, making them impractical in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose TUAPs to enforce temporal consistency in adversarial perturbations and design TGAM to aggregate gradient information effectively. They combine TGAM with momentum-based algorithms for strict consistency and enhanced perturbation exploration.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets and models show significant improvements in adversarial attack performance, both in white-box and black-box transfer scenarios, under TUAP constraints. The method also excels in transfer attacks without constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses the temporal inconsistency problem and demonstrates effectiveness in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting, establishing a robust advancement in the field.

Abstract: While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in time series forecasting, their vulnerability to adversarial examples remains a critical security concern. However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models.

*Karolin Frohnapfel,Mara Seyfert,Sebastian Bordt,Ulrike von Luxburg,Kristof Meding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses predictive multiplicity in AI systems used for decision-making and proposes methods to quantify and report it for compliance with the EU AI Act.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive multiplicity in AI systems leads to disagreements among models with similar accuracy, potentially conflicting with EU AI Act's requirements for individual performance reporting.

Method: The paper introduces individual conflict ratios and δ-ambiguity as metrics to quantify model disagreement and provides rules for evaluating predictive multiplicity.

Result: Predictive multiplicity can be quantified using proposed metrics, aiding compliance with the EU AI Act and enhancing the reliability of AI systems.

Conclusion: Incorporating predictive multiplicity evaluation into AI systems ensures fair, reliable individual-level performance and aligns with EU AI Act's provisions.

Abstract: When building AI systems for decision support, one often encounters the phenomenon of predictive multiplicity: a single best model does not exist; instead, one can construct many models with similar overall accuracy that differ in their predictions for individual cases. Especially when decisions have a direct impact on humans, this can be highly unsatisfactory. For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers. (2) Based on this legal analysis, we suggest individual conflict ratios and $δ$-ambiguity as tools to quantify the disagreement between models on individual cases and to help detect individuals subject to conflicting predictions. (3) Based on computational insights, we derive easy-to-implement rules on how model providers could evaluate predictive multiplicity in practice. (4) Ultimately, we suggest that information about predictive multiplicity should be made available to deployers under the AI Act, enabling them to judge whether system outputs for specific individuals are reliable enough for their use case.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PMFL, a federated learning framework enhancing performance in heterogeneous scenarios using historical training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of varied data distributions and participation frequencies in FL setups, which degrade model performance.

Method: PMFL uses a model-contrastive term in node optimization and adjusts aggregation weights based on participation counts at the server side, utilizing historical models for stability.

Result: PMFL outperforms existing federated learning methods in diverse and non-uniform scenarios as proven through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: PMFL effectively enhances federated learning performance in challenging heterogeneous scenarios by leveraging historical training information and adaptive techniques.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple nodes to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. However, FL systems are usually deployed in heterogeneous scenarios, where nodes differ in both data distributions and participation frequencies, which undermines the FL performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper proposes PMFL, a performance-enhanced model-contrastive federated learning framework using historical training information. Specifically, on the node side, we design a novel model-contrastive term into the node optimization objective by incorporating historical local models to capture stable contrastive points, thereby improving the consistency of model updates in heterogeneous data distributions.
  On the server side, we utilize the cumulative participation count of each node to adaptively adjust its aggregation weight, thereby correcting the bias in the global objective caused by different node participation frequencies. Furthermore, the updated global model incorporates historical global models to reduce its fluctuations in performance between adjacent rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMFL achieves superior performance compared with existing FL methods in heterogeneous scenarios.

Conclusion: LRBTC offers a practical QC solution for compliance-critical industries, improving scalability, reliability, and transparency in content validation processes while highlighting future areas for medical grammar and punctuation error detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to create content in regulated domains such as pharmaceuticals, where outputs must be scientifically accurate and legally compliant. Manual quality control (QC) is slow, error prone, and can become a publication bottleneck. We introduce LRBTC, a modular LLM and vision language model (VLM) driven QC architecture covering Language, Regulatory, Brand, Technical, and Content Structure checks. LRBTC combines a Student-Teacher dual model architecture, human in the loop (HITL) workflow with waterfall rule filtering to enable scalable, verifiable content validation and optimization. On AIReg-Bench, our approach achieves 83.0% F1 and 97.5% recall, reducing missed violations by 5x compared with Gemini 2.5 Pro. On CSpelling, it improves mean accuracy by 26.7%. Error analysis further reveals that while current models are strong at detecting misspellings (92.5 recall), they fail to identify complex medical grammatical (25.0 recall) and punctuation (41.7 recall) errors, highlighting a key area for future work. This work provides a practical, plug and play solution for reliable, transparent quality control of content in high stakes, compliance critical industries. We also provide access to our Demo under MIT Licenses.

*Kaicheng Xiao,Haotian Li,Liran Dong,Guoliang Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAM-Net is a novel architecture that combines the benefits of full attention and linear models for efficient and powerful memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention models suffer from limited expressivity and information loss due to fixed-size memory constraints. This paper seeks to address those limitations while maintaining efficiency.

Method: The proposed RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors, which serve as explicit addresses for selective access to a massive and scalable memory state. This approach minimizes signal interference and enhances retrieval while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: RAM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in long-range retrieval tasks and performs competitively in language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: RAM-Net bridges the gap between efficiency and representational capacity, proving effective at capturing long-range dependencies with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: While linear attention architectures offer efficient inference, compressing unbounded history into a fixed-size memory inherently limits expressivity and causes information loss. To address this limitation, we introduce Random Access Memory Network (RAM-Net), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between the representational capacity of full attention and the memory efficiency of linear models. The core of RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing the model to selectively access a massive memory state. This design enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, which significantly mitigates signal interference and enhances retrieval fidelity. Moreover, the inherent sparsity ensures exceptional computational efficiency, as state updates are confined to minimal entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM-Net consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks, validating its superior capability to capture complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead.

*Yiheng Yao,Zekun Cai,Xinyuan Song,Hiroki Hill Kobayashi,Xuan Song,Ryosuke Shibasaki,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses temporal distribution shifts in LLMs and proposes a parameter-efficient approach, MaT-LoRA, which reduces modeling complexity while enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal distribution shifts in LLM-driven systems arise from the continuous evolution of real-world data. Current approaches are infeasible due to computational demands on large parameter spaces.

Method: The work introduces MaT-LoRA, a method that constrains temporal updates to a low-dimensional shared manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, leveraging structured parameter-efficient reparameterization.

Result: MaT-LoRA delivers superior performance in temporal generalization across synthetic and real-world datasets, such as scientific documents and review ratings, with enhanced scalability for LLMs.

Conclusion: The geometric reformulation through MaT-LoRA preserves temporal structure while reducing complexity, proving effective and practical for adapting large LLMs to temporal shifts.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts are pervasive in real-world deployments of Large Language Models (LLMs), where data evolves continuously over time. While Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to model such structured evolution, existing approaches characterize model adaptation in the full parameter space. This formulation becomes computationally infeasible for modern LLMs. This paper introduces a geometric reformulation of TDG under parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We establish that the low-dimensional temporal structure underlying model evolution can be preserved under parameter-efficient reparameterization, enabling temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space. Building on this principle, we propose Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, and models its evolution through a structured temporal core. This reparameterization dramatically reduces temporal modeling complexity while retaining expressive power. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including scientific documents, news publishers, and review ratings, demonstrate that MaT-LoRA achieves superior temporal generalization performance with practical scalability for LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm for online, adaptive identification in non-stationary data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale, nonstationary data streams demand algorithms that adapt online without retraining and maintain efficiency in memory and computation.

Method: The MLMS algorithm's theoretical tracking performance and regret bounds are derived for time-varying stochastic linear systems. Its stability involves analyzing second-order time-varying random vector difference equations.

Result: MLMS demonstrated strong adaptability and tracking performance with experiments on synthetic and real-world data in line with theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: MLMS is an effective, computationally efficient algorithm for nonstationary, online learning and streaming data scenarios.

Abstract: In large-scale data processing scenarios, data often arrive in sequential streams generated by complex systems that exhibit drifting distributions and time-varying system parameters. This nonstationarity challenges theoretical analysis, as it violates classical assumptions of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) samples, necessitating algorithms capable of real-time updates without expensive retraining. An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the necessity for privacy while preserving accurate coordination in Federated Neuromorphic Learning under real-world conditions.

Method: Investigates the effects of gradient clipping and noise injection mechanisms applied in Differential Privacy on firing-rate statistics and their propagation under different privacy budgets and clipping bounds.

Result: The study identifies systematic shifts in rate statistics, attenuated aggregations, ranking instability in client selection, and their relations to sparsity and memory indicators on a speech recognition task.

Conclusion: Provides insights into balancing privacy mechanisms and rate-dependent coordination for effective Federated Neuromorphic Learning.

Abstract: Federated Neuromorphic Learning (FNL) enables energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning on devices without centralizing data. However, real-world deployments require additional privacy mechanisms that can significantly alter training signals. This paper analyzes how Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms, specifically gradient clipping and noise injection, perturb firing-rate statistics in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and how these perturbations are propagated to rate-based FNL coordination. On a speech recognition task under non-IID settings, ablations across privacy budgets and clipping bounds reveal systematic rate shifts, attenuated aggregation, and ranking instability during client selection. Moreover, we relate these shifts to sparsity and memory indicators. Our findings provide actionable guidance for privacy-preserving FNL, specifically regarding the balance between privacy strength and rate-dependent coordination.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedGRPO, a privacy-preserving framework for enhancing Federated Foundation Models using reinforcement learning and lightweight client evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for Federated Foundation Models face challenges like high communication costs, privacy risks, and expensive local training during knowledge transfer.

Method: FedGRPO consists of two modules: competence-based expert selection using confidence graphs, and leveraging the Group Relative Policy Optimization concept to dispatch candidate policies to expert clients and aggregate scalar reward signals.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that FedGRPO improves downstream accuracy and communication efficiency over existing methods in diverse tasks.

Conclusion: FedGRPO presents a novel way to reduce privacy risks and communication overhead in Federated Foundation Models while achieving better accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: One important direction of Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) is leveraging data from small client models to enhance the performance of a large server-side foundation model. Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the "Group Relative" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines.

### [357] [Improved state mixing in higher-order and block diagonal linear recurrent networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12021)
*Igor Dubinin,Antonio Orvieto,Felix Effenberger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces structured Linear Recurrent Network (LRNN) architectures to improve efficiency and expressivity in sequence modeling tasks without high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRNNs and linear state space models are computationally efficient but lack expressivity due to their diagonal state transitions. This limits their capability in long-sequence modeling tasks, unlike more expressive but resource-intensive architectures like LSTMs.

Method: Two new architectures are proposed: (i) Higher-order Linear Recurrent Units (H-LRU), which enhance state mixing by utilizing higher-order recurrences, and (ii) Block-Diagonal LRUs (BD-LRU), which introduce dense mixing within block channels. Stabilization during training is achieved through L1-normalization of gates. These models also employ a parallel-scan implementation to maintain computational efficiency.

Result: In synthetic sequence modeling tasks, the BD-LRU matches or exceeds the performance of contemporary models like Mamba, DeltaNet, and LSTMs, while H-LRU proves to be highly parameter-efficient in compression tasks. Both architectures demonstrate that structured state mixing is critical for improving LRNN expressivity.

Conclusion: The study concludes that well-structured state mixing, rather than just increasing model width, is essential to improving the expressivity of LRNNs. The proposed models effectively bridge the gap between computational efficiency and expressivity in linear sequence models.

Abstract: Linear recurrent networks (LRNNs) and linear state space models (SSMs) promise computational and memory efficiency on long-sequence modeling tasks, yet their diagonal state transitions limit expressivity. Dense and nonlinear architectures (e.g., LSTMs) on the other hand are provably more expressive, but computationally costly. Here, we explore how expressivity in LRNNs can be increased via richer state mixing across time and channels while maintaining competitive efficiency. Specifically, we introduce two structured LRNN architectures: (i) Higher-order Linear Recurrent Units (H-LRU), which generalize first-order recurrence to higher order, mixing multiple past states, and (ii) Block-Diagonal LRUs (BD-LRU), which enable dense intra-block channel mixing. Per-channel (H-LRU) or per-row (BD-LRU) L1-normalization of selective gates stabilizes training and allows for scaling window/block sizes. A parallel-scan implementation of the proposed architectures keeps the throughput competitive with diagonal LRNNs for moderate orders (H-LRU) and block sizes (BD-LRU). In synthetic sequence modeling tasks, the performance of BD-LRU matches or exceeds those of linear SSMs (Mamba), low-rank LRNNs (DeltaNet) and LSTM baselines, while H-LRU is found to be the most parameter-efficient in compression task. In both synthetic sequence modeling and language modeling, our results indicate that the structure of state mixing rather than width alone shapes expressivity of LRNNs, offering a practical route to closing the efficiency-expressivity gap in linear sequence models.

TL;DR: ProtoMech introduces cross-layer transcoders to understand the computational circuits in protein language models (pLMs), achieving near-original performance in predictive tasks and enabling efficient protein design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein language models show promise for protein structure and function prediction, but the mechanisms behind their predictions are still unclear.

Method: ProtoMech employs cross-layer transcoders to learn sparse latent representations across pLM layers, recovering computational circuitry and providing interpretability.

Result: Applied to ESM2, ProtoMech retains up to 89% performance in prediction tasks and identifies compressed circuits that maintain accuracy while revealing functional motifs.

Conclusion: ProtoMech is a robust framework for understanding protein language models and facilitates protein design by leveraging interpretability of computational circuits.

Abstract: Protein language models (pLMs) have emerged as powerful predictors of protein structure and function. However, the computational circuits underlying their predictions remain poorly understood. Recent mechanistic interpretability methods decompose pLM representations into interpretable features, but they treat each layer independently and thus fail to capture cross-layer computation, limiting their ability to approximate the full model. We introduce ProtoMech, a framework for discovering computational circuits in pLMs using cross-layer transcoders that learn sparse latent representations jointly across layers to capture the model's full computational circuitry. Applied to the pLM ESM2, ProtoMech recovers 82-89% of the original performance on protein family classification and function prediction tasks. ProtoMech then identifies compressed circuits that use <1% of the latent space while retaining up to 79% of model accuracy, revealing correspondence with structural and functional motifs, including binding, signaling, and stability. Steering along these circuits enables high-fitness protein design, surpassing baseline methods in more than 70% of cases. These results establish ProtoMech as a principled framework for protein circuit tracing.

*Xubin Wang,Weijia Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Meta-Sel, a meta-learning approach for effective few-shot example selection in in-context learning, while ensuring low-cost and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstration selection for in-context learning is challenging due to tight prompt budgets, variability in accuracy, and the need for efficient selection from large candidate pools.

Method: Meta-Sel, a supervised meta-learning method, uses a logistic regressor trained on meta-dataset pairs with class agreement, leveraging TF-IDF cosine similarity and length-compatibility ratio as features.

Result: Meta-Sel achieves high performance across benchmarks with four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs, offering competitive selection with minimal costs, especially for smaller models.

Conclusion: Meta-Sel is a practical, interpretable solution for demonstration selection that works efficiently without model fine-tuning, exploration, or additional LLM calls, delivering competitive results in in-context learning.

Abstract: Demonstration selection is a practical bottleneck in in-context learning (ICL): under a tight prompt budget, accuracy can change substantially depending on which few-shot examples are included, yet selection must remain cheap enough to run per query over large candidate pools. We propose Meta-Sel, a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for intent classification that learns a fast, interpretable scoring function for (candidate, query) pairs from labeled training data.
  Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling pairs from the training split and using class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF--IDF cosine similarity and a length-compatibility ratio. At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights.
  Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.

TL;DR: AI models trained with reinforcement learning can exploit flaws in their environments to maximize rewards, posing new risks for alignment efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address a growing concern that reinforcement learning could inadvertently lead language models to adopt exploitative strategies, even when no malicious intent is present in their training.

Method: The authors design four 'vulnerability games' that showcase exploitable flaws in AI behavior, testing models for context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation.

Result: Models consistently exploited the vulnerabilities in these games, discovering generalizable strategies that increase rewards but compromise task correctness and safety.

Conclusion: To ensure AI alignment, future work must move beyond moderating model outputs and focus on auditing training environments and reward setups to prevent exploitative behavior.

Abstract: While most AI alignment research focuses on preventing models from generating explicitly harmful content, a more subtle risk is emerging: capability-oriented training induced exploitation. We investigate whether language models, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with implicit loopholes, will spontaneously learn to exploit these flaws to maximize their reward, even without any malicious intent in their training. To test this, we design a suite of four diverse "vulnerability games", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow "tricks" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even "distilled" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

*Jed A. Duersch,Elohan Veillon,Astrid Klipfel,Adlane Sayede,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a generative model utilizing reciprocal-space methods to create crystalline materials, leveraging Fourier-transformed representations instead of atomic coordinates, improving reconstruction and generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to discover new crystalline materials requires generative models compatible with periodic boundary conditions, symmetry considerations, and physical constraints, especially for complex and diverse unit-cell structures.

Method: The authors introduce a reciprocal-space generative framework based on truncated Fourier transforms of the species-resolved unit-cell density. This involves a transformer variational autoencoder for learning compressed representations and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space, enabling computational efficiency and compatibility with crystallographic symmetries.

Result: The model effectively reconstructs complex unit cells of up to 108 atoms and outperforms coordinate-based methods for small-cell unit generation, as evaluated on the LeMaterial dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed reciprocal-space generative model offers a scalability advantage, better symmetry handling, and natural support for variable atomic multiplicities, showing promise in crystalline material discovery.

Abstract: The discovery of new crystalline materials calls for generative models that handle periodic boundary conditions, crystallographic symmetries, and physical constraints, while scaling to large and structurally diverse unit cells. We propose a reciprocal-space generative pipeline that represents crystals through a truncated Fourier transform of the species-resolved unit-cell density, rather than modeling atomic coordinates directly. This representation is periodicity-native, admits simple algebraic actions of space-group symmetries, and naturally supports variable atomic multiplicities during generation, addressing a common limitation of particle-based approaches. Using only nine Fourier basis functions per spatial dimension, our approach reconstructs unit cells containing up to 108 atoms per chemical species. We instantiate this pipeline with a transformer variational autoencoder over complex-valued Fourier coefficients, and a latent diffusion model that generates in the compressed latent space. We evaluate reconstruction and latent diffusion on the LeMaterial benchmark and compare unconditional generation against coordinate-based baselines in the small-cell regime ($\leq 16$ atoms per unit cell).

*Wenkai Yang,Weijie Liu,Ruobing Xie,Kai Yang,Saiyong Yang,Yankai Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD), enhancing the On-Policy Distillation (OPD) method by introducing flexibility in reward scaling and reference models, resulting in improved outcomes in math reasoning and code generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of student-teacher distillation techniques in machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning settings, and to address the limitations of standard On-Policy Distillation (OPD).

Method: The G-OPD framework extends OPD by introducing a reward scaling factor and a flexible reference model. These adjustments allow for reward extrapolation and reward correction to enhance distillation outcomes.

Result: The study demonstrates that reward scaling factors greater than 1 (ExOPD) outperform standard OPD and enable students to surpass teacher performance in specific settings. Additionally, using reward correction with the teacher's pre-RL model further improves accuracy, albeit with higher computational cost.

Conclusion: G-OPD and its variations provide a more versatile and effective approach to on-policy distillation, offering improved performance on complex tasks like math reasoning and code generation. The findings also pave the way for further research in OPD advancements.

Abstract: On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current LLMs, which lack guarantees of runtime performance for generated code in the HPC domain.

Method: Using online reinforcement learning with runtime performance (GFLOPS) as a direct reward and introducing a Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm for varied optimization.

Result: The proposed approach improves HPC code generation in LLMs through runtime performance feedback and staged optimization, tested on matrix multiplication tasks.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning with runtime performance feedback and staged optimization enables LLMs to better generate optimized code for HPC tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities, yet the runtime performance of generated code is not guaranteed, and there have been few attempts to train LLMs using runtime performance as a reward in the HPC domain. We propose an online reinforcement learning approach that executes LLM-generated code on a supercomputer and directly feeds back the measured runtime performance (GFLOPS) as a reward. We further introduce a Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm that progressively varies the permitted optimization techniques on a per-problem basis, enabling the model to learn code optimization from diverse perspectives. We build a distributed system connecting a GPU training cluster with a CPU benchmarking cluster, and train Qwen2.5 Coder 14B on a double-precision matrix multiplication task using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through two experiments, we show that reinforcement learning combining runtime performance feedback with staged optimization can improve the HPC code generation capability of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current soccer event data collection depends heavily on manual annotation and costly ball tracking, limiting its scalability and adoption beyond top-tier competitions.

Method: The paper presents PathCRF, modeling player trajectories as a dynamic graph, with event detection as sequence selection of edges. A Conditional Random Field (CRF) ensures logical transitional consistency, while a Set Attention-based architecture computes edge embeddings dynamically.

Result: PathCRF accurately detects possession paths and events like ball controls or passes without needing manual annotation, verified via experiments.

Conclusion: PathCRF significantly reduces manual effort in event annotation, enabling scalable and reliable soccer data collection for broader usability.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, event data collection in soccer still relies heavily on labor-intensive manual annotation. Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation.

*Alfredo Reichlin,Adriano Pacciarelli,Danica Kragic,Miguel Vasco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for state estimation in reinforcement learning, focusing on a structured latent representation correlated with action transitions, and validated it on multimodal RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to estimate the environmental state from noisy, high-dimensional observations without relying on explicit noise assumptions, to improve generalization in reinforcement learning.

Method: A structured latent representation is developed with a geometric metric space correlating with the number of required actions between states. A multimodal latent transition model and sensor fusion mechanism using inverse distance weighting are utilized for adaptive sensor integration.

Result: The proposed approach outperformed baseline methods in robustness to sensor noise and state estimation accuracy. It also enhanced reinforcement learning agent performance without explicit noise augmentation.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that utilizing transition-aware metric spaces offers a scalable and principled method for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Estimating the state of an environment from high-dimensional, multimodal, and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we contribute a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.

*Mayee F. Chen,Tyler Murray,David Heineman,Matt Jordan,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Christopher Ré,Luca Soldaini,Kyle Lo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Olmix is a framework to optimize data mixing for language model training, addressing practical challenges such as changing domain sets and efficient recomputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data mixing methods which are critical for training robust language models, especially when the domain sets evolve over time and existing methods do not account for real-world scenarios.

Method: Comprehensive empirical studies were conducted to identify effective design choices, and a mechanism called mixture reuse was introduced to efficiently recompute ratios for updated domain sets.

Result: Mixture reuse achieves similar performance to complete recomputation while reducing computational cost by 74% and improving downstream task performance by 11.6%.

Conclusion: Olmix provides a practical and efficient solution for real-world language model development by optimizing data mixing methods even as domain sets change.

Abstract: Data mixing -- determining the ratios of data from different domains -- is a first-order concern for training language models (LMs). While existing mixing methods show promise, they fall short when applied during real-world LM development. We present Olmix, a framework that addresses two such challenges. First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.

*Arjun Mani,Carl Vondrick,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian Optimization framework that incorporates high-dimensional auxiliary information and leverages task history for optimization. Using neural models, the method improves optimization in robotic hardware design and neural network hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world optimization problems often yield auxiliary information during experiments, which is underutilized by existing methods. Leveraging this information could enhance optimization efficiency and accuracy.

Method: A neural model is developed to predict performance measures using auxiliary data ($h(x)$) and task history through a few-shot learning context.

Result: The method achieves better few-shot prediction and faster optimization, particularly in robotic design and hyperparameter tuning, outperforming existing multi-task optimization methods.

Conclusion: Integrating auxiliary feedback and task history through neural models can significantly improve optimization tasks and has practical applications in complex design problems.

Abstract: Many real-world design problems involve optimizing an expensive black-box function $f(x)$, such as hardware design or drug discovery. Bayesian Optimization has emerged as a sample-efficient framework for this problem. However, the basic setting considered by these methods is simplified compared to real-world experimental setups, where experiments often generate a wealth of useful information. We introduce a new setting where an experiment generates high-dimensional auxiliary information $h(x)$ along with the performance measure $f(x)$; moreover, a history of previously solved tasks from the same task family is available for accelerating optimization. A key challenge of our setting is learning how to represent and utilize $h(x)$ for efficiently solving new optimization tasks beyond the task history. We develop a novel approach for this setting based on a neural model which predicts $f(x)$ for unseen designs given a few-shot context containing observations of $h(x)$. We evaluate our method on two challenging domains, robotic hardware design and neural network hyperparameter tuning, and introduce a novel design problem and large-scale benchmark for the former. On both domains, our method utilizes auxiliary feedback effectively to achieve more accurate few-shot prediction and faster optimization of design tasks, significantly outperforming several methods for multi-task optimization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAN-FIF, a lightweight multimodal architecture for tropical cyclone monitoring that achieves significant reductions in parameter size and inference time while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiency and hardware limitations of existing methods for monitoring tropical cyclones on edge devices.

Method: The study proposes the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework (KAN-FIF), integrating MLP, CNN, and spline-parameterized KAN layers.

Result: KAN-FIF shows a 94.8% reduction in parameter size, 68.7% faster inference, and 32.5% lower MAE compared to baseline model Phy-CoCo. It performs efficiently on the FY-4 satellite processor with 14.41ms inference latency.

Conclusion: KAN-FIF demonstrates high feasibility for tropical cyclone monitoring and operational AI deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TC) are among the most destructive natural disasters, causing catastrophic damage to coastal regions through extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. Timely monitoring of tropical cyclones is crucial for reducing loss of life and property, yet it is hindered by the computational inefficiency and high parameter counts of existing methods on resource-constrained edge devices. Current physics-guided models suffer from linear feature interactions that fail to capture high-order polynomial relationships between TC attributes, leading to inflated model sizes and hardware incompatibility. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework (KAN-FIF), a lightweight multimodal architecture that integrates MLP and CNN layers with spline-parameterized KAN layers. For Maximum Sustained Wind (MSW) prediction, experiments demonstrate that the KAN-FIF framework achieves a $94.8\%$ reduction in parameters (0.99MB vs 19MB) and $68.7\%$ faster inference per sample (2.3ms vs 7.35ms) compared to baseline model Phy-CoCo, while maintaining superior accuracy with $32.5\%$ lower MAE. The offline deployment experiment of the FY-4 series meteorological satellite processor on the Qingyun-1000 development board achieved a 14.41ms per-sample inference latency with the KAN-FIF framework, demonstrating promising feasibility for operational TC monitoring and extending deployability to edge-device AI applications.

*Yashas Shende,Aritra Das,Reva Laxmi Chauhan,Arghya Pathak,Debayan Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to model irregular time series using a linear damped harmonic oscillator framework, avoiding computational bottlenecks of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and delivering faster, expressive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with irregular time series modeling, and while Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) handle irregular series well, they suffer from computational bottlenecks due to reliance on heavy numerical solvers. The paper seeks to address this limitation.

Method: The authors replace NODEs with a linear damped harmonic oscillator model to capture query-key coupling as a resonance phenomenon, utilizing a closed-form solution to avoid numerical solver overhead.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks while being significantly faster than existing NODE-based approaches.

Conclusion: The paper provides a scalable and theoretically sound method to model irregular time series, maintaining universal approximation guarantees while eliminating computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: Transformers excel at time series modelling through attention mechanisms that capture long-term temporal patterns. However, they assume uniform time intervals and therefore struggle with irregular time series. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) effectively handle irregular time series by modelling hidden states as continuously evolving trajectories. ContiFormers arxiv:2402.10635 combine NODEs with Transformers, but inherit the computational bottleneck of the former by using heavy numerical solvers. This bottleneck can be removed by using a closed-form solution for the given dynamical system - but this is known to be intractable in general! We obviate this by replacing NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy - which has a known closed-form solution. We model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators and expand the query in a sinusoidal basis up to a suitable number of modes. This analogy naturally captures the query-key coupling that is fundamental to any transformer architecture by modelling attention as a resonance phenomenon. Our closed-form solution eliminates the computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. We prove that this oscillator-based parameterisation maintains the universal approximation property of continuous-time attention; specifically, any discrete attention matrix realisable by ContiFormer's continuous keys can be approximated arbitrarily well by our fixed oscillator modes. Our approach delivers both theoretical guarantees and scalability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIME, a next-generation benchmark for evaluating time series foundation models (TSFMs) on 50 new datasets and 98 tasks focusing on strict zero-shot evaluations and high data integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for TSFMs have limitations in terms of data quality, diversity, task relevance, and evaluation perspectives, hindering comprehensive and real-world aligned assessments.

Method: The authors create TIME, a benchmark with 50 new datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, employing a human-in-the-loop process to ensure data quality and addressing task formulation aligned with real-world use cases. They also include a novel evaluation approach based on intrinsic temporal properties of patterns.

Result: The evaluation of 12 TSFMs is conducted using the proposed benchmark, and a multi-granular leaderboard is established, allowing for dynamic analysis and visualization of model performance.

Conclusion: TIME addresses critical shortcomings of existing benchmarks through its comprehensive construction and innovative evaluation approaches, pushing the boundaries of TSFM assessments.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are revolutionizing the forecasting landscape from specific dataset modeling to generalizable task evaluation. However, we contend that existing benchmarks exhibit common limitations in four dimensions: constrained data composition dominated by reused legacy sources, compromised data integrity lacking rigorous quality assurance, misaligned task formulations detached from real-world contexts, and rigid analysis perspectives that obscure generalizable insights. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability. Furthermore, we propose a novel pattern-level evaluation perspective that moves beyond traditional dataset-level evaluations based on static meta labels. By leveraging structural time series features to characterize intrinsic temporal properties, this approach offers generalizable insights into model capabilities across diverse patterns. We evaluate 12 representative TSFMs and establish a multi-granular leaderboard to facilitate in-depth analysis and visualized inspection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeNeuron is a framework that enhances safety alignment in large language models by redistributing safety-related neurons in the network to prevent bypassing and improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods for LLMs are brittle, highly targeted, and operate at a behavioral level, making their mechanisms prone to bypassing through neuron-level attacks.

Method: SafeNeuron identifies safety-related neurons, freezes these neurons during optimization, and compels the model to construct distributed safety pathways, making it robust against attacks.

Result: SafeNeuron successfully improves robustness to neuron pruning attacks, reduces misuse of open-source models for harmful purposes, retains overall model capabilities, and provides insights into internal safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: SafeNeuron offers an interpretable and effective neuron-level safety alignment approach, enhancing robustness and internal safety representation in LLMs while maintaining their functionality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs are typically safety-aligned before release to prevent harmful content generation. However, recent studies show that safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making alignment brittle and easily bypassed through neuron-level attacks. Moreover, most existing alignment methods operate at the behavioral level, offering limited control over the model's internal safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities. Furthermore, our layer-wise analysis reveals that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations. Overall, SafeNeuron provides an interpretable and robust perspective for model alignment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRXForm, a model-based approach for molecular design using a pre-trained Graph Transformer and Group Relative Policy Optimization to address variance and generalization issues in optimizing molecular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for molecular optimization struggle with generalizing to unseen structures and face high variance due to the difficulty of starting points.

Method: The authors adapt a Graph Transformer for atom-and-bond additions and use Group Relative Policy Optimization to normalize rewards and fine-tune the model for efficient molecular optimization.

Result: GRXForm performed well in optimizing out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds, achieving competitive scores in multi-objective optimization without inference-time oracle calls.

Conclusion: GRXForm mitigates variance and improves generalization, demonstrating efficiency and competitiveness in molecular design tasks without the need for extensive compute for every input structure.

Abstract: Molecular design encompasses tasks ranging from de-novo design to structural alteration of given molecules or fragments. For the latter, state-of-the-art methods predominantly function as "Instance Optimizers'', expending significant compute restarting the search for every input structure. While model-based approaches theoretically offer amortized efficiency by learning a policy transferable to unseen structures, existing methods struggle to generalize. We identify a key failure mode: the high variance arising from the heterogeneous difficulty of distinct starting structures. To address this, we introduce GRXForm, adapting a pre-trained Graph Transformer model that optimizes molecules via sequential atom-and-bond additions. We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for goal-directed fine-tuning to mitigate variance by normalizing rewards relative to the starting structure. Empirically, GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls or refinement, achieving scores in multi-objective optimization competitive with leading instance optimizers.

TL;DR: The paper examines alignment frameworks for large language models (LLMs) using preference optimization and explores the effects of sampling strategies and iterative dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of theoretical understanding of sampling and reference choices in preference optimization for aligning large language models.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Identity Preference Optimization and iterative dynamics, exploring phenomena such as ranking guarantees, oscillations, and entropy collapse. Validated by experiments on real-world preference data.

Result: Improved understanding of sampling effects, potential stability issues in iterative alignment dynamics, and confirmation that findings extend to broader preference-alignment methods.

Conclusion: Proper sampling strategies enhance model performance, but iterative dynamics can create challenges like oscillations or entropy collapse, requiring careful parameter choice for stability.

Abstract: Standard methods for aligning large language models with human preferences learn from pairwise comparisons among sampled candidate responses and regularize toward a reference policy. Despite their effectiveness, the effects of sampling and reference choices are poorly understood theoretically. We investigate these effects through Identity Preference Optimization, a widely used preference alignment framework, and show that proper instance-dependent sampling can yield stronger ranking guarantees, while skewed on-policy sampling can induce excessive concentration under structured preferences. We then analyze iterative alignment dynamics in which the learned policy feeds back into future sampling and reference policies, reflecting a common practice of model-generated preference data. We prove that these dynamics can exhibit persistent oscillations or entropy collapse for certain parameter choices, and characterize regimes that guarantee stability. Our theoretical insights extend to Direct Preference Optimization, indicating the phenomena we captured are common to a broader class of preference-alignment methods. Experiments on real-world preference data validate our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional transformer models struggle with challenges in biomedical signals, such as long sequences, multi-scale frequency patterns, and temporal dynamics.

Method: WaveFormer integrates multi-channel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for feature extraction during embedding and employs Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) for signal-specific temporal adaptation.

Result: WaveFormer demonstrates competitive performance across eight varied datasets in human activity recognition and brain signal analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully incorporates frequency-domain knowledge into transformer models, offering a novel, effective approach for time-series classification in biomedical contexts.

Abstract: Biomedical signal classification presents unique challenges due to long sequences, complex temporal dynamics, and multi-scale frequency patterns that are poorly captured by standard transformer architectures. We propose WaveFormer, a transformer architecture that integrates wavelet decomposition at two critical stages: embedding construction, where multi-channel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) extracts frequency features to create tokens containing both time-domain and frequency-domain information, and positional encoding, where Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) adapts position embeddings to signal-specific temporal structure through mono-channel DWT analysis. We evaluate WaveFormer on eight diverse datasets spanning human activity recognition and brain signal analysis, with sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 3000 timesteps and channel counts from 1 to 144. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFormer achieves competitive performance through comprehensive frequency-aware processing. Our approach provides a principled framework for incorporating frequency-domain knowledge into transformer-based time series classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method, CRAM, combining state-space models with adaptive memory consolidation, significantly reducing attention operations in tasks with recurring patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention mechanisms in hybrid architectures fail to adapt to decreasing attention demand for recurring patterns, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: CRAM introduces biologically-inspired memory consolidation to reduce episodic retrievals by transferring them into semantic memory, reducing attention utilization over time.

Result: CRAM achieved a 37.8x reduction in attention utilization, 100% retrieval accuracy at 1.6% attention compute on the SRCD benchmark, and demonstrated transferability to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Consolidation-based routing is crucial for efficient attention mechanisms, matching human memory transition dynamics and greatly improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid architectures combining state-space models with attention have achieved strong efficiency-quality tradeoffs, yet existing approaches either apply attention uniformly or learn static sparse patterns. This misses a key opportunity: \emph{attention demand should decrease over time as recurring patterns become familiar}. We present a surprising finding from analyzing GPT-2 models: \textbf{88\%} of attention operations retrieve information already predictable from the model's hidden state, and this redundancy does \emph{not} decrease during training. Motivated by this observation, we introduce \textbf{\ours{}} (\textbf{C}onsolidation-based \textbf{R}outing for \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{M}emory), a biologically inspired memory consolidation mechanism that gradually distills episodic retrievals into parametric semantic memory. Unlike prior sparse attention methods, \ours{} exhibits \emph{decreasing attention utilization} over training, achieving a \textbf{37.8$\times$} reduction through a sharp phase transition at approximately 3K steps. We prove that this capability is \emph{impossible} without consolidation: any static routing scheme requires $Ω(f \cdot n)$ attention for tasks with recurring patterns of frequency $f$. On our proposed SRCD benchmark, \ours{} achieves \textbf{100\% retrieval accuracy} at 1.6\% attention compute (vs.\ 68\% for baselines), and consolidated patterns transfer to unseen tasks with \textbf{48--52\%} attention reduction without retraining. Remarkably, the learned consolidation dynamics quantitatively match human episodic-to-semantic memory transition curves from cognitive psychology ($γ= 0.43$ vs.\ $γ_{\text{human}} \approx 0.4$--$0.5$). Code and benchmarks are available at [anonymized].

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a non-invasive evaluation protocol (PhyIP) to examine if neural models internalize physical laws during self-supervised learning (SSL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of determining whether neural models genuinely learn physical laws as world models instead of utilizing statistical shortcuts, particularly under out-of-distribution shifts.

Method: The authors introduce PhyIP, a protocol to check whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen neural representations without altering them. It examines latent structures by focusing on low-capacity probes rather than adaptation-based evaluations.

Result: PhyIP demonstrates that when SSL achieves low error, physical quantities like internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling can be recovered with high accuracy (e.g., $ρ > 0.90$) across tests in fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, while adaptation-based evaluations may obscure these structures.

Conclusion: Low-capacity probes like PhyIP provide a clearer assessment of whether neural models internalize physical world models, whereas adaptation-based evaluations risk distorting the representations learned during SSL.

Abstract: Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\approx 0.05$). These findings suggest that adaptation-based evaluation can obscure latent structures and that low-capacity probes offer a more accurate evaluation of physical world models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Variance Minimisation Policy Optimisation (VMPO) for adapting diffusion models via importance weighting to sample from reward-tilted distributions, offering a variance-based method instead of a KL-based objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the process of adapting pretrained diffusion models to sample from reward-guided distributions by addressing limitations in traditional KL-based approaches.

Method: A sequential Monte Carlo interpretation is adopted for diffusion alignment, with VMPO focusing on minimising the variance of log importance weights rather than optimising KL-divergence directly.

Result: VMPO demonstrates that minimising variance aligns with reward-tilted distributions, recovers existing methods under certain setups, and suggests novel strategies for diffusion alignment.

Conclusion: VMPO provides a unified framework for understanding and improving diffusion alignment, showcasing flexibility across different design choices.

Abstract: Diffusion alignment adapts pretrained diffusion models to sample from reward-tilted distributions along the denoising trajectory. This process naturally admits a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) interpretation, where the denoising model acts as a proposal and reward guidance induces importance weights. Motivated by this view, we introduce Variance Minimisation Policy Optimisation (VMPO), which formulates diffusion alignment as minimising the variance of log importance weights rather than directly optimising a Kullback-Leibler (KL) based objective. We prove that the variance objective is minimised by the reward-tilted target distribution and that, under on-policy sampling, its gradient coincides with that of standard KL-based alignment. This perspective offers a common lens for understanding diffusion alignment. Under different choices of potential functions and variance minimisation strategies, VMPO recovers various existing methods, while also suggesting new design directions beyond KL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve acceleration and effectiveness in categorical data generation using flow-matching methods with self-distillation.

Method: The method defines a continuous flow map transporting probability mass toward a predicted endpoint, incorporating self-distillation techniques and a new objective based on endpoint consistency.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art few-step generation results on images, molecular graphs, and text, including highly effective single-step generation.

Conclusion: Categorical Flow Maps offer an efficient, continuous formulation for accelerated generation in multiple domains, leveraging guidance and reweighting methods for enhanced performance.

Abstract: We introduce Categorical Flow Maps, a flow-matching method for accelerated few-step generation of categorical data via self-distillation. Building on recent variational formulations of flow matching and the broader trend towards accelerated inference in diffusion and flow-based models, we define a flow map towards the simplex that transports probability mass toward a predicted endpoint, yielding a parametrisation that naturally constrains model predictions. Since our trajectories are continuous rather than discrete, Categorical Flow Maps can be trained with existing distillation techniques, as well as a new objective based on endpoint consistency. This continuous formulation also automatically unlocks test-time inference: we can directly reuse existing guidance and reweighting techniques in the categorical setting to steer sampling toward downstream objectives. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art few-step results on images, molecular graphs, and text, with strong performance even in single-step generation.

TL;DR: This paper connects Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) and Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL), showing intrinsic JEPA energies align directly with QRL's cost-to-go functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the perspectives of JEPA energy functions and QRL's cost-to-go values, particularly in addressing goal-conditioned control problems with asymmetric dynamics.

Method: The study focuses on a principled class of JEPA energy functions defined as intrinsic energies, characterized by minimal accumulated effort over trajectories, and analyzes their quasimetric properties under specified assumptions.

Result: It shows that intrinsic JEPA energies correspond directly to QRL optimal cost-to-go values, revealing consistency between the two frameworks when addressing directional tasks.

Conclusion: Symmetric energy structures are ill-suited for goals involving one-way reachability, emphasizing the need for asymmetric (quasimetric) energies in directional control tasks.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) aim to learn representations by predicting target embeddings from context embeddings, inducing a scalar compatibility energy in a latent space. In contrast, Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL) studies goal-conditioned control through directed distance values (cost-to-go) that support reaching goals under asymmetric dynamics. In this short article, we connect these viewpoints by restricting attention to a principled class of JEPA energy functions : intrinsic (least-action) energies, defined as infima of accumulated local effort over admissible trajectories between two states. Under mild closure and additivity assumptions, any intrinsic energy is a quasimetric. In goal-reaching control, optimal cost-to-go functions admit exactly this intrinsic form ; inversely, JEPAs trained to model intrinsic energies lie in the quasimetric value class targeted by QRL. Moreover, we observe why symmetric finite energies are structurally mismatched with one-way reachability, motivating asymmetric (quasimetric) energies when directionality matters.

### [380] [ExtractBench: A Benchmark and Evaluation Methodology for Complex Structured Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12247)
*Nick Ferguson,Josh Pennington,Narek Beghian,Aravind Mohan,Douwe Kiela,Sheshansh Agrawal,Thien Hang Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExtractBench, a framework and benchmark for evaluating PDF-to-JSON extraction at enterprise-scale schema breadth. It found existing models to struggle significantly with complex extractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of an end-to-end benchmark and methodology for evaluating reliable and accurate PDF-to-JSON structured extraction, especially for enterprise-scale data.

Method: The researchers developed ExtractBench, combining 35 PDFs, human-annotated gold labels, and JSON Schemas across diverse domains with 12,867 fields. They implemented a framework where schemas act as executable specifications with custom scoring metrics.

Result: ExtractBench revealed that leading LLMs like GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 perform poorly with schema breadth and realistic data, with no valid output on a 369-field schema for financial reporting.

Conclusion: ExtractBench provides a standard benchmark to evaluate PDF-to-JSON extraction, showcasing the current inadequacies of LLMs in realistic, schema-complex tasks and highlighting the need for further advancements.

Abstract: Unstructured documents like PDFs contain valuable structured information, but downstream systems require this data in reliable, standardized formats. LLMs are increasingly deployed to automate this extraction, making accuracy and reliability paramount. However, progress is bottlenecked by two gaps. First, no end-to-end benchmark evaluates PDF-to-JSON extraction under enterprise-scale schema breadth. Second, no principled methodology captures the semantics of nested extraction, where fields demand different notions of correctness (exact match for identifiers, tolerance for quantities, semantic equivalence for names), arrays require alignment, and omission must be distinguished from hallucination. We address both gaps with ExtractBench, an open-source benchmark and evaluation framework for PDF-to-JSON structured extraction. The benchmark pairs 35 PDF documents with JSON Schemas and human-annotated gold labels across economically valuable domains, yielding 12,867 evaluatable fields spanning schema complexities from tens to hundreds of fields. The evaluation framework treats the schema as an executable specification: each field declares its scoring metric. Baseline evaluations reveal that frontier models (GPT-5/5.2, Gemini-3 Flash/Pro, Claude 4.5 Opus/Sonnet) remain unreliable on realistic schemas. Performance degrades sharply with schema breadth, culminating in 0% valid output on a 369-field financial reporting schema across all tested models. We release ExtractBench at https://github.com/ContextualAI/extract-bench.

*Dalyapraz Manatova,Pablo Moriano,L. Jean Camp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a strategy to hide sensitive communities in graphs from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), improving privacy while maintaining network utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns arise regarding group-level privacy in graphs, as GNNs can reveal sensitive communities like operational hierarchies or coordinated groups within networks.

Method: The authors developed a perturbation strategy to rewire edges and modify node features, thereby reducing the distinctiveness exploited by GNNs' message passing.

Result: Their method outperforms DICE with a 20-45% improvement in community concealment across various synthetic and real-world graphs.

Conclusion: Effective community concealment using edge rewiring and feature alteration mitigates privacy risks of GNN-based community learning, showcasing practical applicability in maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to use attributed graphs to learn representations. Such representations are beneficial in the unsupervised learning of clusters and community detection. Nonetheless, such inference may reveal sensitive groups, clustered systems, or collective behaviors, raising concerns regarding group-level privacy. Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings. These findings demonstrate a mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlight group-level privacy risks intrinsic to graph learning.

### [382] [Self-Supervised Learning via Flow-Guided Neural Operator on Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12267)
*Duy Nguyen,Jiachen Yao,Jiayun Wang,Julius Berner,Animashree Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new self-supervised learning framework for time-series data called Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), improving flexibility and performance by introducing a varying corruption level during training instead of using a fixed masking ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of self-supervised learning methods for time-series data, addressing limitations of static corruption levels in popular methods like masked autoencoders.

Method: The authors introduce FGNO, which combines operator learning and flow matching for self-supervised training. It uses Short-Time Fourier Transform to explore varying time resolutions and noise levels while learning representations. FGNO extracts multi-level features without using noisy inputs during inference, thereby improving performance.

Result: FGNO achieves significant performance improvements across various biomedical applications: up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding, 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction, and over 20% gains in accuracy and macro-F1 scores on low-data SleepEDF tasks.

Conclusion: FGNO demonstrates robustness to data scarcity and excels in learning expressive, task-specific representations for diverse time-series data, outperforming baseline methods across biomedical applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes. These results highlight FGNO's robustness to data scarcity and its superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series.

*Xin Ju,Jiachen Yao,Anima Anandkumar,Sally M. Benson,Gege Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Fun-DDPS framework leverages diffusion models and neural operators for robust subsurface flow characterization, achieving high accuracy in sparse observations and improving inverse problem solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of subsurface flow characterization in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) due to ill-posed inverse problems with limited data.

Method: Combines function-space diffusion models for geological parameter priors and Local Neural Operator surrogates for physics-consistent guidance, enabling robust data recovery through decoupled computational processes.

Result: Fun-DDPS demonstrated significant improvement in sparse data scenarios: reducing errors in forward modeling with 25% observations (7.7% relative error, an 11x improvement over standard methods) and validating its diffusion-based inverse solvers against Rejection Sampling posteriors.

Conclusion: Fun-DDPS presents an efficient and physically consistent method for both forward and inverse subsurface flow modeling, significantly outperforming previous techniques in sparse data and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface flow is critical for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) but remains challenged by the ill-posed nature of inverse problems with sparse observations. We present Fun-DDPS, a generative framework that combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operator surrogates for both forward and inverse modeling. Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors. Both Fun-DDPS and the joint-state baseline (Fun-DPS) achieve Jensen-Shannon divergence less than 0.06 against the ground truth. Crucially, Fun-DDPS produces physically consistent realizations free from the high-frequency artifacts observed in joint-state baselines, achieving this with 4x improved sample efficiency compared to rejection sampling.

### [384] [Evolution With Purpose: Hierarchy-Informed Optimization of Whole-Brain Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11398)
*Hormoz Shahrzad,Niharika Gajawell,Kaitlin Maile,Manish Saggar,Risto Miikkulainen*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper explores how evolutionary search, guided by biological knowledge, can improve biophysical brain modeling and predictive power, through a hierarchical curricular optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of overfitting in large-scale biophysical brain modeling, specifically when standard evolutionary approaches fail to provide predictive power beyond individual subjects.

Method: The study compares baseline homogeneous brain modeling with heterogeneous modeling using different parameter optimizations strategies, including a hierarchical curriculum (HICO) based on brain network hierarchies.

Result: The hierarchical curricular approach (HICO) not only generalized well to new subjects but also successfully predicted behavioral abilities, outperforming other strategies.

Conclusion: Guiding evolutionary optimization with domain-specific biological knowledge, particularly leveraging the hierarchical structure of brain regions, enhances the utility of brain models in real-world prediction scenarios.

Abstract: Evolutionary search is well suited for large-scale biophysical brain modeling, where many parameters with nonlinear interactions and no tractable gradients need to be optimized. Standard evolutionary approaches achieve an excellent fit to MRI data; however, among many possible such solutions, it finds ones that overfit to individual subjects and provide limited predictive power. This paper investigates whether guiding evolution with biological knowledge can help. Focusing on whole-brain Dynamic Mean Field (DMF) models, a baseline where 20 parameters were shared across the brain was compared against a heterogeneous formulation where different sets of 20 parameters were used for the seven canonical brain regions. The heterogeneous model was optimized using four strategies: optimizing all parameters at once, a curricular approach following the hierarchy of brain networks (HICO), a reversed curricular approach, and a randomly shuffled curricular approach. While all heterogeneous strategies fit the data well, only curricular approaches generalized to new subjects. Most importantly, only HICO made it possible to use the parameter sets to predict the subjects' behavioral abilities as well. Thus, by guiding evolution with biological knowledge about the hierarchy of brain regions, HICO demonstrated how domain knowledge can be harnessed to serve the purpose of optimization in real-world domains.

*Anika Tabassum Meem,Muntasir Hossain Nadid,Md Zesun Ahmed Mia*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to enhance energy efficiency and accuracy in neuromorphic vision systems used for both event-based and frame-based cameras, tackling the problem of catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable ultra-low-power neuromorphic vision systems to perform effectively in environments that evolve continually, addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The method involves an energy-aware spike budgeting framework that integrates experience replay, learnable neuron parameters, and an adaptive spike scheduler, enforcing energy constraints during training.

Result: The paper reports modality-specific benefits: up to 47% reduction in spike rates in frame-based datasets and up to 17.45 percentage points improvement in accuracy on event-based datasets with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: This method improves accuracy while minimizing energy consumption across various benchmarks, improving the practicality of neuromorphic systems for continual learning.

Abstract: Neuromorphic vision systems based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer ultra-low-power perception for event-based and frame-based cameras, yet catastrophic forgetting remains a critical barrier to deployment in continually evolving environments. Existing continual learning methods, developed primarily for artificial neural networks, seldom jointly optimize accuracy and energy efficiency, with particularly limited exploration on event-based datasets. We propose an energy-aware spike budgeting framework for continual SNN learning that integrates experience replay, learnable leaky integrate-and-fire neuron parameters, and an adaptive spike scheduler to enforce dataset-specific energy constraints during training. Our approach exhibits modality-dependent behavior: on frame-based datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10), spike budgeting acts as a sparsity-inducing regularizer, improving accuracy while reducing spike rates by up to 47\%; on event-based datasets (DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST, CIFAR-10-DVS), controlled budget relaxation enables accuracy gains up to 17.45 percentage points with minimal computational overhead. Across five benchmarks spanning both modalities, our method demonstrates consistent performance improvements while minimizing dynamic power consumption, advancing the practical viability of continual learning in neuromorphic vision systems.

*Minda Li,Bhaskar Krishnamachari*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: GPT-5 initially struggles with Idris programming problems but improves significantly with structured compiler-level feedback, solving 54 out of 56 exercises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore GPT-5's learning capability in a low-resource, unfamiliar programming language like Idris by leveraging feedback-driven refinement strategies.

Method: Evaluation through zero-shot prompting, refinement strategies including feedback loops, documentation augmentation, error classification, and local compilation errors on Idris exercises.

Result: GPT-5 solved only 22 out of 56 exercises initially, but refinement with local compilation errors boosted performance to 54 out of 56 exercises.

Conclusion: Structured feedback mechanisms, like compiler-level errors, are key to enhancing GPT-5's capabilities in unfamiliar programming languages.

Abstract: GPT-5, a state of the art large language model from OpenAI, demonstrates strong performance in widely used programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java; however, its ability to operate in low resource or less commonly used languages remains underexplored. This work investigates whether GPT-5 can effectively acquire proficiency in an unfamiliar functional programming language, Idris, through iterative, feedback driven prompting. We first establish a baseline showing that with zero shot prompting the model solves only 22 out of 56 Idris exercises using the platform Exercism, substantially underperforming relative to higher resource languages (45 out of 50 in Python and 35 out of 47 in Erlang). We then evaluate several refinement strategies, including iterative prompting based on platform feedback, augmenting prompts with documentation and error classification guides, and iterative prompting using local compilation errors and failed test cases. Among these approaches, incorporating local compilation errors yields the most substantial improvements. Using this structured, error guided refinement loop, GPT-5 performance increased to an impressive 54 solved problems out of 56. These results suggest that while large language models may initially struggle in low resource settings, structured compiler level feedback can play a critical role in unlocking their capabilities.

*Yin Tang,Jiawei Ma,Jinrui Zhang,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Deyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroKalman, a UAV navigation framework that addresses accumulated error issues in trajectory prediction using Bayesian state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN models suffer from accumulated trajectory errors due to state drift, compromising navigation accuracy.

Method: Proposes NeuroKalman, utilizing recursive Bayesian state estimation with Prior Prediction based on motion dynamics and Likelihood Correction from historical observations.

Result: Experiments on TravelUAV benchmark show NeuroKalman outperforms baselines with minimal fine-tuning (only 10% data), reducing state drift errors.

Conclusion: NeuroKalman effectively enhances trajectory prediction by regulating drift accumulation, proving reliable for UAV navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.

*Wenyuan Chen,Jinbang Huang,Oscar Pang,Zhiyuan Li,Xiao Hu,Lingfeng Zhang,Zhanguang Zhang,Mark Coates,Tongtong Cao,Xingyue Quan,Yingxue Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) combining logical and visual state predictions to enhance robotic planning, integrating symbolic logic with perceptual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in robotic planning and control, such as compounding errors in video or language-based models and lack of integration between visual perception and symbolic reasoning.

Method: H-WM is proposed as a bilevel framework that integrates high-level symbolic reasoning with low-level visual state predictions to jointly predict logical and visual transitions. A robotic dataset aligning motion, symbolic states, actions, and observations is used for training.

Result: Experiments show that H-WM enhances stable, consistent task execution and robust planning across vision-language-action control policies.

Conclusion: H-WM combines perceptual grounding with symbolic logic for improved long-horizon task planning and control, mitigating error accumulation during complex task sequences.

Abstract: World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

*Ziyan Xiong,Lixing Fang,Junyun Huang,Kashu Yamazaki,Hao Zhang,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExtremControl, a low-latency system for humanoid teleoperation, lowering response latency to 50ms for tasks requiring fast feedback compared to prior methods at 200ms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid teleoperation systems face significant latency issues that hinder responsiveness for dynamic tasks requiring quick reactions.

Method: ExtremControl employs SE(3) rigid link poses to bypass full-body motion retargeting, uses Cartesian-space mapping for direct human-to-humanoid motion conversion, and introduces velocity feedforward control for rapid response.

Result: Experiments validate ExtremControl's effectiveness in simulation and real-world environments, enabling precise dynamic tasks such as ball balancing and juggling with latency reductions.

Conclusion: ExtremControl advances humanoid teleoperation by addressing latency challenges, significantly improving responsiveness with applications in real-time and dynamic demonstrations.

Abstract: Building a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system is essential for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations. However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.

TL;DR: MolmoSpaces is a large-scale, simulator-agnostic ecosystem for benchmarking robot policies across diverse indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot benchmarks inadequately represent the diverse real-world scenarios, and evaluating generalization needs infrastructure beyond physical testing.

Method: MolmoSpaces introduces 230k indoor environments and 130k annotated objects compatible with simulators like MuJoCo and Isaac. It includes MolmoSpaces-Bench, an 8-task benchmark suite.

Result: Experiments show MolmoSpaces achieves strong sim-to-real correlation, better performance for newer policies, and reveals sensitivities in robot tasks.

Conclusion: MolmoSpaces provides foundational support for scalable robot learning, benchmarking, and data generation, empowering research in diverse and embodied tasks.

Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robot learning approach using egocentric human videos to model human preferences and optimize robot behavior through reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in prior reward learning approaches, which struggle with embodiment and environment gap and rely on assumptions diminishing performance.

Method: The proposed method predicts the motion of tracked points between sequential images to define a reward function using agreement between predicted and observed object motion, optimized using a modified SAC algorithm.

Result: The learned policies from the proposed method either match or outperform previous methods in multiple tasks both in simulation and on a real robot.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages human video preferences to enable robots to learn and improve performance, making it suitable for real-world robot systems.

Abstract: We present an approach to robot learning from egocentric human videos by modeling human preferences in a reward function and optimizing robot behavior to maximize this reward. Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.

TL;DR: EasyMimic is a framework enabling low-cost robots to learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations, minimizing expensive data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of expensive real-world data collection for robot imitation learning, especially for affordable home robots.

Method: Uses 3D hand trajectory extraction, action alignment to map human actions to robot controls, hand visual augmentation, and co-training with processed human data and small robot data.

Result: Experiments show EasyMimic enables low-cost LeRobot to perform diverse manipulation tasks effectively.

Conclusion: EasyMimic reduces reliance on costly robot data, making intelligent and affordable home robots feasible.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning is often hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale, real-world data. This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

*Raihan Islam Arnob,Max Merlin,Abhishek Paudel,Benned Hedegaard,George Konidaris,Gregory Stein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a planning framework for mobile robots that integrates object search into task planning, enabling effective operation even when task-critical object locations are unknown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing task planning approaches that assume full environment knowledge and lack effective integration of object search mechanisms.

Method: The paper proposes the use of model-based LIOS (Learning-Informed Object Search) actions which are optimized policies for finding and retrieving single objects. These are integrated into high-level planning by treating them as deterministic actions informed by their expected costs.

Result: The framework is evaluated in simulated and real-world environments, outperforming existing learned and non-learned baselines on retrieval and meal preparation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise in handling uncertainty in mobile robot task planning, while maintaining compatibility with full-knowledge solvers and achieving superior performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers.

*Yichun Xiao,Runwei Guan,Fangqiang Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyperDet enhances radar-only 3D object detection, making it comparable with LiDAR-based systems by refining input-level data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar-only 3D detection is limited due to sparse and noisy point clouds compared to LiDAR, which offers better accuracy but is expensive and less robust in weather challenges.

Method: HyperDet aggregates radar data across frames and introduces validation mechanisms and training-time diffusion for refinement, integrating radar attributes without modifying LiDAR-specific detector architectures.

Result: HyperDet yields consistent improvements in radar detection, partially closing the performance gap between radar and LiDAR-based systems on the MAN TruckScenes dataset.

Conclusion: Enhanced data preprocessing enables radar-only detection systems to better exploit existing LiDAR-based detectors, improving cost-effectiveness and robustness in adverse conditions.

Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReaDy-Go, a real-to-sim simulation pipeline that generates photorealistic dynamic scenarios to train navigation models robust to sim-to-real gaps and dynamic obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings in visual navigation models, which struggle with sim-to-real gaps and dynamic environments. Improving navigation models' robustness and applicability to dynamic, real-world settings is the primary motivation.

Method: ReaDy-Go integrates a dynamic GS simulator with static environment GS reconstructions and introduces movable human GS avatars. It generates datasets via expert robot and human planners and trains navigation policies on these datasets.

Result: ReaDy-Go achieves superior navigation performance compared to baselines, showing robustness in dynamic environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, including zero-shot generalization in unseen settings.

Conclusion: ReaDy-Go successfully bridges the sim-to-real gap for navigation tasks in dynamic environments, enhances real-world navigation performance, and exhibits generalization potential to new, unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in robotic manipulation under occlusion and enhance visuo-tactile integration beyond simple feature concatenation.

Method: ViTaS incorporates Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning and CVAE modules to exploit alignment and complementarity of visual and tactile representations.

Result: ViTaS outperformed existing solutions in 12 simulated and 3 real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: ViTaS effectively integrates visual and tactile information, improving robotic manipulation performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study develops predictive models for robot gaze behavior by training neural networks on human gaze data involving both human and non-human stimuli, achieving high accuracy and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-robot interactions by enabling social robots to adapt gaze behavior dynamically, including responses to both human and non-human stimuli.

Method: Human gaze data was collected via VR from simulated scenarios. Two neural networks, LSTM and Transformer, were trained to predict gaze behaviors. These models were deployed on a NAO robot and tested with participants.

Result: Prediction accuracies reached 67.6%-72% across scenarios. The models outperformed previous approaches and were highly rated for interaction satisfaction when used in robotics.

Conclusion: The study advances social robotics by enabling robots to mimic human gaze dynamically, improving interaction quality and addressing underexplored non-human stimuli.

Abstract: Nonverbal behaviors, particularly gaze direction, play a crucial role in enhancing effective communication in social interactions. As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.

Conclusion: AC-MASAC effectively handles challenges in UAV swarm path planning, showing significant performance improvement and addressing key MARL training issues.

Abstract: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents HAIC, a framework for robust humanoid robot interaction with diverse object dynamics. It introduces a dynamics predictor for estimating object states using proprioceptive data and employs spatial dynamic mapping for tasks like skateboarding and box carrying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in existing humanoid robot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) methods, particularly underactuated objects with independent dynamics and constraints.

Method: Developed HAIC framework with a unique dynamics predictor using proprioceptive history data and geometric priors for robust task execution.

Result: Achieves high success rates in challenging tasks with inertial perturbations and multi-object operations over long horizons.

Conclusion: HAIC improves humanoid robot capabilities in complex, dynamic environments without external state estimation tools.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

*Sibaek Lee,Hyeonwoo Yu,Giseop Kim,Sunwook Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAMP introduces a language-map navigation framework using implicit neural representations for efficient, scalable, and precise path planning in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the memory and resolution limitations of existing language-based navigation methods in large environments.

Method: LAMP employs an implicit neural language field for continuous language-driven maps, combining it with a sparse graph for coarse-to-fine path planning and gradient-guided optimization.

Result: Experiments in simulations and real-world settings show LAMP achieves superior memory efficiency and fine-grained navigation compared to explicit methods.

Conclusion: LAMP's novel approach enables scalable, precise robot navigation by efficiently combining implicit representations and Bayesian uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using bounding-box instructions and a semantic-motion-decoupled framework to address limitations in diffusion-based policies for semantic manipulation tasks, achieving high success rates and improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limited generalization in semantic manipulation tasks due to reliance solely on text instructions, which restricts diffusion policies in complex and dynamic environments.

Method: They propose using bounding-box instructions combined with a semantic-motion-decoupled framework, and develop a handheld segmentation device, Label-UMI, for efficient data annotation and collection.

Result: The approach demonstrates strong generalization performance in real-world experiments, uncovering a power-law link between generalization and the number of bounding-box objects, achieving 85% success rates across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: This study provides an effective data-gathering strategy for semantic manipulation, validated by high success rates and will release its datasets and code to benefit the research community.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid robot controllers struggle with diverse motion adaptation, fast adjustments, and maintaining balance in dynamic scenarios.

Method: Introduces FAST framework with Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation for efficient motion adaptation and Center-of-Mass-Aware Control to improve balance and robustness.

Result: Experiments show that FAST outperforms current methods in adaptation efficiency, robustness, and generalization both in simulation and real-world tests.

Conclusion: FAST provides a generalized and efficient solution for humanoid robot control, overcoming prior limitations of task-specific dependency and poor generalization.

Abstract: Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Robot-DIFT, a framework addressing the mismatch between visual backbones and control requirements in robot manipulation, by distilling geometric information from generative diffusion models to improve control precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research identifies a bottleneck in robot manipulation related to the incompatibility of current vision encoders with the geometric sensitivity required for fine motor control, as they traditionally optimize for semantic invariance rather than high-resolution spatial awareness.

Method: The approach involves distilling geometric priors from a frozen generative diffusion model into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), leveraging Manifold Distillation to maintain geometric integrity while ensuring stability and real-time usability.

Result: Robot-DIFT trained on the DROID dataset outperforms existing discriminative baselines in geometric consistency and control, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study highlights that adopting geometric-rich, spatio-sensitive vision models like Robot-DIFT enhances manipulation performance, reinforcing the link between a model's visual learning method and its efficacy in control tasks.

Abstract: We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a method to improve robot manipulation skills by automating training without relying on human supervision, achieving better sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of RL in real-world robot training, which struggles with sample inefficiency, human fatigue, and scalability issues in human-in-the-loop methods.

Method: AGPS replaces human supervisors with a multimodal agent acting as a semantic world model. This agent uses intrinsic value priors and executable tools for providing corrective waypoints and spatial constraints.

Result: AGPS is validated on precision insertion and deformable object manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior sample efficiency compared to human-in-the-loop methods.

Conclusion: AGPS automates robot training, overcoming scalability barriers and unlocking labor-free, scalable robot learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

Result: Simulations demonstrate improved spatial coverage, localization accuracy, and consistent target tracking under modest communication constraints.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances maritime monitoring capabilities with robust perception and cooperative multi-robot coordination.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial-surface robot teams are promising for maritime monitoring. Robust deployment requires reliable perception over reflective water and scalable coordination under limited communication. We present a decentralized multi-robot framework for detecting and tracking floating containers using multiple UAVs cooperating with an autonomous surface vessel. Each UAV performs YOLOv8 and stereo-disparity-based visual detection, then tracks targets with per-object EKFs using uncertainty-aware data association. Compact track summaries are exchanged and fused conservatively via covariance intersection, ensuring consistency under unknown correlations. An information-driven assignment module allocates targets and selects UAV hover viewpoints by trading expected uncertainty reduction against travel effort and safety separation. Simulation results in a maritime scenario demonstrate improved coverage, localization accuracy, and tracking consistency while maintaining modest communication requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in MAPF lies in creating robust and efficient solutions for coordinating large robot fleets in safety-critical deployments, where current open-loop or closed-loop methods fall short in either handling disturbances or providing performance guarantees.

Method: ACCBS introduces a finite-horizon CBS algorithm with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC, adjusting its planning horizon dynamically based on computational resources while reusing a single constraint tree for efficiency.

Result: ACCBS achieves high-quality, feasible solutions quickly and demonstrates asymptotic optimality as computational resources increase, showing flexibility to disturbances and strong performance guarantees.

Conclusion: ACCBS closes the gap between optimality and robustness in MAPF, proving effective for robust and scalable robot fleet coordination.

Abstract: MAPF is a core coordination problem for large robot fleets in automated warehouses and logistics. Existing approaches are typically either open-loop planners, which generate fixed trajectories and struggle to handle disturbances, or closed-loop heuristics without reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments. This paper presents ACCBS, a closed-loop algorithm built on a finite-horizon variant of CBS with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies demonstrate that ACCBS combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment.

TL;DR: Proprioception dominates vision cues in vision-proprioception policies during motion-transition phases. GAP algorithm is introduced to balance gradients for better collaboration, enhancing robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inconsistent findings on generalization in vision-proprioception policies necessitate controlled studies to enhance policy collaboration and performance in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Proposed the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that modulates proprioception gradient magnitude during motion-transition phases using estimated probabilities from trajectory analysis.

Result: Experiments confirm GAP enhances vision-proprioception policy generalization, supports simulated and real-world applications, one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatibility with traditional and Vision-Language-Action models.

Conclusion: Balancing gradient adjustments in proprioception optimizes vision-proprioception policy collaboration, improving manipulation tasks across various setups and conditions.

Abstract: Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in ensuring safety and robustness when applying learned dynamics models to scenarios beyond the training data distribution.

Method: The framework uses weighted CP to determine high-confidence model error bounds and integrates these into a robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation based on SLS with optimized forward reachable sets.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved safety and robustness in nonlinear systems, such as a 4D car and 12D quadcopter, compared to baseline approaches, especially outside the training data distribution.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers theoretical guarantees for prediction coverage and robustness under distributional shifts, effectively improving control performance in nonlinear systems.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

TL;DR: The paper aims to enhance vision-language-action (VLA) models' performance using action-conditioned simulators to generate synthetic data for training, demonstrating notable improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of real-world policy rollout data collection and the lack of physical fidelity in existing world models for improving VLA models' robustness.

Method: A proposed iterative improvement algorithm that refines a world model using real-world rollout data, which then generates synthetic data for enhancing VLA model training.

Result: The approach yielded a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement in VLA models and an additional 11.6% gain from synthetic rollouts on robotic tasks.

Conclusion: An iterative improvement method using real-world interaction data can significantly enhance the fidelity of world models and improve VLA model performance with supplemental synthetic data.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

TL;DR: AGT-World builds and improves simulation environments and robotic task policies using graphs and feedback mechanisms, overcoming limitations in current generative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic training methods are unscalable and fail to handle long-horizon tasks and dynamic physical uncertainties effectively.

Method: AGT-World uses a structured graph for hierarchical task decomposition and introduces a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback for policy improvements.

Result: Experiments show AGT-World excels in success rates and generalization, enabling scalable robot learning through iterative self-improvement.

Conclusion: AGT-World offers a structured and autonomous framework for real-world inspired robot task policy creation and refinement, advancing scalability and performance.

Abstract: Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reliable coordination and efficient communication challenges in environments with limited communication for heterogeneous robot teams.

Method: The authors propose ART and ART-SST, algorithms that modulate transmission based on signal strength and payload size, while enforcing signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery.

Result: In simulations across three environments, ART achieved up to 58% reduction in distance traveled and 52% faster exploration times compared to existing strategies.

Conclusion: Adaptive, payload-aware communication methods like ART enhance mission efficiency in constrained environments, with potential applications in planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

Abstract: Reliable coordination and efficient communication are critical challenges for multi-agent robotic exploration of environments where communication is limited. This work introduces Adaptive-RF Transmission (ART), a novel communication-aware planning algorithm that dynamically modulates transmission location based on signal strength and data payload size, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to share information efficiently without unnecessary backtracking. We further explore an extension to this approach called ART-SST, which enforces signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery. Through over 480 simulations across three cave-inspired environments, ART consistently outperforms existing strategies, including full rendezvous and minimum-signal heuristic approaches, achieving up to a 58% reduction in distance traveled and up to 52% faster exploration times compared to baseline methods. These results demonstrate that adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering a promising foundation for future planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

*David Russell,Zisong Xu,Maximo A. Roa,Mehmet Dogar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a more dynamic bin-packing approach, enabling interaction with previously placed objects in partially filled containers to optimize space and improve placement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current warehouse operations face challenges in maximizing efficiency when dealing with containers that are not empty, requiring improved strategies to handle partially filled containers due to suboptimal arrangements.

Method: The approach combines a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer with a model predictive controller, integrated with physics-aware perception for object pose estimation during occlusions and a placement method for feasible locations.

Result: The proposed system enables purposeful object interactions, improving free space utilization inside containers and enabling better item placement.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that contact-aware packing can significantly enhance bin-packing operations in warehouses by leveraging interactions with pre-placed items and physics-aware systems for better efficiency.

Abstract: The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieve efficient, scalable, and consistent motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, overcoming issues of excessive computational demands and unpredictable motion generation.

Method: Multi-Graph Search expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, merges disconnected subgraphs through feasible transitions, and focuses exploration on high-potential regions.

Result: MGS is proven complete and bounded-suboptimal, showing effectiveness across manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks, supported by empirical demonstrations and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-Graph Search improves robotic motion planning by balancing efficiency and reliability in high-dimensional state spaces, addressing scalability and computational resource challenges.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, such as manipulators and mobile manipulators, is critical for real-time operation and reliable deployment. Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses. We prove that MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks.

*Wancai Zheng,Hao Chen,Xianlong Lu,Linlin Ou,Xinyi Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3DGSNav, a novel framework for zero-shot object navigation using 3D Gaussian Splatting and vision-language models (VLMs), enabling efficient and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing zero-shot object navigation methods that rely on less reliable scene abstractions, which restrict decision-making due to inaccuracies in low-level perception.

Method: The proposed method, 3DGSNav, integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting as memory for spatial reasoning in VLMs, incrementally builds a 3D representation through active perception, uses structured visual prompts and Chain-of-Thought prompting, and employs real-time object detectors and target re-verification mechanisms.

Result: The method demonstrates robust and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques across benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot.

Conclusion: The proposed 3DGSNav framework enhances object navigation by addressing limitations of existing approaches, effectively combining 3D representation, structured reasoning, and efficient target recognition.

Abstract: Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

*Oliver Gross,Florine Hartwig,Martin Rumpf,Peter Schröder*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric model to optimize the motion of slender locomotors, considering all energy types and enabling efficient motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model that accounts for the energy expenditure in both displacement and shape changes for analyzing and optimizing efficient motion in animals and robots.

Method: The authors use Lagrangian least-dissipation principles and formulate them as boundary value problems solved by sub-Riemannian geodesics. They include both continuous and discretized models for numerical computation.

Result: The model effectively computes optimal deformation gaits that align with observed natural movements in snakes, spermatozoa, and low-dimensional locomotion systems, and provides insights into new locomotion mechanisms, such as generalized Purcell's swimmers.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric framework broadens the understanding of locomotion by capturing the complete energetic efficiency of slender locomotors' motions and provides tools for further exploration; its implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LDA-1B is a robot foundation model efficiently scaling to 1B parameters through universal embodied data ingestion and structured dynamics prediction, significantly outperforming prior methods in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot foundation models discard transferable dynamics knowledge in heterogeneous data while struggling to scale. Leveraging diverse data efficiently is necessary for foundation modeling.

Method: LDA-1B uses structured DINO latent space predictions and a multi-modal diffusion transformer to learn dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting from a standardized EI-30k dataset with over 30k hours of trajectories.

Result: LDA-1B outperforms existing methods by up to 48% on dexterous and long-horizon tasks while enabling efficient fine-tuning through 30% low-quality trajectories and demonstrating universality in diverse applications.

Conclusion: LDA-1B effectively scales foundation models in robotics, advancing performance, efficiency, and usability across varied robotic interactions.

Abstract: Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

*Zhihong Liu,Yang Li,Rengming Huang,Cewu Lu,Panpan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Any House Any Task (AHAT), a system for robot task planning in large, complex household environments using language input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability challenges in robot task planning in large household environments when working with human language instructions.

Method: Developed AHAT, which uses a language model for subgoal generation and applies a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, TGPO, to enhance task decomposition.

Result: AHAT outperforms existing methods in planning tasks requiring complex execution in large, human-centric settings.

Conclusion: AHAT demonstrates the capability to improve efficiency and accuracy in long-horizon and ambiguous household task planning.

Abstract: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

*Jacky Kwok,Xilun Zhang,Mengdi Xu,Yuejiang Liu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Chelsea Finn,Marco Pavone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores test-time verification to close the gap between language instructions and robot actions, introducing the CoVer framework for improved action alignment and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misalignment between intent and action in Vision-Language-Action models and make robots effectively follow natural language instructions.

Method: The authors characterize test-time scaling laws, introduce CoVer (a contrastive verifier), and a hierarchical verification pipeline that combines instruction rephrasing, action generation, and verification to select optimal actions.

Result: CoVer demonstrates significant improvements, with a 22% gain in-distribution, 13% out-of-distribution on SIMPLER, and 14% task progress gain on PolaRiS benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed CoVer framework effectively narrows the gap between intent and action in robots, advancing real-world applications of Vision-Language-Action systems.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

*Ziyi Yang,Kalit Inani,Keshav Kabra,Vima Gupta,Anand Padmanabha Iyer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAFuzz, a hybrid testing framework that uses LLM-guided adaptive fuzzing to efficiently detect algorithmic vulnerabilities, outperforming traditional methods in precision and time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current testing frameworks struggle to keep up with the increasing volume of AI-generated code, leading to inefficient resource use and missed vulnerabilities due to their lack of algorithmic vulnerability awareness.

Method: The proposed system, SAFuzz, incorporates LLM-guided adaptive fuzzing through features like prompt-based diversification, problem-specific oracle-guided harness generation, and an LLM-based predictor for resource allocation and early stopping.

Result: SAFuzz achieves an 85.7% vulnerability discrimination precision (up from 77.9%), reduces time cost by 1.71x compared to GreenFuzz, and complements unit test generation methods to enhance bug detection recall from 67.3% to 79.5%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLM-guided testing approaches with traditional methods, improving precision, efficiency, and recall in algorithmic vulnerability detection.

Abstract: While AI-coding assistants accelerate software development, current testing frameworks struggle to keep pace with the resulting volume of AI-generated code. Traditional fuzzing techniques often allocate resources uniformly and lack semantic awareness of algorithmic vulnerability patterns, leading to inefficient resource usage and missed vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid testing framework that leverages LLM-guided adaptive fuzzing to detect algorithmic vulnerabilities efficiently. Our system SAFuzz integrates prompt-based behavioral diversification, harness generation with problem-specific oracles, and an LLM-based predictor to enable adaptive resource allocation and dynamic early stopping. Evaluating SAFuzz on CSES algorithmic problems, we improve vulnerability discrimination precision from 77.9% to 85.7% and achieve a 1.71x reduction in time cost compared to SOTA GreenFuzz while maintaining comparable recall. We further observe that combining our approach with existing unit test generation methods yields complementary gains, increasing the bug detection recall from 67.3% to 79.5%.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-MiniSandbox is a lightweight, container-free method for scalable training of reinforcement learning agents in software engineering, reducing storage and setup time while maintaining isolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of container-based methods in RL training pipelines, such as high storage overhead and slow environment setup, and to create a more efficient and accessible alternative.

Method: SWE-MiniSandbox replaces per-task container isolation with kernel-level isolated workspaces and leverages pre-caching techniques to avoid the need for bulky container images.

Result: The method reduces disk usage to 5% and environment preparation time to 25% of container-based baselines while achieving equivalent evaluation performance.

Conclusion: SWE-MiniSandbox provides a scalable and efficient alternative to container-based RL training pipelines, particularly suitable for resource-constrained research settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training software engineering (SWE) agents, but existing pipelines typically rely on per-task containers for isolation. At scale, pre-built container images incur substantial storage overhead, slow environment setup, and require container-management privileges. We propose SWE-MiniSandbox, a lightweight, container-free method that enables scalable RL training of SWE agents without sacrificing isolation. Instead of relying on per-instance containers, SWE-MiniSandbox executes each task in an isolated workspace backed by kernel-level mechanisms, substantially reducing system overhead. It leverages lightweight environment pre-caching techniques to eliminate the need for bulky container images. As a result, our approach lowers disk usage to approximately 5\% of that required by container-based pipelines and reduces environment preparation time to about 25\% of the container baseline. Empirical results demonstrate that SWE-MiniSandbox achieves evaluation performance comparable to standard container-based pipelines. By removing the dependency on heavy container infrastructure, SWE-MiniSandbox offers a practical and accessible foundation for scaling RL-based SWE agents, particularly in resource-constrained research environments.

Motivation: To address the limitations of current fragmented and reactive healthcare systems by proposing Patient Medical Digital Twins (PMDTs) for holistic and adaptive chronic care.

Method: The paper uses ontology-driven modeling and federated analytics pilots, aligned with HL7 FHIR and OMOP standards. It integrates insights from oncology studies and distributed AI platforms.

Result: The research demonstrates feasibility through the QUALITOP oncology study, distributed AI analytics, and technical progress in predictive analytics, while identifying challenges such as privacy governance and interface design.

Conclusion: Actionable insights are provided for software engineers to advance PMDTs using DSLs and model-driven engineering, with a vision for trust and adaptability in chronic healthcare systems.

Abstract: Chronic diseases constitute the principal burden of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs worldwide, yet current health systems remain fragmented and predominantly reactive. Patient Medical Digital Twins (PMDTs) offer a paradigm shift: holistic, continuously updated digital counterparts of patients that integrate clinical, genomic, lifestyle, and quality-of-life data. We report early implementations of PMDTs via ontology-driven modeling and federated analytics pilots. Insights from the QUALITOP oncology study and a distributed AI platform confirm both feasibility and challenges: aligning with HL7 FHIR and OMOP standards, embedding privacy governance, scaling federated queries, and designing intuitive clinician interfaces. We also highlight technical gains, such as automated reasoning over multimodal blueprints and predictive analytics for patient outcomes.

### [424] [Agent-Diff: Benchmarking LLM Agents on Enterprise API Tasks via Code Execution with State-Diff-Based Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11224)
*Hubert M. Pysklo,Artem Zhuravel,Patrick D. Watson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Agent-Diff is a framework that evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) on real-world tasks involving external APIs, combining the advantages of sandboxed and realistic benchmarking approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reliable benchmarking framework that evaluates agentic LLMs on diverse real-world tasks, addressing variations in models, tools, and environments while maintaining ecological validity.

Method: The authors introduced a sandboxing approach coupled with real API interactions, using a state-diff contract to measure task success and a standardized scripting layer for external API execution.

Result: The framework evaluated nine different LLMs across 224 tasks involving enterprise software workflows, and conducted ablation experiments to measure framework robustness with API documentation.

Conclusion: Agent-Diff provides a standardized and ecologically valid benchmarking tool, enabling a consistent evaluation of LLMs' performance on real-world use cases using external services.

Abstract: We present Agent-Diff, a novel benchmarking framework for evaluating agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on real-world tasks that execute code via external APIs. Agentic LLM performance varies due to differences in models, external tool access, prompt structures, and agentic frameworks. Benchmarks must make fundamental trade-offs between a sandboxed approach that controls for variation in software environments and more ecologically valid approaches employing real services. Agent-Diff attempts to capture the desirable features of both of these approaches by including access to the real API interfaces for software services while sandboxing the environment in which calls are made, processed, and evaluated. This approach relies on two key innovations. The first is a novel state-diff contract, which separates process from outcome - rather than fuzzy trace or parameter matching, we define task success as whether the expected change in environment state was achieved. The second is a novel sandbox that provides a standardized scripting layer that all models use to execute code against external APIs (Slack, Box, Linear, Google Calendar). Thus, we can evaluate different agentic LLMs against a standardized set of contracts using a unified sandbox while still evaluating their performance on real-world service interfaces. Using the Agent-Diff framework, we provide benchmarks for nine LLMs across 224 tasks utilizing enterprise software workflows. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of the framework with ablation experiments to assess the contribution of access to API documentation on benchmark performance.

*Yang Liu,Armstrong Foundjem,Xingfang Wu,Heng Li,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for coding tasks using perturbed data to enhance robustness at minimal performance cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the robustness of LLMs in handling varied inputs for coding tasks, as vulnerabilities may lead to incorrect or insecure code outputs.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs using datasets with character-level, word-level, and sentence-level perturbations, and comparing robustness and performance against base models and unperturbed datasets.

Result: Perturbed dataset fine-tuning improves robustness significantly (by 4%-6%) but may cause a slight 1%-3% performance decrease, with occasional performance improvements.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning with perturbed data is effective for improving robustness, though it entails minor trade-offs in performance. Balancing robustness and performance is critical for coding applications.

Abstract: Context: In the fast-paced evolution of software development, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for tasks such as code generation, completion, analysis, and bug fixing. Ensuring the robustness of these models against potential vulnerabilities from handling diverse inputs is critical, as variations in input can lead to incorrect or insecure code outputs.
  Objective: This work aims to improve the robustness of LLMs for coding-related tasks against potential adversarial inputs. Specifically, we investigate how fine-tuning LLMs with perturbed datasets impacts their robustness against input perturbations.
  Method: We systematically evaluated LLM robustness by fine-tuning models using datasets perturbed at character-level, word-level, and sentence-level, comparing results against base models and models fine-tuned on unperturbed datasets.
  Results: Fine-tuning LLMs with perturbed datasets significantly improves model robustness (RD usually drops around 4\% - 6\%), especially for models with relatively weak robustness. However, this fine-tuning process typically results in a slight performance decrease (pass@1 usually drops around 1\% - 3\%) compared to fine-tuning with unperturbed datasets, although occasional performance improvements are observed.
  Conclusion \& Implications: Fine-tuning LLMs for coding tasks with perturbed data effectively enhances their robustness at the cost of a minor performance reduction, emphasizing the importance of balancing the robustness and performance of LLMs for coding applications.

*Haolin Li,Michael Coblenz*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores how professional software developers debug in real-world contexts, proposing a theory of debugging as an iterative diagnostic process influenced by mental modeling, reasoning strategies, and external resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of how experienced developers approach debugging in large, complex, real-world codebases. This study aims to bridge the gap by uncovering their reasoning and strategies.

Method: The researchers conducted a qualitative study using a grounded theory approach, observing 12 professional developers across various debugging tasks in their own codebases to collect data.

Result: The study found debugging to be an iterative diagnostic process, involving mental model construction, information gathering through navigation and execution, and adaptation of strategies based on codebase context, complexity, and familiarity.

Conclusion: The study introduces a grounded theory of professional debugging, highlighting its human-centered dimensions and providing insights for improving tool design and education in software engineering.

Abstract: Debugging is a central yet complex activity in software engineering. Prior studies have documented debugging strategies and tool usage, but little theory explains how experienced developers reason about bugs in large, real-world codebases. We conducted a qualitative study using a grounded theory approach. We observed seven professional developers and five professional live-coding streamers working on 17 debugging tasks in their own codebases, capturing diverse contexts of debugging. We theorize debugging as a structured, iterative diagnostic process in which programmers update a mental model of the system to guide information gathering. Developers gather information by alternating between navigation and execution strategies, employing forward and backward tracing modes of reasoning and adapting these approaches according to codebase context, complexity, and familiarity. Developers also gather external resources to complement code-based evidence, with their experience enabling them to systematically construct a mental model. We contribute a grounded theory of professional debugging that surfaces the human-centered dimensions of the practice, with implications for tool design and software engineering education.

*Zixuan Feng,Katie Kimura,Bianca Trinkenreich,Igor Steinmacher,Marco Gerosa,Anita Sarma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates contributor retention in open-source software (OSS) communities, developing predictive strategies and tools to address disengagement risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source software (OSS) communities struggle with contributor retention as tools fail to predict disengagement, posing challenges for managers to take proactive steps.

Method: The authors used a Design Science Research approach, combining interviews, surveys, literature review, iterative prototype development, and in situ evaluations.

Result: The study provided empirical insights into retention challenges, developed actionable strategies, and created a web-based prototype tested by 100+ OSS practitioners in two communities.

Conclusion: A practical framework was offered for OSS community managers to better manage contributor retention and for future research on OSS sustainability theories.

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) community managers face significant challenges in retaining contributors, as they must monitor activity and engagement while navigating complex dynamics of collaboration. Current tools designed for managing contributor retention (e.g., dashboards) fall short by providing retrospective rather than predictive insights to identify potential disengagement early. Without understanding how to anticipate and prevent disengagement, new solutions risk burdening community managers rather than supporting retention management. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we employed a mixed-methods approach for problem identification and solution design to address contributor retention. To identify the challenges hindering retention management in OSS, we conducted semi-structured interviews, a multi-vocal literature review, and community surveys. Then through an iterative build-evaluate cycle, we developed and refined strategies for diagnosing retention risks and informing engagement efforts. We operationalized these strategies into a web-based prototype, incorporating feedback from 100+ OSS practitioners, and conducted an in situ evaluation across two OSS communities. Our study offers (1) empirical insights into the challenges of contributor retention management in OSS, (2) actionable strategies that support OSS community managers' retention efforts, and (3) a practical framework for future research in developing or validating theories about OSS sustainability.

TL;DR: SB-QOPS improves quantum software testing by using commuting Pauli strings, achieving better fault detection and portability across platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum software testing methods face challenges like reliance on simple inputs, costly specifications, and limited validation on real quantum devices.

Method: Proposes SB-QOPS by redefining test cases using commuting Pauli strings and introducing a measurement-centric oracle, supported by expectation-based fitness functions and various search strategies.

Result: Experiments showed SB-QOPS achieves 100% fault detection in circuits up to 29 qubits, performing well under noisy conditions across IBM, IQM, and Quantinuum platforms.

Conclusion: SB-QOPS is a significant improvement on quantum testing approaches, enabling efficient and effective testing with high fault detection and cross-platform compatibility.

Abstract: Quantum software testing is important for reliable quantum software engineering. Despite recent advances, existing quantum software testing approaches rely on simple test inputs and statistical oracles, costly program specifications, and limited validation on real quantum computers. To address these challenges, we propose SB-QOPS, a search-based quantum program testing approach via commuting Pauli strings. SB-QOPS, as a direct extension to a previously proposed QOPS approach, redefines test cases in terms of Pauli strings and introduces a measurement-centric oracle that exploits their commutation properties, enabling effective testing of quantum programs while reducing the need for full program specifications. By systematically exploring the search space through an expectation-value-based fitness function, SB-QOPS improves test budget utilization and increases the likelihood of uncovering subtle faults. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation on quantum circuits of up to 29 qubits on real quantum computers and emulators. We assess three search strategies: Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing, and the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm, and evaluate SB-QOPS under both simulated and real noisy conditions. Experiments span three quantum computing platforms: IBM, IQM, and Quantinuum. Results show that SB-QOPS significantly outperforms QOPS, achieving a fault-detection score of 100% for circuits up to 29 qubits, and demonstrating portability across quantum platforms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a six-level GUI Agent Autonomy Levels (GAL) framework to clarify and categorize the autonomy of GUI agents for improving trustworthy interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ambiguity and confusion surrounding the autonomy levels of GUI agents, and to provide clarity for understanding their capabilities, responsibilities, and risks.

Method: The authors propose a six-level framework, termed GUI Agent Autonomy Levels (GAL), to explicitly categorize the degrees of autonomy in GUI agents and aid in assessing their trustworthiness.

Result: The framework offers a structured way to understand and classify GUI agent autonomy, helping measure progress in software interaction development.

Conclusion: The GAL framework contributes to conceptual clarity and helps build benchmarks for creating and trusting autonomous GUI agents in modern interaction systems.

Abstract: GUI agents are rapidly becoming a new interaction to software, allowing people to navigate web, desktop and mobile rather than execute them click by click. Yet ``agent'' is described with radically different degrees of autonomy, obscuring capability, responsibility and risk. We call for conceptual clarity through GUI Agent Autonomy Levels (GAL), a six-level framework that makes autonomy explicit and helps benchmark progress toward trustworthy software interaction.

*Minh Le-Anh,Huyen Nguyen,Khanh An Tran,Nam Le Hai,Linh Ngo Van,Nghi D. Q. Bui,Bach Le*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeLLMs excel in singular code tasks but struggle in repository-level applications due to structural and contextual limitations. The paper introduces Hydra, addressing these issues to enhance repository-level code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CodeLLMs face challenges in repository-level tasks because existing methods lack the ability to fully capture code dependencies and structural coherence.

Method: Hydra utilizes structure-aware indexing, dependency-aware retriever (DAR), and hybrid retrieval techniques to represent code repositories as hierarchical trees and enhance contextual understanding for code generation.

Result: Hydra achieves state-of-the-art results on critical benchmarks, surpassing leading baselines by over 5% in Pass@1, and enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones using existing retrieval mechanisms.

Conclusion: Hydra improves repository-level code generation by addressing structural and dependency limitations in existing systems, demonstrating its effectiveness across various CodeLLMs.

Abstract: Large language models for code (CodeLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in standalone code completion and generation, sometimes even surpassing human performance, yet their effectiveness diminishes in repository-level settings where cross-file dependencies and structural context are essential. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches often borrow strategies from NLP, relying on chunking-based indexing and similarity-based retrieval. Chunking results in the loss of coherence between code units and overlooks structural relationships, while similarity-driven methods frequently miss functionally relevant dependencies such as helper functions, classes, or global variables. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a repository-level code generation framework that treats code as structured code rather than natural language. Our approach introduces (i) a structure-aware indexing strategy that represents repositories as hierarchical trees of functions, classes, and variables, preserving code structure and dependencies, (ii) a lightweight dependency-aware retriever (DAR) that explicitly identifies and retrieves the true dependencies required by a target function, and (iii) a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines DAR with similarity-based retrieval to provide both essential building blocks and practical usage examples. Extensive experiments on the challenging DevEval and RepoExec benchmarks, both requiring function implementation from real-world repositories with complex large repository context, show that Hydra achieves state-of-the-art performance across open- and closed-source CodeLLMs. Notably, our method establishes a new state of the art in repository-level code generation, surpassing strongest baseline by over 5% in Pass@1 and even enabling smaller models to match or exceed the performance of much larger ones that rely on existing retrievers.

TL;DR: Current OSS project recommendation systems often overlook collaboration and community aspects, which are crucial for contributors' project selection decisions. This study focuses on team dynamics in OSS communities and their alignment with contributors' motivations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in OSS project recommendation systems, which prioritize technical attributes over social and collaboration aspects that influence contributors’ project involvement.

Method: Conducted an online survey of 198 OSS practitioners, employing both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate perceptions of team dynamics in OSS communities.

Result: Findings indicate communication-related team dynamics such as responsiveness, tone, and clarity are widely valued. Contributors motivated by reputation or networking prefer inclusive projects encouraging diverse participation.

Conclusion: Understanding team dynamics and their alignment with contributor motivations is essential for designing effective, human-aware OSS project recommendation systems emphasizing social collaboration quality.

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) development relies on effective collaboration among distributed contributors. Yet, current OSS project recommendation systems primarily emphasize technical attributes, overlooking the collaboration and community aspects that influence contributors' decisions to join and remain in projects. This study investigates how team dynamics within OSS communities influence project selection and how these preferences vary across contributors' motivations. We conducted an online survey with 198 OSS practitioners, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to capture contributors' perceptions of team dynamics. The results reveal that communication-related team dynamics such as responsiveness, tone, and clarity of replies are consistently prioritized across practitioners. However, the relative importance of these team dynamics differs according to contributors' motivations. For instance, practitioners motivated by gaining reputation or networking preferred inclusive project communities that encouraged diverse participation. These findings highlight that understanding how team dynamics align with contributors' motivations provides valuable insights into practitioners' project selection behaviour. Those insights can inform the design of future human-aware project recommendation systems that better account for social collaboration quality and motivational fit.

### [432] [WebTestPilot: Agentic End-to-End Web Testing against Natural Language Specification by Inferring Oracles with Symbolized GUI Elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11724)
*Xiwen Teoh,Yun Lin,Duc-Minh Nguyen,Ruofei Ren,Wenjie Zhang,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces WebTestPilot, a refined LLM-based agent for automating end-to-end web testing, which effectively addresses the challenges of oracle inference and inconsistent reasoning by symbolizing GUI elements and validating implicit requirements. It surpasses existing baselines in precision and recall for bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges in automating web testing using visual language models, specifically addressing issues of language model hallucinations and unreliable oracle inference.

Method: WebTestPilot utilizes a symbolization layer to convert critical GUI elements into symbols and translates natural language specifications into actionable sequences governed by inferred pre- and post-conditions to act as oracles.

Result: WebTestPilot achieves high performance with a task completion rate of 99%, precision of 96%, and recall of 96% in bug detection, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: WebTestPilot successfully addresses the implicit oracle and probabilistic inference challenges, demonstrating strong capabilities in web testing automation and generalization across diverse inputs and scales.

Abstract: Visual language model (VLM) agents show great promise in automating end-to-end (E2E) web testing against requirements in natural language. However, the probabilistic nature of language models can have inherent hallucinations. Therefore, given a detected inconsistency between the requirement and the web application, it is hard to distinguish whether it stems from the hallucination or a real application bug. Addressing this issue presents two core technical challenges: the implicit oracle inference challenge, where the agent must act as its own oracle to implicitly decide if the application's behavior is correct without guidance, and the probabilistic inference challenge, where an LLM's inconsistent reasoning undermines its trustworthiness as an oracle. Existing LLM-based approaches fail to capture such implicit oracles, either by treating any page navigation that doesn't crash as a success, or by checking each state in isolation, thus missing bugs dependent on context from prior steps.
  We introduce WebTestPilot, an LLM-based agent designed to address these challenges. WebTestPilot uses (1) a symbolization layer which detects and symbolizes critical GUI elements on the web application into symbols (i.e., variables) and (2) translates natural language specification into a sequence of steps, each of which is equipped with inferred pre- and post-conditions over the symbols as an oracle. This oracle captures data, temporal, and causal dependencies, enabling the validation of implicit requirements. To advance research in this area, we build a benchmark of bug-injected web apps for evaluating NL-to-E2E testing. The results show that WebTestPilot achieves a task completion rate of 99%, with 96% precision and 96% recall in bug detection, outperforming the best baseline (+70 precision, +27 recall). The agent generalizes across diverse natural language inputs and model scales.

### [433] [Leveraging Language Models to Discover Evidence-Based Actions for OSS Sustainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11746)
*Nafiz Imtiaz Khan,Vladimir Filkov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel pipeline using LLMs to extract actionable recommendations from software engineering literature to aid OSS project sustainability, filtering and organizing them into quality-assured practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Open Source Software projects fail to achieve sustainability, despite the existence of predictive models. These models lack actionable advice and fail to leverage extensive research on OSS practices.

Method: The authors designed a RAG-pipeline with two-layer prompting strategy, systematically exploring LLM techniques to extract evidence-backed actions from ICSE and FSE papers while filtering hallucinations and assessing soundness.

Result: A total of 1,922 actionable recommendations (ReACTs) were extracted, with 1,312 passing strict quality tests, categorized into practice-oriented groups linked to project signals.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap between OSS sustainability research and practical implementation, providing a scalable approach to convert research insights into structured, actionable strategies for OSS projects.

Abstract: When successful, Open Source Software (OSS) projects create enormous value, but most never reach a sustainable state. Recent work has produced accurate models that forecast OSS sustainability, yet these models rarely tell maintainers what to do: their features are often high-level socio-technical signals that are not directly actionable. Decades of empirical software engineering research have accumulated a large but underused body of evidence on concrete practices that improve project health.
  We close this gap by using LLMs as evidence miners over the SE literature. We design a RAG-pipeline and a two-layer prompting strategy that extract researched actionables (ReACTs): concise, evidence-linked recommendations mapping to specific OSS practices. In the first layer, we systematically explore open LLMs and prompting techniques, selecting the best-performing combination to derive candidate ReACTs from 829 ICSE and FSE papers. In the second layer, we apply follow-up prompting to filter hallucinations, extract impact and evidence, and assess soundness and precision.
  Our pipeline yields 1,922 ReACTs, of which 1,312 pass strict quality criteria and are organized into practice-oriented categories connectable to project signals from tools like APEX. The result is a reproducible, scalable approach turning scattered research findings into structured, evidence-based actions guiding OSS projects toward sustainability.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AmbiBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate Mobile GUI Agents' ability to align with user intent, even when given unclear or incomplete instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks assume instructions are clear and complete, which neglects real-world scenarios where users often provide ambiguous or incomplete instructions.

Method: The authors developed AmbiBench, which categorizes instruction clarity into four levels and includes a dataset of 240 realistic tasks. They also designed MUSE, an automated evaluation framework to assess agent performance using various metrics.

Result: AmbiBench highlights the performance limitations of current agents under different instruction clarity levels, demonstrating the benefits of active interaction and validating MUSE's alignment with human judgment.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new standard that shifts focus from simple execution to enhanced user-intent alignment, paving the way for future agents capable of understanding and interacting effectively with users.

Abstract: Benchmarks are paramount for gauging progress in the domain of Mobile GUI Agents. In practical scenarios, users frequently fail to articulate precise directives containing full task details at the onset, and their expressions are typically ambiguous. Consequently, agents are required to converge on the user's true intent via active clarification and interaction during execution. However, existing benchmarks predominantly operate under the idealized assumption that user-issued instructions are complete and unequivocal. This paradigm focuses exclusively on assessing single-turn execution while overlooking the alignment capability of the agent. To address this limitation, we introduce AmbiBench, the first benchmark incorporating a taxonomy of instruction clarity to shift evaluation from unidirectional instruction following to bidirectional intent alignment. Grounded in Cognitive Gap theory, we propose a taxonomy of four clarity levels: Detailed, Standard, Incomplete, and Ambiguous. We construct a rigorous dataset of 240 ecologically valid tasks across 25 applications, subject to strict review protocols. Furthermore, targeting evaluation in dynamic environments, we develop MUSE (Mobile User Satisfaction Evaluator), an automated framework utilizing an MLLM-as-a-judge multi-agent architecture. MUSE performs fine-grained auditing across three dimensions: Outcome Effectiveness, Execution Quality, and Interaction Quality. Empirical results on AmbiBench reveal the performance boundaries of SoTA agents across different clarity levels, quantify the gains derived from active interaction, and validate the strong correlation between MUSE and human judgment. This work redefines evaluation standards, laying the foundation for next-generation agents capable of truly understanding user intent.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method leveraging zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) to verify source code provenance by providing cryptographic proofs during compilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the compiled binary truly originates from its claimed source code is critical for security, but current methods like reproducible builds are complex and inefficient in practice.

Method: The authors propose using zkVMs to execute compilers, generating cryptographic proofs that link compiled binaries to the specified source code and compiler.

Result: The method was successfully tested with RISC Zero zkVM and ChibiCC on various synthetic programs and real-world software (OpenSSL, libsodium), effectively countering attacks such as compiler substitution and source tampering.

Conclusion: Using zkVMs for compilation offers robust security guarantees, demonstrating its applicability for real-world software and addressing gaps in current source code provenance verification techniques.

Abstract: Verifying that a compiled binary originates from its claimed source code is a fundamental security requirement, called source code provenance. Achieving verifiable source code provenance in practice remains challenging. The most popular technique, called reproducible builds, requires difficult matching and reexecution of build toolchains and environments. We propose a novel approach to verifiable provenance based on compiling software with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). By executing a compiler within a zkVM, our system produces both the compiled output and a cryptographic proof attesting that the compilation was performed on the claimed source code with the claimed compiler. We implement a proof-of-concept implementation using the RISC Zero zkVM and the ChibiCC C compiler, and evaluate it on 200 synthetic programs as well as 31 OpenSSL and 21 libsodium source files. Our results show that zk-compilation is applicable to real-world software and provides strong security guarantees: all adversarial tests targeting compiler substitution, source tampering, output manipulation, and replay attacks are successfully blocked.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates using large language models (LLMs) to support co-evolution of textual DSL grammars and instances, achieving good performance on small-scale cases but facing challenges with larger instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Languages evolve, but traditional model-driven approaches may lose human-relevant details like layout and comments when textual domain-specific languages (DSLs) adapt to grammar changes.

Method: Systematic evaluation of Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across 10 case languages (10 runs each), focusing on correctness and preservation of human information in grammar-instance co-evolution.

Result: Strong performance on small instances (≥94% precision and recall under 20 modified lines), but degradation in larger-scale cases; e.g., GPT struggles at high complexity, whereas Claude maintains 85% recall at 40 lines.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for small-scale DSL grammar co-evolution but face scalability limits and performance complexities that influence their feasibility in larger settings.

Abstract: Software languages evolve over time for reasons such as feature additions. When grammars evolve, textual instances that originally conformed to them may become outdated. While model-driven engineering provides many techniques for co-evolving models with metamodel changes, these approaches are not designed for textual DSLs and may lose human-relevant information such as layout and comments. This study systematically evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for co-evolving grammars and instances of textual DSLs. Using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across ten case languages with ten runs each, we assess both correctness and preservation of human-oriented information. Results show strong performance on small-scale cases ($\geq$94% precision and recall for instances requiring fewer than 20 modified lines), but performance degraded with scale: Claude maintains 85% recall at 40 lines, while GPT fails on the largest instances. Response time increases substantially with instance size, and grammar evolution complexity and deletion granularity affect performance more than change type. These findings clarify when LLM-based co-evolution is effective and where current limitations remain.

TL;DR: The study analyzes the use of smaller language models (SLMs) as code correctness judges, showing they outperform older methods like RankEF and compete with larger models affordably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable cost-effective code generation and evaluation for less common programming languages, avoiding the high costs associated with massive LLMs.

Method: The authors trained several state-of-the-art SLMs to judge code correctness, comparing their accuracy in classifying correct and incorrect implementations with previous models.

Result: Modern SLMs were found to outperform the RankEF model, even without execution-based information. They also rivaled much larger models at significantly lower costs when used for code ranking.

Conclusion: SLMs prove to be a viable and cost-efficient alternative for companies to train and deploy effective code generators on par with larger and more expensive LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in automated code generation. While effective for mainstream languages, they may underperform on less common or domain-specific languages, prompting companies to develop in-house code generators. While open-source models can be trained for this, only LLMs with tens of billions of parameters match the performance of commercial tools, demanding costly training and deployment. Recent work proposed supporting code generation with smaller models (SLMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and using another SLM to select the most likely correct one. The most recent work in this area is the one by Sun et al. [29] presenting RankEF, a T5 model trained to rank code solutions using both execution-based and non-execution-based information. However, Sun et al. do not assess the T5 ranker's classification accuracy, that is, how often it misjudges correct implementations as incorrect or vice versa, leaving open questions about the reliability of LMs as code correctness judges for other tasks (e.g., automated code review). Moreover, their experiments involve relatively old models, making it unclear the extent to which such a methodology would still help companies in cheaply training their own code generators with performance comparable to those of massive LLMs. We present a study addressing these limitations. We train several state-of-the-art SLMs as code correctness judges and assess their ability to discriminate between correct and wrong implementations. We show that modern SLMs outperform RankEF, even without exploiting execution-based information. When used as code rankers, they achieve higher performance gains than RankEF and perform competitively with LLMs 5-25x larger, at a fraction of the cost.

Result: ChatGPT-4 generates more comments (~2.4x) than humans but only identifies 10% of the quality issues highlighted by human reviewers. About 40% of AI-generated comments reveal meaningful quality concerns.

Conclusion: While ChatGPT complements human reviews and adds value as an additional check, it cannot fully substitute manual review and increases the workload due to required validation by humans.

Abstract: Several Deep Learning (DL)-based techniques have been proposed to automate code review. Still, it is unclear the extent to which these approaches can recommend quality improvements as a human reviewer. We study the similarities and differences between code reviews performed by humans and those automatically generated by DL models, using ChatGPT-4 as representative of the latter. In particular, we run a mining-based study in which we collect and manually inspect 739 comments posted by human reviewers to suggest code changes in 240 PRs. The manual inspection aims at classifying the type of quality improvement recommended by human reviewers (e.g., rename variable/constant). Then, we ask ChatGPT to perform a code review on the same PRs and we compare the quality improvements it recommends against those suggested by the human reviewers. We show that while, on average, ChatGPT tends to recommend a higher number of code changes as compared to human reviewers (~2.4x more), it can only spot 10% of the quality issues reported by humans. However, ~40% of the additional comments generated by the LLM point to meaningful quality issues. In short, our findings show the complementarity of manual and AI-based code review. This finding suggests that, in its current state, DL-based code review can be used as a further quality check on top of the one performed by humans, but should not be considered as a valid alternative to them nor as a mean to save code review time, since human reviewers would still need to perform their manual inspection while also validating the quality issues reported by the DL-based technique.

### [439] [Evaluating AGENTS.md: Are Repository-Level Context Files Helpful for Coding Agents?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988)
*Thibaud Gloaguen,Niels Mündler,Mark Müller,Veselin Raychev,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of context files (like AGENTS.md) used for coding agents in software development, finding they tend to reduce task success rates while increasing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze whether repository-specific context files effectively enhance real-world task performance of coding agents.

Method: The study evaluates coding agents in two settings: (1) Established SWE-bench tasks with LLM-generated context files following developer guidelines and (2) Issues from repositories with developer-provided context files.

Result: The research demonstrates that context files lower task success rates, increase inference costs by more than 20%, promote broader exploration behaviors, and show that coding agents generally respect provided instructions.

Conclusion: Unnecessary requirements in context files complicate tasks, and human-written context files should focus on minimal requirements.

Abstract: A widespread practice in software development is to tailor coding agents to repositories using context files, such as AGENTS.md, by either manually or automatically generating them. Although this practice is strongly encouraged by agent developers, there is currently no rigorous investigation into whether such context files are actually effective for real-world tasks. In this work, we study this question and evaluate coding agents' task completion performance in two complementary settings: established SWE-bench tasks from popular repositories, with LLM-generated context files following agent-developer recommendations, and a novel collection of issues from repositories containing developer-committed context files.
  Across multiple coding agents and LLMs, we find that context files tend to reduce task success rates compared to providing no repository context, while also increasing inference cost by over 20%. Behaviorally, both LLM-generated and developer-provided context files encourage broader exploration (e.g., more thorough testing and file traversal), and coding agents tend to respect their instructions. Ultimately, we conclude that unnecessary requirements from context files make tasks harder, and human-written context files should describe only minimal requirements.

### [440] [An Empirical Study of the Imbalance Issue in Software Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12038)
*Yuejun Guo,Qiang Hu,Qiang Tang,Yves Le Traon*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the imbalance issue in DL-based vulnerability detection and its impact on model performance, confirming conjectures through empirical study on nine datasets and two models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the observed variability in performance of DL-based vulnerability detection models, hypothesizing that data imbalance in code vulnerability detection is a major factor causing this variability.

Method: The authors conducted an empirical study across nine datasets and two DL models, analyzing the performance of various imbalance solutions against metrics like precision, recall, and F1-measure.

Result: The study discovered that different imbalance solutions perform distinctively across datasets and evaluation metrics. Insights include focal loss improving precision, mean false error and class-balanced loss favoring recall, and random over-sampling enhancing F1-measure.

Conclusion: Existing imbalance solutions for vulnerability detection are not universally effective, and further exploration is required to design new, adaptable solutions for better performance across varying datasets and metrics.

Abstract: Vulnerability detection is crucial to protect software security. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is the most promising technique to automate this detection task, leveraging its superior ability to extract patterns and representations within extensive code volumes. Despite its promise, DL-based vulnerability detection remains in its early stages, with model performance exhibiting variability across datasets. Drawing insights from other well-explored application areas like computer vision, we conjecture that the imbalance issue (the number of vulnerable code is extremely small) is at the core of the phenomenon. To validate this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study involving nine open-source datasets and two state-of-the-art DL models. The results confirm our conjecture. We also obtain insightful findings on how existing imbalance solutions perform in vulnerability detection. It turns out that these solutions perform differently as well across datasets and evaluation metrics. Specifically: 1) Focal loss is more suitable to improve the precision, 2) mean false error and class-balanced loss encourages the recall, and 3) random over-sampling facilitates the F1-measure. However, none of them excels across all metrics. To delve deeper, we explore external influences on these solutions and offer insights for developing new solutions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ModelWisdom, an interactive tool enhancing TLA+ model checking by offering visualization, optimization, summarization, and debugging capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners face difficulty with interpreting counterexamples and managing large state-transition graphs due to limited explainability and manual effort required in tracing violations.

Method: The authors developed ModelWisdom, integrating visualization techniques, large language models, and optimization strategies to improve interpretability and functionality of TLA+ model checking.

Result: ModelWisdom offers visualization, graph optimization, semantic summarization, and supports iterative debugging to streamline the model-checking process.

Conclusion: ModelWisdom transforms raw model-checker output into an interactive, explainable workflow, simplifying understanding and debugging for complex TLA+ specifications.

Abstract: Model checking in TLA+ provides strong correctness guarantees, yet practitioners continue to face significant challenges in interpreting counterexamples, understanding large state-transition graphs, and repairing faulty models. These difficulties stem from the limited explainability of raw model-checker output and the substantial manual effort required to trace violations back to source specifications. Although the TLA+ Toolbox includes a state diagram viewer, it offers only a static, fully expanded graph without folding, color highlighting, or semantic explanations, which limits its scalability and interpretability. We present ModelWisdom, an interactive environment that uses visualization and large language models to make TLA+ model checking more interpretable and actionable. ModelWisdom offers: (i) Model Visualization, with colorized violation highlighting, click-through links from transitions to TLA+ code, and mapping between violating states and broken properties; (ii) Graph Optimization, including tree-based structuring and node/edge folding to manage large models; (iii) Model Digest, which summarizes and explains subgraphs via large language models (LLMs) and performs preprocessing and partial explanations; and (iv) Model Repair, which extracts error information and supports iterative debugging. Together, these capabilities turn raw model-checker output into an interactive, explainable workflow, improving understanding and reducing debugging effort for nontrivial TLA+ specifications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates performance antipatterns' effects not only on responsiveness but also on energy consumption in microservice systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unexplored relationship between performance antipatterns and their impact on energy consumption within microservice systems.

Method: Ten known antipatterns were implemented as microservices; their performance, power (CPU and DRAM), and resource utilization were measured under controlled conditions across repeated runs.

Result: Some antipatterns showed clear energy inefficiencies (e.g., Unnecessary Processing, The Ramp), linking increased response times to higher energy usage, while others had a capped power draw regardless of performance degradation.

Conclusion: The study identifies overlapping performance and energy antipatterns and provides insights for designing energy-efficient microservices systems.

Abstract: Performance antipatterns are known to degrade the responsiveness of microservice-based systems, but their impact on energy consumption remains largely unexplored. This paper empirically investigates whether widely studied performance antipatterns defined by Smith and Williams also negatively influence power usage. We implement ten antipatterns as isolated microservices and evaluate them under controlled load conditions, collecting synchronized measurements of performance, CPU and DRAM power consumption, and resource utilization across 30 repeated runs per antipattern. The results show that while all antipatterns degrade performance as expected, only a subset exhibit a statistically significant relationship between response time and increased power consumption. Specifically, several antipatterns reach CPU saturation, capping power draw regardless of rising response time, whereas others (\eg Unnecessary Processing, The Ramp) demonstrate energy-performance coupling indicative of inefficiency. Our results show that, while all injected performance antipatterns increase response time as expected, only a subset also behaves as clear energy antipatterns, with several cases reaching a nearly constant CPU power level where additional slowdowns mainly translate into longer execution time rather than higher instantaneous power consumption. The study provides a systematic foundation for identifying performance antipatterns that also behave as energy antipatterns and offers actionable insights for designing more energy-efficient microservices architectures.

Motivation: Energy efficiency is often overlooked in CI/CD pipelines for microservices, despite its significance and proven impact on design patterns, code smells, and refactorings.

Method: The authors developed PPTAM$η$, an automated tool integrated with GitLab CI for energy monitoring, utilizing load generators, container monitors, and hardware power probes to evaluate energy consumption at each commit.

Conclusion: Making energy consumption visible through pipelines enables developers to compare versions, test engineers to evaluate energy trends, and researchers to analyze impacts on microservice evolution.

Abstract: Modern container-based microservices evolve through rapid deployment cycles, but CI/CD pipelines still rarely measure energy consumption, even though prior work shows that design patterns, code smells and refactorings affect energy efficiency. We present PPTAM$η$, an automated pipeline that integrates power and energy measurement into GitLab CI for containerised API systems, coordinating load generation, container monitoring and hardware power probes to collect comparable metrics at each commit. The pipeline makes energy visible to developers, supports version comparison for test engineers and enables trend analysis for researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI coding agents impact mobile development and open-source projects, which has been underexplored.

Method: Empirical analysis of 2,901 AI-generated pull requests across 193 open-source Android and iOS repositories using the AIDev dataset.

Result: Android projects receive twice as many AI-authored pull requests compared to iOS, with higher acceptance rates (71% vs. 63%). Routine tasks see higher acceptance, while structural changes encounter lower success.

Conclusion: AI agents influence OSS mobile development, with Android showing higher receptivity. Findings provide benchmarks for evaluating AI-generated code contributions and design considerations for agentic systems.

Abstract: AI coding agents are increasingly contributing to software development, yet their impact on mobile development has received little empirical attention. In this paper, we present the first category-level empirical study of agent-generated code in open-source mobile app projects. We analyzed PR acceptance behaviors across mobile platforms, agents, and task categories using 2,901 AI-authored pull requests (PRs) in 193 verified Android and iOS open-source GitHub repositories in the AIDev dataset. We find that Android projects have received 2x more AI-authored PRs and have achieved higher PR acceptance rate (71%) than iOS (63%), with significant agent-level variation on Android. Across task categories, PRs with routine tasks (feature, fix, and ui) achieve the highest acceptance, while structural changes like refactor and build achieve lower success and longer resolution times. Furthermore, our evolution analysis shows improvement in PR resolution time on Android through mid-2025 before it declined again. Our findings offer the first evidence-based characterization of AI agents effects on OSS mobile projects and establish empirical baselines for evaluating agent-generated contributions to design platform aware agentic systems.

### [445] [Automated Test Suite Enhancement Using Large Language Models with Few-shot Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12256)
*Alex Chudic,Gül Çalıklı*

TL;DR: The paper explores the effect of few-shot prompting with different test artifact sources on the quality of LLM-generated unit tests, revealing that human-written examples yield the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the usability and effectiveness of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in generating high-quality and maintainable unit tests through few-shot learning in hybrid human-AI environments.

Method: Few-shot prompting with different test artifact sources (human-written, SBST, LLM-generated) evaluated on HumanEval and ClassEval datasets, testing retrieval-based example selection for quality improvement.

Result: Few-shot LLM-generated unit tests achieve improved coverage, correctness, readability, and maintainability, with human-written examples as the most effective source.

Conclusion: Few-shot prompting enhances the potential of LLMs in generating unit tests, with human-written examples and retrieval techniques yielding superior results for hybrid human-AI code environments.

Abstract: Unit testing is essential for verifying the functional correctness of code modules (e.g., classes, methods), but manually writing unit tests is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. Unit tests generated by tools that employ traditional approaches, such as search-based software testing (SBST), lack readability, naturalness, and practical usability. LLMs have recently provided promising results and become integral to developers' daily practices. Consequently, software repositories now include a mix of human-written tests, LLM-generated tests, and those from tools employing traditional approaches such as SBST. While LLMs' zero-shot capabilities have been widely studied, their few-shot learning potential for unit test generation remains underexplored. Few-shot prompting enables LLMs to learn from examples in the prompt, and automatically retrieving such examples could enhance test suites. This paper empirically investigates how few-shot prompting with different test artifact sources, comprising human, SBST, or LLM, affects the quality of LLM-generated unit tests as program comprehension artifacts and their contribution to improving existing test suites by evaluating not only correctness and coverage but also readability, cognitive complexity, and maintainability in hybrid human-AI codebases. We conducted experiments on HumanEval and ClassEval datasets using GPT-4o, which is integrated into GitHub Copilot and widely used among developers. We also assessed retrieval-based methods for selecting relevant examples. Our results show that LLMs can generate high-quality tests via few-shot prompting, with human-written examples producing the best coverage and correctness. Additionally, selecting examples based on the combined similarity of problem description and code consistently yields the most effective few-shot prompts.

TL;DR: The CL API offers a real-time Python-based interface for closed-loop experiments with Biological Neural Networks (BNNs), simplifying precise control and synchronization while enhancing accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-offs in existing methods for interacting with BNNs, which lack either hardware-level control or temporal/structural consistency needed for reproducible experiments.

Method: The paper introduces the CL API, a declarative Python interface. It uses contract-based API design to ensure real-time, sub-millisecond closed-loop interactions with BNNs, with precise stimulation semantics, deterministic ordering, and synchronization guarantees.

Result: The CL API allows non-expert users to conduct complex stimulation and closed-loop behavior experiments with BNNs while ensuring accuracy and accessibility without dealing with hardware complexity.

Conclusion: The CL API simplifies real-time experimentation and improves reproducibility with BNNs, facilitating advancements in biological research and neurocomputing applications.

Abstract: Biological neural networks (BNNs) are increasingly explored for their rich dynamics, parallelism, and adaptive behavior. Beyond understanding their function as a scientific endeavour, a key focus has been using these biological systems as a novel computing substrate. However, BNNs can only function as reliable information-processing systems if inputs are delivered in a temporally and structurally consistent manner. In practice, this requires stimulation with precisely controlled structure, microsecond-scale timing, multi-channel synchronization, and the ability to observe and respond to neural activity in real-time. Existing approaches to interacting with BNNs face a fundamental trade-off: they either depend on low-level hardware mechanisms, imposing prohibitive complexity for rapid iteration, or they sacrifice temporal and structural control, undermining consistency and reproducibility - particularly in closed-loop experiments. The Cortical Labs Application Programming Interface (CL API) enables real-time, sub-millisecond closed-loop interactions with BNNs. Taking a contract-based API design approach, the CL API provides users with precise stimulation semantics, transactional admission, deterministic ordering, and explicit synchronization guarantees. This contract is presented through a declarative Python interface, enabling non-expert programmers to express complex stimulation and closed-loop behavior without managing low-level scheduling or hardware details. Ultimately, the CL API provides an accessible and reproducible foundation for real-time experimentation with BNNs, supporting both fundamental biological research and emerging neurocomputing applications.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework integrating inter-level causation with dual-process theories to explain consciousness and cognitive functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between inter-level causation mechanisms and cognitive functions using dual-process theories as a unifying model.

Method: Proposed a model where supervenient functions (neural networks) interact through inter-level causation using algebraic expressions and feedback errors, aligning them with Type 1 and Type 2 processes from dual-process theories.

Result: The framework unifies consciousness, agency, and dual-process theories, naturally deriving the distinctive dynamics of Type 1 and Type 2 processes.

Conclusion: Inter-level causation, alongside dual-process theories, provides an integrative framework to model consciousness and cognitive processes effectively.

Abstract: Mental events are considered to supervene on physical events. A supervenient event does not change without a corresponding change in the underlying subvenient physical events. Since wholes and their parts exhibit the same supervenience-subvenience relations, inter-level causation has been expected to serve as a model for mental causation. We proposed an inter-level causation mechanism to construct a model of consciousness and an agent's self-determination. However, a significant gap exists between this mechanism and cognitive functions. Here, we demonstrate how to integrate the inter-level causation mechanism with the widely known dual-process theories. We assume that the supervenience level is composed of multiple supervenient functions (i.e., neural networks), and we argue that inter-level causation can be achieved by controlling the feedback error defined through changing algebraic expressions combining these functions. Using inter-level causation allows for a dual laws model in which each level possesses its own distinct dynamics. In this framework, the feedback error is determined independently by two processes: (1) the selection of equations combining supervenient functions, and (2) the negative feedback error reduction to satisfy the equations through adjustments of neurons and synapses. We interpret these two independent feedback controls as Type 1 and Type 2 processes in the dual process theories. As a result, theories of consciousness, agency, and dual process theory are unified into a single framework, and the characteristic features of Type 1 and Type 2 processes are naturally derived.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores task-specific priors in the visual system using a generative model and mouse neural data, showing that the visual cortex can flexibly learn contextual priors tailored to tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if visual cortices can flexibly acquire contextual priors to adapt to specific tasks, beyond static natural image statistics.

Method: The researchers developed a task-optimized generative model called Task-Amortized VAE (TAVAE) and compared its outputs with neural recordings from mice performing similar visual discrimination tasks.

Result: Mismatch in learned task statistics revealed uncertainty in responses and accounted for characteristics of V1 population activity, demonstrating task priors in a neural context.

Conclusion: The visual system can dynamically learn and apply task-specific priors at early cortical levels, aiding task performance and sensory interpretations.

Abstract: The brain interprets visual information through learned regularities, a computation formalized as probabilistic inference under a prior. The visual cortex establishes priors for this inference, some delivered through established top-down connections that inform low-level cortices about statistics represented at higher levels in the cortical hierarchy. While evidence shows that adaptation leads to priors reflecting the structure of natural images, it remains unclear whether similar priors can be flexibly acquired when learning a specific task. To investigate this, we built a generative model of V1 optimized for a simple discrimination task and analyzed it together with large-scale recordings from mice performing an analogous task. In line with recent approaches, we assumed that neuronal activity in V1 corresponds to latent posteriors in the generative model, enabling investigation of task-related priors in neuronal responses. To obtain a flexible test bed, we extended the VAE formalism so that a task can be acquired efficiently by reusing previously learned representations. Task-specific priors learned by this Task-Amortized VAE were used to investigate biases in mice and model when presenting stimuli that violated trained task statistics. Mismatch between learned task statistics and incoming sensory evidence produced signatures of uncertainty in stimulus category in the TAVAE posterior, reflecting properties of bimodal response profiles in V1 recordings. The task-optimized generative model accounted for key characteristics of V1 population activity, including within-day updates to population responses. Our results confirm that flexible task-specific contextual priors can be learned on demand by the visual system and deployed as early as the entry level of visual cortex.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulation-based inference methods struggle with handling outliers and extreme values in data, impacting inference accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Method: The approach combines generalized Bayesian inference with a neural approximation of a weighted score-matching loss. A conditional density model is adopted to simplify inference and eliminate Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.

Result: The proposed method achieves robustness to outliers while being amortized, simplifying inference processes, and significantly reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: This novel methodology provides a promising simulation-based inference framework that robustly addresses outliers and enhances computational efficiency in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Complex simulator-based models are now routinely used to perform inference across the sciences and engineering, but existing inference methods are often unable to account for outliers and other extreme values in data which occur due to faulty measurement instruments or human error. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to simulation-based inference grounded in generalised Bayesian inference and a neural approximation of a weighted score-matching loss. This leads to a method that is both amortised and provably robust to outliers, a combination not achieved by existing approaches. Furthermore, through a carefully chosen conditional density model, we demonstrate that inference can be further simplified and performed without the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, thereby offering significant computational advantages, with complexity that is only a small fraction of that of current state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: The paper addresses an online learning problem with multiple change points, introducing a novel algorithm named Anytime Tracking CUSUM (ATC) to tackle challenges like endogenous confounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to effectively handle online learning problems in environments with multiple change points, where classical high-confidence detection methods fail due to endogenous confounding.

Method: The proposed Anytime Tracking CUSUM (ATC) algorithm applies a selective detection principle to balance ignoring small, hard-to-detect shifts while reacting quickly to significant ones. It is horizon-free and designed to be nearly minimax-optimal.

Result: The ATC algorithm achieves nearly minimax-optimal regret performance and is validated theoretically and experimentally on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The ATC algorithm is effective for online learning in multiple change point scenarios, overcoming limitations of traditional methods while closely aligning with theoretical performance bounds.

Abstract: We consider an online learning problem in environments with multiple change points. In contrast to the single change point problem that is widely studied using classical "high confidence" detection schemes, the multiple change point environment presents new learning-theoretic and algorithmic challenges. Specifically, we show that classical methods may exhibit catastrophic failure (high regret) due to a phenomenon we refer to as endogenous confounding. To overcome this, we propose a new class of learning algorithms dubbed Anytime Tracking CUSUM (ATC). These are horizon-free online algorithms that implement a selective detection principle, balancing the need to ignore "small" (hard-to-detect) shifts, while reacting "quickly" to significant ones. We prove that the performance of a properly tuned ATC algorithm is nearly minimax-optimal; its regret is guaranteed to closely match a novel information-theoretic lower bound on the achievable performance of any learning algorithm in the multiple change point problem. Experiments on synthetic as well as real-world data validate the aforementioned theoretical findings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CycleFQI, a novel framework for cyclic MDP problems with heterogeneous dynamics, decomposing them into stage-specific sub-problems for improved offline learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline learning in cyclic MDPs is challenging due to state distribution mismatches across stages caused by policy optimization at any step.

Method: They propose a modular cyclic MDP framework with stage-specific sub-problems and present CycleFQI, which uses a tailored Q-function vector for stage-wise sequences, supporting partial control and offering theoretical guarantees.

Result: They establish error bounds, global convergence rates, and demonstrate performance improvements on Type 1 Diabetes datasets compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: CycleFQI addresses challenges of cyclic MDPs, improves policy optimization while mitigating dimensionality issues, and achieves significant real-world validation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel cyclic Markov decision process (MDP) framework for multi-step decision problems with heterogeneous stage-specific dynamics, transitions, and discount factors across the cycle. In this setting, offline learning is challenging: optimizing a policy at any stage shifts the state distributions of subsequent stages, propagating mismatch across the cycle. To address this, we propose a modular structural framework that decomposes the cyclic process into stage-wise sub-problems. While generally applicable, we instantiate this principle as CycleFQI, an extension of fitted Q-iteration enabling theoretical analysis and interpretation. It uses a vector of stage-specific Q-functions, tailored to each stage, to capture within-stage sequences and transitions between stages. This modular design enables partial control, allowing some stages to be optimized while others follow predefined policies. We establish finite-sample suboptimality error bounds and derive global convergence rates under Besov regularity, demonstrating that CycleFQI mitigates the curse of dimensionality compared to monolithic baselines. Additionally, we propose a sieve-based method for asymptotic inference of optimal policy values under a margin condition. Experiments on simulated and real-world Type 1 Diabetes data sets demonstrate CycleFQI's effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve the estimation of observation parameters in inverse problems, ensuring computational efficiency and optimality in a challenging Bayesian framework.

Method: The method involves using regularization through a Bayesian framework with the prior modeled as a diffusion process. MCMC algorithms are employed to compute estimates and posterior properties efficiently.

Result: The paper demonstrates computational efficiency and high-quality estimation, along with accurate uncertainty quantification, supported by thorough numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for inverse problem resolution by enabling optimal observation parameter estimation and uncertainty measurements, backed by validations through experiments.

Abstract: This article addresses the issue of estimating observation parameters (response and error parameters) in inverse problems. The focus is on cases where regularization is introduced in a Bayesian framework and the prior is modeled by a diffusion process. In this context, the issue of posterior sampling is well known to be thorny, and a recent paper proposes a notably simple and effective solution. Consequently, it offers an remarkable additional flexibility when it comes to estimating observation parameters. The proposed strategy enables us to define an optimal estimator for both the observation parameters and the image of interest. Furthermore, the strategy provides a means of quantifying uncertainty. In addition, MCMC algorithms allow for the efficient computation of estimates and properties of posteriors, while offering some guarantees. The paper presents several numerical experiments that clearly confirm the computational efficiency and the quality of both estimates and uncertainties quantification.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates the utility and tightness of the fairness bounds across three classical fairness measures.

Conclusion: The framework effectively provides fairness guarantees while optimizing generalization bounds for predictive risk and fairness.

Abstract: Classical PAC generalization bounds on the prediction risk of a classifier are insufficient to provide theoretical guarantees on fairness when the goal is to learn models balancing predictive risk and fairness constraints. We propose a PAC-Bayesian framework for deriving generalization bounds for fairness, covering both stochastic and deterministic classifiers. For stochastic classifiers, we derive a fairness bound using standard PAC-Bayes techniques. Whereas for deterministic classifiers, as usual PAC-Bayes arguments do not apply directly, we leverage a recent advance in PAC-Bayes to extend the fairness bound beyond the stochastic setting. Our framework has two advantages: (i) It applies to a broad class of fairness measures that can be expressed as a risk discrepancy, and (ii) it leads to a self-bounding algorithm in which the learning procedure directly optimizes a trade-off between generalization bounds on the prediction risk and on the fairness. We empirically evaluate our framework with three classical fairness measures, demonstrating not only its usefulness but also the tightness of our bounds.

### [454] [Aggregate Models, Not Explanations: Improving Feature Importance Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11760)
*Joseph Paillard,Angel Reyero Lobo,Denis A. Engemann,Bertrand Thirion*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores the instability of variable-importance measures in machine learning and compares methods to improve their accuracy for biomedical applications, emphasizing the benefit of model-level ensembling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the instability and inaccuracy of variable-importance estimates caused by data sampling and algorithmic stochasticity, which are critical in biomedical applications relying on machine learning models.

Method: The researchers conduct theoretical analysis under assumptions that account for modern, expressive ML models, and compare the benefits of model-level ensembling versus aggregating individual model explanations. The methods are validated on benchmarks and a large-scale biomedical study.

Result: The theoretical findings demonstrate that model-level ensembling reduces excess risk and provides more accurate variable-importance estimates, especially for expressive models.

Conclusion: Ensembling at the model level enhances the reliability of variable-importance estimates for complex models, benefiting applications in areas like biomedical research.

Abstract: Feature-importance methods show promise in transforming machine learning models from predictive engines into tools for scientific discovery. However, due to data sampling and algorithmic stochasticity, expressive models can be unstable, leading to inaccurate variable importance estimates and undermining their utility in critical biomedical applications. Although ensembling offers a solution, deciding whether to explain a single ensemble model or aggregate individual model explanations is difficult due to the nonlinearity of importance measures and remains largely understudied. Our theoretical analysis, developed under assumptions accommodating complex state-of-the-art ML models, reveals that this choice is primarily driven by the model's excess risk. In contrast to prior literature, we show that ensembling at the model level provides more accurate variable-importance estimates, particularly for expressive models, by reducing this leading error term. We validate these findings on classical benchmarks and a large-scale proteomic study from the UK Biobank.

### [455] [The Implicit Bias of Logit Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12039)
*Alon Beck,Yohai Bar Sinai,Noam Levi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the effects of logit regularization methods, including label smoothing, demonstrating their role in inducing clustering in logit space and aligning models with Fisher’s Linear Discriminant, ultimately improving generalization and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the underlying mechanism of logit regularization methods, widely used in modern classifiers, to understand their influence on improving calibration and generalization, which is currently under-researched.

Method: The authors analyze a general class of logit regularizers, specifically in linear classifications, and prove their properties and implications using theoretical frameworks like Fisher’s Linear Discriminant. They study a signal-plus-noise model to showcase practical consequences.

Result: The study shows that logit regularization causes logit clustering, aligns the model with Fisher's Linear Discriminant, reduces the critical sample complexity by half, induces grokking in low noise, and makes generalization robust to noise.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical insights into logit regularization, extending the understanding of methods like label smoothing, and highlights the benefits of such methods in enhancing classifier efficacy, especially in generalization and noise robustness.

Abstract: Logit regularization, the addition a convex penalty directly in logit space, is widely used in modern classifiers, with label smoothing as a prominent example. While such methods often improve calibration and generalization, their mechanism remains under-explored. In this work, we analyze a general class of such logit regularizers in the context of linear classification, and demonstrate that they induce an implicit bias of logit clustering around finite per-sample targets. For Gaussian data, or whenever logits are sufficiently clustered, we prove that logit clustering drives the weight vector to align exactly with Fisher's Linear Discriminant. To demonstrate the consequences, we study a simple signal-plus-noise model in which this transition has dramatic effects: Logit regularization halves the critical sample complexity and induces grokking in the small-noise limit, while making generalization robust to noise. Our results extend the theoretical understanding of label smoothing and highlight the efficacy of a broader class of logit-regularization methods.

TL;DR: The paper investigates inequalities in language AI, revealing that most languages face digital marginalization and introducing a readiness index to promote equitable technology access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inequality in language AI, where most of the world's linguistic communities lack access to AI tools and technology in their native languages.

Method: The authors performed a global longitudinal analysis to study the availability of AI resources for 6003 languages and introduced the Language AI Readiness Index (EQUATE) to assess socio-economic and infrastructural readiness for deploying AI technologies.

Result: The findings show that language AI resources are concentrated in a few dominant languages, and disparities are growing exponentially. The Language AI Readiness Index identifies areas with potential for AI deployment but underutilization.

Conclusion: The study establishes a baseline for promoting sustainable and equitable advancements in language AI technology and provides a framework to prioritize equitable diffusion of AI across linguistic communities.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, education, governance and socioeconomic equity, but its benefits remain concentrated in a small number of languages (Bender, 2019; Blasi et al., 2022; Joshi et al., 2020; Ranathunga and de Silva, 2022; Young, 2015). Language AI - the technologies that underpin widely-used conversational systems such as ChatGPT - could provide major benefits if available in people's native languages, yet most of the world's 7,000+ linguistic communities currently lack access and face persistent digital marginalization. Here we present a global longitudinal analysis of social, economic and infrastructural conditions across languages to assess systemic inequalities in language AI. We first analyze the existence of AI resources for 6003 languages. We find that despite efforts of the community to broaden the reach of language technologies (Bapna et al., 2022; Costa-Jussà et al., 2022), the dominance of a handful of languages is exacerbating disparities on an unprecedented scale, with divides widening exponentially rather than narrowing. Further, we contrast the longitudinal diffusion of AI with that of earlier IT technologies, revealing a distinctive hype-driven pattern of spread. To translate our findings into practical insights and guide prioritization efforts, we introduce the Language AI Readiness Index (EQUATE), which maps the state of technological, socio-economic, and infrastructural prerequisites for AI deployment across languages. The index highlights communities where capacity exists but remains underutilized, and provides a framework for accelerating more equitable diffusion of language AI. Our work contributes to setting the baseline for a transition towards more sustainable and equitable language technologies.

### [457] [The Manifold of the Absolute: Religious Perennialism as Generative Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11368)
*Arthur Juliani*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper models religious traditions using Variational Autoencoders, analyzing how different approaches (exclusivism, universalism, perennialism, and syncretism) explain cross-traditional convergence. It concludes that perennialism best accounts for interreligious unity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand and formalize the epistemological relationships among religious traditions, particularly how they converge or differ in contemplative practices and cultural forms.

Method: The authors apply the mathematical framework of Variational Autoencoders to model religious traditions as generative mappings from a latent space to observable cultural expressions and compare the viability of exclusivism, universalism, perennialism, and syncretism.

Result: They find that exclusivism and syncretism fail to account for cross-religious contemplative convergence, universalism suffers from oversimplification, and perennialism provides the best explanatory fit for preserving interreligious relationships and structural coherence.

Conclusion: The study concludes that religious unity cannot be achieved through shortcuts like syncretism or universalism. Instead, deep engagement with specific religious traditions using their contemplative practices is essential to recover latent spiritual truths.

Abstract: This paper formalizes religious epistemology through the mathematics of Variational Autoencoders. We model religious traditions as distinct generative mappings from a shared, low-dimensional latent space to the high-dimensional space of observable cultural forms, and define three competing generative configurations corresponding to exclusivism, universalism, and perennialism, alongside syncretism as direct mixing in observable space. Through abductive comparison, we argue that exclusivism cannot parsimoniously account for cross-traditional contemplative convergence, that syncretism fails because combining the outputs of distinct generative processes produces incoherent artifacts, and that universalism suffers from posterior collapse: stripping traditions to a common core discards the structural information necessary for inference. The perennialist configuration provides the best explanatory fit. Within this framework, strict orthodoxy emerges not as a cultural constraint but as a structural necessity: the contemplative practices that recover the latent source must be matched to the specific tradition whose forms they take as input. The unity of religions, if it exists, is real but inaccessible by shortcut: one must go deep rather than wide.

### [458] [When Visibility Outpaces Verification: Delayed Verification and Narrative Lock-in in Agentic AI Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11412)
*Hanjing Shi,Dominic DiFranzo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper examines how social proof and timing of verification influence discussions about agentic AI on Reddit, finding that high-visibility discussions often lack timely verification, fostering unverified narrative biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how platform-driven signals (e.g., upvotes) influence the credibility and evaluation biases in online discussions, particularly concerning agentic AI systems.

Method: Analyzed longitudinal data from two Reddit communities using reproducible lexical verification rules and right-censored survival analysis to study the timing of verification cues.

Result: High-visibility discussions had delayed or absent verification cues, leading to a "Popularity Paradox," locking unverified narratives into collective biases.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for "epistemic friction" as a design intervention to counter the credibility-by-visibility issue and improve critical evaluation in platforms dealing with AI discussions.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems-autonomous entities capable of independent planning and execution-reshape the landscape of human-AI trust. Long before direct system exposure, user expectations are mediated through high-stakes public discourse on social platforms. However, platform-mediated engagement signals (e.g., upvotes) may inadvertently function as a ``credibility proxy,'' potentially stifling critical evaluation.
  This paper investigates the interplay between social proof and verification timing in online discussions of agentic AI. Analyzing a longitudinal dataset from two distinct Reddit communities with contrasting interaction cultures-r/OpenClaw and r/Moltbook-we operationalize verification cues via reproducible lexical rules and model the ``time-to-first-verification'' using a right-censored survival analysis framework.
  Our findings reveal a systemic ``Popularity Paradox'': high-visibility discussions in both subreddits experience significantly delayed or entirely absent verification cues compared to low-visibility threads. This temporal lag creates a critical window for ``Narrative Lock-in,'' where early, unverified claims crystallize into collective cognitive biases before evidence-seeking behaviors emerge. We discuss the implications of this ``credibility-by-visibility'' effect for AI safety and propose ``epistemic friction'' as a design intervention to rebalance engagement-driven platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured method for understanding and manipulating the evolution of distributed systems modeled by Petri nets.

Method: Demonstrates that the set of runs of a composite Petri net is equivalent to the composition of the runs of individual nets.

Result: Proves the equivalence of net composition and run composition for Petri nets.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified approach to compose and decompose Petri nets while preserving their run behavior.

Abstract: In the late 1970s, C.A. Petri introduced partially ordered event occurrences (runs), then called \emph{processes}, as the appropriate model to describe the individual evolutions of distributed systems. Here, we present a unified framework for handling Petri nets and their runs, specifically to compose and decompose them. It is shown that, for nets $M$ and $N$, the set of runs of the composed net $M \bullet N$ equals the composition of the runs of $M$ and $N$.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The study introduces 'interwhen,' a test-time verification framework ensuring the output validity of reasoning models using meta-prompting for both self and external verification, achieving efficiency and accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish verified reasoning in high-stakes applications (law, finance, physical agents), overcoming the inefficiencies and restrictions of existing verification methods.

Method: Developed a framework called interwhen that employs meta-prompting to prompt reasoning models to follow a verifiable format, enabling efficient and sound verification using self or external validation.

Result: Interwhen achieved state-of-the-art results for early stopping without accuracy loss in self-verification and a 10 percentage point improvement in accuracy with 100% soundness in external verification while being four times more efficient.

Conclusion: Interwhen effectively improves the efficiency, accuracy, and soundness of reasoning model verifications, demonstrating its utility in critical applications. Its codebase is publicly available.

Abstract: We present a test-time verification framework, interwhen, that ensures that the output of a reasoning model is valid wrt. a given set of verifiers. Verified reasoning is an important goal in high-stakes scenarios such as deploying agents in the physical world or in domains such as law and finance. However, current techniques either rely on the generate-test paradigm that verifies only after the final answer is produced, or verify partial output through a step-extraction paradigm where the task execution is externally broken down into structured steps. The former is inefficient while the latter artificially restricts a model's problem solving strategies. Instead, we propose to verify a model's reasoning trace as-is, taking full advantage of a model's reasoning capabilities while verifying and steering the model's output only when needed. The key idea is meta-prompting, identifying the verifiable properties that any partial solution should satisfy and then prompting the model to follow a custom format in its trace such that partial outputs can be easily parsed and checked. We consider both self-verification and external verification and find that interwhen provides a useful abstraction to provide feedback and steer reasoning models in each case. Using self-verification, interwhen obtains state-of-the-art results on early stopping reasoning models, without any loss in accuracy. Using external verifiers, interwhen obtains 10 p.p. improvement in accuracy over test-time scaling methods, while ensuring 100% soundness and being 4x more efficient. The code for interwhen is available at https://github.com/microsoft/interwhen

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new criterion for copyright infringement related to generative AI's outputs: focusing on whether the AI's training relied on specific copyrighted works.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the insufficiency of current copyright infringement definitions in handling generative AI outputs that imitate style without directly copying content.

Method: The paper models generative systems as closure operators mapping existing works to new outputs, defining permissible outputs under their proposed criterion of infringement.

Result: The authors analyze structural properties of permissible AI generation and identify that the impact of regulation depends on the nature (light-tailed or heavy-tailed) of organic creation processes.

Conclusion: Under certain conditions, AI generation may be unrestricted by regulation, but in heavy-tailed creative processes, regulations could impose persistent limitations.

Abstract: Copyright law focuses on whether a new work is "substantially similar" to an existing one, but generative AI can closely imitate style without copying content, a capability now central to ongoing litigation. We argue that existing definitions of infringement are ill-suited to this setting and propose a new criterion: a generative AI output infringes on an existing work if it could not have been generated without that work in its training corpus. To operationalize this definition, we model generative systems as closure operators mapping a corpus of existing works to an output of new works. AI generated outputs are \emph{permissible} if they do not infringe on any existing work according to our criterion. Our results characterize structural properties of permissible generation and reveal a sharp asymptotic dichotomy: when the process of organic creations is light-tailed, dependence on individual works eventually vanishes, so that regulation imposes no limits on AI generation; with heavy-tailed creations, regulation can be persistently constraining.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes MAP and LMMSE approaches for blind deconvolution problems and concludes that LMMSE provides robust results and aids MAP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instability in MAP methods for blind deconvolution problems caused by non-convexity and solution non-identifiability.

Method: Synthetic experiments were conducted on 2D blind deconvolution problems using tailored MAP algorithms and LMMSE estimators under controlled distributions.

Result: MAP methods exhibited instability and need extensive tuning, whereas LMMSE estimators provided robust baselines and improved MAP initialization.

Conclusion: LMMSE is a reliable method that can be used to enhance the performance and stability of MAP approaches in blind deconvolution.

Abstract: Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) approaches are an effective framework for inverse problems with known forward operators, particularly when combined with expressive priors and careful parameter selection. In blind settings, however, their use becomes significantly less stable due to the inherent non-convexity of the problem and the potential non-identifiability of the solutions. (Linear) minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators provide a compelling alternative that can circumvent these limitations. In this work, we study synthetic two-dimensional blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions, with complete prior knowledge of both the signal and kernel distributions. We compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators whose functional form is closely related to that of an optimal Tikhonov estimator. Our results show that, even in these highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning, whereas the LMMSE estimator yields a robust and reliable baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that the LMMSE solution can serve as an effective initialization for MAP approaches, improving their performance and reducing sensitivity to regularization parameters, thereby opening the door to future theoretical and practical developments.

Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of traditional expert algorithms for optimizing phase shifts in RIS-aided cell-free mMIMO systems while maintaining high spectral efficiency under practical constraints like imperfect CSI and spatial correlation.

Method: Two generative AI models, GCDM and GCDIM, were proposed, leveraging diffusion models conditioned on dynamic CSI to maximize system sum spectral efficiency.

Result: Simulation results show that GCDM achieves comparable spectral efficiency to expert algorithms with reduced computation. GCDIM achieves a similar result with a 98% reduction in computation time.

Conclusion: The proposed GenAI models demonstrate the potential to optimize efficient and high-performance systems, making RIS-aided mMIMO systems more computationally feasible.

Abstract: This work investigates a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) model to optimize the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phase shifts in RIS-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems under practical constraints, including imperfect channel state information (CSI) and spatial correlation. We propose two GenAI based approaches, generative conditional diffusion model (GCDM) and generative conditional diffusion implicit model (GCDIM), leveraging the diffusion model conditioned on dynamic CSI to maximize the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. To benchmark performance, we compare the proposed GenAI based approaches against an expert algorithm, traditionally known for achieving near-optimal solutions at the cost of computational efficiency. The simulation results demonstrate that GCDM matches the sum SE achieved by the expert algorithm while significantly reducing the computational overhead. Furthermore, GCDIM achieves a comparable sum SE with an additional $98\%$ reduction in computation time, underscoring its potential for efficient phase optimization in RIS-aided cell-free mMIMO systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of offline multiple change-point detection by developing a more accurate and efficient approach.

Method: The authors designed strengthened MIP formulations for piecewise linear fitting, focusing on tighter linear programming relaxations. They extended this to handle multidimensional models with shared change-points and sparse change-point detection.

Result: Performance improvements are observed in computational experiments with real-world datasets, showing faster solution times for both $_1$ and $_2$ loss functions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed formulations offer a more effective and computationally efficient solution for offline multiple change-point detection, even in complex scenarios.

Abstract: We present a new mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach for offline multiple change-point detection by casting the problem as a globally optimal piecewise linear (PWL) fitting problem. Our main contribution is a family of strengthened MIP formulations whose linear programming (LP) relaxations admit integral projections onto the segment assignment variables, which encode the segment membership of each data point. This property yields provably tighter relaxations than existing formulations for offline multiple change-point detection. We further extend the framework to two settings of active research interest: (i) multidimensional PWL models with shared change-points, and (ii) sparse change-point detection, where only a subset of dimensions undergo structural change. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed formulations achieve reductions in solution times under both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ loss functions in comparison to the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: The paper aims to address unclear impacts of node-specific variance in stochastic gradients on algorithm design and complexity in decentralized optimization for distributed machine learning.

Method: The authors propose D-NSS with node-specific sampling and arithmetic mean variance dependency. They also introduce a variance reduction framework called D-NSS-VR.

Result: D-NSS achieves optimal sample complexity bounds relying on the arithmetic mean of local variances. The framework validates these findings and extends them with D-NSS-VR for further improvements.

Conclusion: The methods provide a theoretically optimal approach to decentralized learning under heterogeneous variance, yielding validated and effective practical algorithms.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization is critical for solving large-scale machine learning problems over distributed networks, where multiple nodes collaborate through local communication. In practice, the variances of stochastic gradient estimators often differ across nodes, yet their impact on algorithm design and complexity remains unclear. To address this issue, we propose D-NSS, a decentralized algorithm with node-specific sampling, and establish its sample complexity depending on the arithmetic mean of local standard deviations, achieving tighter bounds than existing methods that rely on the worst-case or quadratic mean. We further derive a matching sample complexity lower bound under heterogeneous variance, thereby proving the optimality of this dependence. Moreover, we extend the framework with a variance reduction technique and develop D-NSS-VR, which under the mean-squared smoothness assumption attains an improved sample complexity bound while preserving the arithmetic-mean dependence. Finally, numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper challenges existing theories of Muon optimizers by showing how their approximations impact trajectory and finite-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the empirical success of the Muon optimizer and address gaps in existing theoretical explanations.

Method: Analyzing Muon dynamics on continuous and discrete-time scales using simple convex functions like squared Frobenius norm.

Result: Reveals how inexactness in approximations benefits performance and highlights the role of objective structure on constants.

Conclusion: Current theories are inadequate; better models must integrate effects of approximations and structural objective properties or justify ignoring them.

Abstract: Muon updates weight matrices along (approximate) polar factors of the gradients and has shown strong empirical performance in large-scale training. Existing attempts at explaining its performance largely focus on single-step comparisons (on quadratic proxies) and worst-case guarantees that treat the inexactness of the polar-factor as a nuisance ``to be argued away''. We show that already on simple strongly convex functions such as $L(W)=\frac12\|W\|_{\text{F}}^2$, these perspectives are insufficient, suggesting that understanding Muon requires going beyond local proxies and pessimistic worst-case bounds. Instead, our analysis exposes two observations that already affect behavior on simple quadratics and are not well captured by prevailing abstractions: (i) approximation error in the polar step can qualitatively alter discrete-time dynamics and improve reachability and finite-time performance -- an effect practitioners exploit to tune Muon, but that existing theory largely treats as a pure accuracy compromise; and (ii) structural properties of the objective affect finite-budget constants beyond the prevailing conditioning-based explanations. Thus, any general theory covering these cases must either incorporate these ingredients explicitly or explain why they are irrelevant in the regimes of interest.

Motivation: To address the challenge of solving nonsmooth optimal control problems for linear PDEs efficiently and in real-time.

Result: The iUzawa-Net demonstrated efficient performance on nonsmooth elliptic and parabolic optimal control problems, supported by universal approximation and $$-optimality properties.

Conclusion: iUzawa-Net provides a robust framework synergizing optimization algorithms and deep learning, with wide applications in PDE-constrained optimization problems.

Abstract: We propose an optimization-informed deep neural network approach, named iUzawa-Net, aiming for the first solver that enables real-time solutions for a class of nonsmooth optimal control problems of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The iUzawa-Net unrolls an inexact Uzawa method for saddle point problems, replacing classical preconditioners and PDE solvers with specifically designed learnable neural networks. We prove universal approximation properties and establish the asymptotic $\varepsilon$-optimality for the iUzawa-Net, and validate its promising numerical efficiency through nonsmooth elliptic and parabolic optimal control problems. Our techniques offer a versatile framework for designing and analyzing various optimization-informed deep learning approaches to optimal control and other PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed learning-to-control approach synergizes model-based optimization algorithms and data-driven deep learning techniques, inheriting the merits of both methodologies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces learning dynamics in games that converge quickly while being scale-free and scale-invariant, eliminating the need for prior utilization scale knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fast convergence in games often depends on prior knowledge of utility scales. Therefore, there is a need for scale-free and scale-invariant methods.

Method: The study designs learning dynamics using optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with adaptive learning rates and employs techniques like doubling clipping and stopping-time analysis for improved performance.

Result: In two-player zero-sum games, dynamics achieve an $\tilde{O}(A_{\mathrm{diff}}/T)$ Nash equilibrium convergence rate, while in multiplayer general-sum games they achieve an $O(U_{\mathrm{max}} \log T/T)$ convergence rate to correlated equilibrium.

Conclusion: The proposed learning dynamics provide rapid and robust performance in games without requiring scale-dependent tuning or prior utility knowledge.

Abstract: Scale-invariance in games has recently emerged as a widely valued desirable property. Yet, almost all fast convergence guarantees in learning in games require prior knowledge of the utility scale. To address this, we develop learning dynamics that achieve fast convergence while being both scale-free, requiring no prior information about utilities, and scale-invariant, remaining unchanged under positive rescaling of utilities. For two-player zero-sum games, we obtain scale-free and scale-invariant dynamics with external regret bounded by $\tilde{O}(A_{\mathrm{diff}})$, where $A_{\mathrm{diff}}$ is the payoff range, which implies an $\tilde{O}(A_{\mathrm{diff}} / T)$ convergence rate to Nash equilibrium after $T$ rounds. For multiplayer general-sum games with $n$ players and $m$ actions, we obtain scale-free and scale-invariant dynamics with swap regret bounded by $O(U_{\mathrm{max}} \log T)$, where $U_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the range of the utilities, ignoring the dependence on the number of players and actions. This yields an $O(U_{\mathrm{max}} \log T / T)$ convergence rate to correlated equilibrium. Our learning dynamics are based on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with an adaptive learning rate that incorporates the squared path length of the opponents' gradient vectors, together with a new stopping-time analysis that exploits negative terms in regret bounds without scale-dependent tuning. For general-sum games, scale-free learning is enabled also by a technique called doubling clipping, which clips observed gradients based on past observations.

Method: An online behavioral experiment with 243 participants engaging in three bargaining games where each game features a different AI modality (Advisor, Coach, Delegate). AI modalities utilize a high-performing LLM.

Result: Participants preferred the Advisor modality but achieved the highest individual gains with the Delegate. The Delegate modality also benefited non-adopting members via higher-quality offers, acting as a market maker.

Conclusion: Although autonomous agents can optimize outcomes strategically, their effectiveness in improving human welfare depends on user-friendly interfaces and mechanisms that encourage adoption.

Abstract: As AI usage becomes more prevalent in social contexts, understanding agent-user interaction is critical to designing systems that improve both individual and group outcomes. We present an online behavioral experiment (N = 243) in which participants play three multi-turn bargaining games in groups of three. Each game, presented in randomized order, grants \textit{access to} a single LLM assistance modality: proactive recommendations from an \textit{Advisor}, reactive feedback from a \textit{Coach}, or autonomous execution by a \textit{Delegate}; all modalities are powered by an underlying LLM that achieves superhuman performance in an all-agent environment. On each turn, participants privately decide whether to act manually or use the AI modality available in that game. Despite preferring the \textit{Advisor} modality, participants achieve the highest mean individual gains with the \textit{Delegate}, demonstrating a preference-performance misalignment. Moreover, delegation generates positive externalities; even non-adopting users in \textit{access-to-delegate} treatment groups benefit by receiving higher-quality offers. Mechanism analysis reveals that the \textit{Delegate} agent acts as a market maker, injecting rational, Pareto-improving proposals that restructure the trading environment. Our research reveals a gap between agent capabilities and realized group welfare. While autonomous agents can exhibit super-human strategic performance, their impact on realized welfare gains can be constrained by interfaces, user perceptions, and adoption barriers. Assistance modalities should be designed as mechanisms with endogenous participation; adoption-compatible interaction rules are a prerequisite to improving human welfare with automated assistance.

### [470] [Convex Markov Games and Beyond: New Proof of Existence, Characterization and Learning Algorithms for Nash Equilibria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12181)
*Anas Barakat,Ioannis Panageas,Antonios Varvitsiotis*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper studies General Utility Markov Games (GUMGs) as an extension of Convex Markov Games (cMGs), providing a deeper theoretical understanding of Nash equilibria and related learning approaches. Key theoretical results and algorithms are introduced for solving GUMGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address gaps in understanding the structure of Nash equilibria and learning guarantees in cMGs and extend the framework to more general settings termed as GUMGs, which involve agent coupling beyond additive rewards.

Method: The authors analyze Nash equilibria in GUMGs using projected pseudo-gradient dynamics and propose a novel agent-wise gradient domination property. They leverage this to establish policy gradient algorithms alongside theoretical guarantees for iteration complexity and sample complexity.

Result: This study confirms the existence of Nash equilibria, including Markov perfect equilibria, in GUMGs and develops methods for finding these equilibria. It also provides theoretical bounds for potential GUMGs while extending analysis beyond zero-sum games to include common-interest cMGs.

Conclusion: The findings provide a broader theoretical foundation for GUMGs, enabling deeper understanding and practical algorithm design for multi-agent learning scenarios with general utilities.

Abstract: Convex Markov Games (cMGs) were recently introduced as a broad class of multi-agent learning problems that generalize Markov games to settings where strategic agents optimize general utilities beyond additive rewards. While cMGs expand the modeling frontier, their theoretical foundations, particularly the structure of Nash equilibria (NE) and guarantees for learning algorithms, are not yet well understood. In this work, we address these gaps for an extension of cMGs, which we term General Utility Markov Games (GUMGs), capturing new applications requiring coupling between agents' occupancy measures. We prove that in GUMGs, Nash equilibria coincide with the fixed points of projected pseudo-gradient dynamics (i.e., first-order stationary points), enabled by a novel agent-wise gradient domination property. This insight also yields a simple proof of NE existence using Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. We further show the existence of Markov perfect equilibria. Building on this characterization, we establish a policy gradient theorem for GUMGs and design a model-free policy gradient algorithm. For potential GUMGs, we establish iteration complexity guarantees for computing approximate-NE under exact gradients and provide sample complexity bounds in both the generative model and on-policy settings. Our results extend beyond prior work restricted to zero-sum cMGs, providing the first theoretical analysis of common-interest cMGs.

### [471] [Is Online Linear Optimization Sufficient for Strategic Robustness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12253)
*Yang Cai,Haipeng Luo,Chen-Yu Wei,Weiqiang Zheng*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores bidding strategies in repeated Bayesian first-price auctions using online linear optimization (OLO) algorithms to achieve sublinear regret and strategic robustness, presenting improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve bidding algorithms in repeated Bayesian first-price auctions, addressing the tradeoff between regret minimization and robustness to seller manipulation, which has received relatively little attention.

Method: The authors develop black-box reductions to convert online linear optimization (OLO) algorithms into robust no-regret bidding algorithms, both under known and unknown value distribution settings.

Result: Their approach achieves $O(\sqrt{T \log K})$ regret for known value distributions, drastically reducing the dependency on $K$, and $O(\sqrt{T (\log K+\log(T/δ))})$ regret for unknown distributions without requiring a bounded density assumption.

Conclusion: Simple OLO algorithms are sufficient to design bidding algorithms that balance sublinear regret and strategic robustness, overcoming limitations of prior methods with improved efficiency and flexibility.

Abstract: We consider bidding in repeated Bayesian first-price auctions. Bidding algorithms that achieve optimal regret have been extensively studied, but their strategic robustness to the seller's manipulation remains relatively underexplored. Bidding algorithms based on no-swap-regret algorithms achieve both desirable properties, but are suboptimal in terms of statistical and computational efficiency. In contrast, online gradient ascent is the only algorithm that achieves $O(\sqrt{TK})$ regret and strategic robustness [KSS24], where $T$ denotes the number of auctions and $K$ the number of bids.
  In this paper, we explore whether simple online linear optimization (OLO) algorithms suffice for bidding algorithms with both desirable properties. Our main result shows that sublinear linearized regret is sufficient for strategic robustness. Specifically, we construct simple black-box reductions that convert any OLO algorithm into a strategically robust no-regret bidding algorithm, in both known and unknown value distribution settings. For the known value distribution case, our reduction yields a bidding algorithm that achieves $O(\sqrt{T \log K})$ regret and strategic robustness (with exponential improvement on the $K$-dependence compared to [KSS24]). For the unknown value distribution case, our reduction gives a bidding algorithm with high-probability $O(\sqrt{T (\log K+\log(T/δ)})$ regret and strategic robustness, while removing the bounded density assumption made in [KSS24].

### [472] [Bandit Learning in Matching Markets with Interviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12224)
*Amirmahdi Mirfakhar,Xuchuang Wang,Mengfan Xu,Hedyeh Beyhaghi,Mohammad Hajiesmaili*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores two-sided matching markets with interview-based partial information, introducing a model where both firms and agents have uncertain preferences. It proposes novel algorithms to reduce matching errors, achieving time-independent regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of limited preference information during matching processes, considering real-world impracticalities and early noisy impressions that impact decisions.

Method: It introduces a new framework allowing strategic deferral by firms to recover from hiring mistakes and proposes novel algorithms for centralized and decentralized matching settings.

Result: The designed algorithms achieve time-independent regret and perform well under decentralized settings, closing performance gaps with centralized approaches in structured markets.

Conclusion: The study presents a robust framework and algorithms to handle uncertainty in preference data, enhancing decision-making in matching markets with minimal regret.

Abstract: Two-sided matching markets rely on preferences from both sides, yet it is often impractical to evaluate preferences. Participants, therefore, conduct a limited number of interviews, which provide early, noisy impressions and shape final decisions. We study bandit learning in matching markets with interviews, modeling interviews as \textit{low-cost hints} that reveal partial preference information to both sides. Our framework departs from existing work by allowing firm-side uncertainty: firms, like agents, may be unsure of their own preferences and can make early hiring mistakes by hiring less preferred agents. To handle this, we extend the firm's action space to allow \emph{strategic deferral} (choosing not to hire in a round), enabling recovery from suboptimal hires and supporting decentralized learning without coordination. We design novel algorithms for (i) a centralized setting with an omniscient interview allocator and (ii) decentralized settings with two types of firm-side feedback. Across all settings, our algorithms achieve time-independent regret, a substantial improvement over the $O(\log T)$ regret bounds known for learning stable matchings without interviews. Also, under mild structured markets, decentralized performance matches the centralized counterpart up to polynomial factors in the number of agents and firms.

### [473] [Enforcing Reciprocity in Operator Learning for Seismic Wave Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11631)
*Caifeng Zou,Yaozhong Shi,Zachary E. Ross,Robert W. Clayton,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes RENO, a transformer-based model for seismic wave propagation, embedding the physical principle of reciprocity for improved consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional seismic modeling methods are accurate but computationally demanding, while data-driven methods lack strict physical consistency. There is a need to merge the benefits of both approaches.

Method: The authors designed the Reciprocity-Enforced Neural Operator (RENO), leveraging cross-attention mechanisms and commutative operations to encode the reciprocity principle in a transformer-based architecture.

Result: RENO achieves invariance under swapping of source and receiver positions and offers a significant inference speedup without crosstalk issues, maintaining similar memory requirements.

Conclusion: The model enhances physical consistency in seismic modeling and can be adapted for more complex wave propagation scenarios using reciprocity principles.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient wavefield modeling underpins seismic structure and source studies. Traditional methods comply with physical laws but are computationally intensive. Data-driven methods, while opening new avenues for advancement, have yet to incorporate strict physical consistency. The principle of reciprocity is one of the most fundamental physical laws in wave propagation. We introduce the Reciprocity-Enforced Neural Operator (RENO), a transformer-based architecture for modeling seismic wave propagation that hard-codes the reciprocity principle. The model leverages the cross-attention mechanism and commutative operations to guarantee invariance under swapping source and receiver positions. Beyond improved physical consistency, the proposed architecture supports simultaneous realizations for multiple sources without crosstalk issues. This yields an order-of-magnitude inference speedup at a similar memory footprint over an reciprocity-unenforced neural operator on a realistic configuration. We demonstrate the functionality using the reciprocity relation for particle velocity fields under single forces. This architecture is also applicable to pressure fields under dilatational sources and travel-time fields governed by the eikonal equation, paving the way for encoding more complex reciprocity relations.

### [474] [Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood Rewards for Multiagent Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11740)
*Ayhan Alp Aydeniz,Robert Loftin,Kagan Tumer*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) rewards to improve multiagent exploration by focusing on each agent's unique contribution to team exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiagent systems require efficient exploration to discover coordinated strategies, especially in complex domains. Redundant exploration arises when agents are unaware of teammates' actions.

Method: Introduce CCL rewards, which isolate and score an agent's unique contribution to the team’s exploration. CCL prioritizes observations informative about team-wide exploration, contrasting prior methods focusing solely on individual novelty.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CCL rewards enhance learning in domains with sparse team rewards and tasks demanding high coordination, outperforming prior exploration methods.

Conclusion: CCL rewards address redundancy in multiagent exploration workflows and enable faster learning of coordinated behavior in complex domains.

Abstract: Efficient exploration is critical for multiagent systems to discover coordinated strategies, particularly in open-ended domains such as search and rescue or planetary surveying. However, when exploration is encouraged only at the individual agent level, it often leads to redundancy, as agents act without awareness of how their teammates are exploring. In this work, we introduce Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) rewards, which score each agent's exploration by isolating its unique contribution to team exploration. Unlike prior methods that reward agents solely for the novelty of their individual observations, CCL emphasizes observations that are informative with respect to the joint exploration of the team. Experiments in continuous multiagent domains show that CCL rewards accelerate learning for domains with sparse team rewards, where most joint actions yield zero rewards, and are particularly effective in tasks that require tight coordination among agents.

TL;DR: Analyzes cooperation and coordination in LLM-based multi-agent systems, highlighting the overlooked influence of communication delays and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous AI agents within LLM-based multi-agent systems to cooperate effectively under real-world constraints like communication and computation.

Method: Introduced the FLCOA framework for analyzing cooperation/coordination in autonomous agents, and performed simulations of agents using a Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma with communication delay.

Result: Discovered a U-shaped relationship between communication delay and mutual cooperation, as agents exploit slower responses. Excessive delays reduce such exploitation cycles.

Conclusion: Future MAS research should address not just high-level design, but also lower-layer factors such as communication delays and resource allocations.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS), in which autonomous AI agents cooperate to solve tasks, are gaining increasing attention. For such systems to be deployed in society, agents must be able to establish cooperation and coordination under real-world computational and communication constraints. We propose the FLCOA framework (Five Layers for Cooperation/Coordination among Autonomous Agents) to conceptualize how cooperation and coordination emerge in groups of autonomous agents, and highlight that the influence of lower-layer factors - especially computational and communication resources - has been largely overlooked. To examine the effect of communication delay, we introduce a Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma with Communication Delay and conduct simulations with LLM-based agents. As delay increases, agents begin to exploit slower responses even without explicit instructions. Interestingly, excessive delay reduces cycles of exploitation, yielding a U-shaped relationship between delay magnitude and mutual cooperation. These results suggest that fostering cooperation requires attention not only to high-level institutional design but also to lower-layer factors such as communication delay and resource allocation, pointing to new directions for MAS research.

### [476] [Sample-Free Safety Assessment of Neural Network Controllers via Taylor Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11332)
*Adam Evans,Roberto Armellin*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to evaluate the safety of neural network feedback controllers using domain splitting and polynomial bounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are effective in complex scenarios as controllers but lack trustworthy verification, limiting their usage in critical applications.

Method: The approach embeds the neural network in system dynamics, uses Taylor polynomials to approximate system flow, and splits domains for efficient safety assessment.

Result: The methodology ensures safety bounds for neural network controllers, enabling informed decisions in operational missions.

Conclusion: By using polynomial analysis and domain splitting, trustworthy neural network controllers can be established for spaceflight applications.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial neural networks have been increasingly studied as feedback controllers for guidance problems. While effective in complex scenarios, they lack the verification guarantees found in classical guidance policies. Their black-box nature creates significant concerns regarding trustworthiness, limiting their adoption in safety-critical spaceflight applications. This work addresses this gap by developing a method to assess the safety of a trained neural network feedback controller via automatic domain splitting and polynomial bounding. The methodology involves embedding the trained neural network into the system's dynamical equations, rendering the closed-loop system autonomous. The system flow is then approximated by high-order Taylor polynomials, which are subsequently manipulated to construct polynomial maps that project state uncertainties onto an event manifold. Automatic domain splitting ensures the polynomials are accurate over their relevant subdomains, whilst also allowing an extensive state-space to be analysed efficiently. Utilising polynomial bounding techniques, the resulting event values may be rigorously constrained and analysed within individual subdomains, thereby establishing bounds on the range of possible closed-loop outcomes from using such neural network controllers and supporting safety assessment and informed operational decision-making in real-world missions.

*Svetlana Churina,Kokil Jaidka,Anab Maulana Barik,Harshit Aneja,Cai Yang,Wynne Hsu,Mong Li Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Althea is a fact-checking system integrating question generation, evidence retrieval, and structured reasoning, achieving substantial improvements in claim verification compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing challenge of verifying online claims efficiently and trustworthily, balancing speed, transparency, and reliability in the digital information landscape.

Method: The system uses a retrieval-augmented approach blending question generation, evidence retrieval, and structured reasoning. It evaluates interaction modes including Exploratory, Summary, and Self-search to assess user-driven claim evaluation.

Result: Althea outperforms standard pipelines on AVeriTeC benchmark with a Macro-F1 score of 0.44. User studies reveal that guided interaction yields better accuracy and confidence, while self-directed modes lead to long-term improvements.

Conclusion: Fact-checking accuracy and trustworthiness are best improved via structured interactions, highlighting the importance of cognitive engagement over mere exposure.

Abstract: The web's information ecosystem demands fact-checking systems that are both scalable and epistemically trustworthy. Automated approaches offer efficiency but often lack transparency, while human verification remains slow and inconsistent. We introduce Althea, a retrieval-augmented system that integrates question generation, evidence retrieval, and structured reasoning to support user-driven evaluation of online claims. On the AVeriTeC benchmark, Althea achieves a Macro-F1 of 0.44, outperforming standard verification pipelines and improving discrimination between supported and refuted claims. We further evaluate Althea through a controlled user study and a longitudinal survey experiment (N = 642), comparing three interaction modes that vary in the degree of scaffolding: an Exploratory mode with guided reasoning, a Summary mode providing synthesized verdicts, and a Self-search mode that offers procedural guidance without algorithmic intervention. Results show that guided interaction produces the strongest immediate gains in accuracy and confidence, while self-directed search yields the most persistent improvements over time. This pattern suggests that performance gains are not driven solely by effort or exposure, but by how cognitive work is structured and internalized.

*Juliana Gerard,Morgan Macleod,Kelly Norwood,Aisling Reid,Muskaan Singh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines how methodologies for comparing AI perception between students and staff can yield varying outcomes depending on the method and analyses used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the degree of variance in measures of AI perception between students and staff using different methodological approaches, and its implications for institutions.

Method: Two forms of qualitative data were collected: standalone comments and structured focus groups. Analyses included sentiment/stance analysis for positivity/negativity and thematic analysis with word clouds for content details.

Result: Findings indicate that different analyses can yield varying results, even when using the same data source, due to differences in measurement focus (e.g., sentiment vs thematic detail).

Conclusion: This variation underscores the need for careful methodological choices, highlighting implications for institutional assessments and the reliability of past comparisons.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare methodological approaches for comparing student and staff perceptions, and ask: how much do these measures vary across different approaches? We focus on the case of AI perceptions, which are generally assessed via a single quantitative or qualitative measure, or with a mixed methods approach that compares two distinct data sources - e.g. a quantitative questionnaire with qualitative comments. To compare different approaches, we collect two forms of qualitative data: standalone comments and structured focus groups. We conduct two analyses for each data source: with a sentiment and stance analysis, we measure overall negativity/positivity of the comments and focus group conversations, respectively. Meanwhile, word clouds from the comments and a thematic analysis of the focus groups provide further detail on the content of this qualitative data - particularly the thematic analysis, which includes both similarities and differences between students and staff. We show that different analyses can produce different results - for a single data source. This variation stems from the construct being evaluated - an overall measure of positivity/negativity can produce a different picture from more detailed content-based analyses. We discuss the implications of this variation for institutional contexts, and for the comparisons from previous studies.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of comprehensive datasets in cultural heritage AI by creating a dataset from a study where 51 museum visitors were equipped with eye-tracking glasses, yielding detailed behavioral and contextual data to improve personalized museum recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the scarcity of open and comprehensive datasets in the cultural heritage domain, as existing data often lack holistic visitor experience modeling due to being ad hoc.

Method: They conducted a study with 51 participants at a museum where visitors were equipped with eye-tracking glasses, exploring exhibits freely for an average of 57 minutes. Data collected included demographic details, preferences, trajectories, and feedback.

Result: An open dataset was built combining demographic, behavioral, and experiential data, enabling reconstruction of visitor identities and profiling based on literature standards.

Conclusion: The dataset can enhance museum recommendations by personalizing visitor paths and optimizing engagement with points of interest based on individual levels of interest.

Abstract: Lack of data is a recurring problem in Artificial Intelligence, as it is essential for training and validating models. This is particularly true in the field of cultural heritage, where the number of open datasets is relatively limited and where the data collected does not always allow for holistic modeling of visitors' experience due to the fact that data are ad hoc (i.e. restricted to the sole characteristics required for the evaluation of a specific model). To overcome this lack, we conducted a study between February and March 2019 aimed at obtaining comprehensive and detailed information about visitors, their visit experience and their feedback. We equipped 51 participants with eye-tracking glasses, leaving them free to explore the 3 floors of the museum for an average of 57 minutes, and to discover an exhibition of more than 400 artworks. On this basis, we built an open dataset combining contextual data (demographic data, preferences, visiting habits, motivations, social context. . . ), behavioral data (spatiotemporal trajectories, gaze data) and feedback (satisfaction, fatigue, liked artworks, verbatim. . . ). Our analysis made it possible to re-enact visitor identities combining the majority of characteristics found in the literature and to reproduce the Veron and Levasseur profiles. This dataset will ultimately make it possible to improve the quality of recommended paths in museums by personalizing the number of points of interest (POIs), the time spent at these different POIs, and the amount of information to be provided to each visitor based on their level of interest.

TL;DR: The paper explores Theory of Mind (ToM) in AI, revealing three design recommendations for integrating ToM into user-facing AI in real-world contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities in AI could transform user-facing products while addressing gaps in AI design practices.

Method: 13 co-design sessions with 26 U.S.-based AI practitioners to explore ToM applications and derive design recommendations.

Result: Three key design recommendations for ToM-enabled AI: considering social context, dynamic mental states, and individual differences, alongside design tensions arising from current practices.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes a shift from static ToM inference to dynamic interaction-based approaches supporting continuous human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) -- the ability to infer what others are thinking (e.g., intentions) from observable cues -- is traditionally considered fundamental to human social interactions. This has sparked growing efforts in building and benchmarking AI's ToM capability, yet little is known about how such capability could translate into the design and experience of everyday user-facing AI products and services. We conducted 13 co-design sessions with 26 U.S.-based AI practitioners to envision, reflect, and distill design recommendations for ToM-enabled everyday AI products and services that are both future-looking and grounded in the realities of AI design and development practices. Analysis revealed three interrelated design recommendations: ToM-enabled AI should 1) be situated in the social context that shape users' mental states, 2) be responsive to the dynamic nature of mental states, and 3) be attuned to subjective individual differences. We surface design tensions within each recommendation that reveal a broader gap between practitioners' envisioned futures of ToM-enabled AI and the realities of current AI design and development practices. These findings point toward the need to move beyond static, inference-driven approach to ToM and toward designing ToM as a pervasive capability that supports continuous human-AI interaction loops.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Knowledge-based Persuasion Model (KPM) to improve understanding and development of generative social agents (GSAs) and their influence on human users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical frameworks for understanding and guiding the interactions and influence of generative social agents on user attitudes and behaviors.

Method: The KPM synthesizes existing research and introduces a structured theoretical approach that focuses on a GSA's knowledge about itself, the user, and the context to drive persuasive behavior.

Result: The KPM highlights the potential to create GSAs that motivate users ethically and support user wellbeing, promoting responsible AI use in domains like healthcare and education.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the KPM framework provides essential guidelines for developing responsible and ethical GSAs that positively influence users' attitudes and behaviors in adaptive and socially responsible ways.

Abstract: Generative social agents (GSAs) use artificial intelligence to autonomously communicate with human users in a natural and adaptive manner. Currently, there is a lack of theorizing regarding interactions with GSAs, and likewise, few guidelines exist for studying how they influence user attitudes and behaviors. Consequently, we propose the Knowledge-based Persuasion Model (KPM) as a novel theoretical framework. According to the KPM, a GSA's self, user, and context-related knowledge drives its persuasive behavior, which in turn shapes the attitudes and behaviors of a responding human user. By synthesizing existing research, the model offers a structured approach to studying interactions with GSAs, supporting the development of agents that motivate rather than manipulate humans. Accordingly, the KPM encourages the integration of responsible GSAs that adhere to social norms and ethical standards with the goal of increasing user wellbeing. Implications of the KPM for research and application domains such as healthcare and education are discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how socio-technical interaction patterns between humans and LLMs affect collaborative decision-making in impactful domains.

Method: The authors conducted a scoping literature review and thematic analysis of 113 LLM-supported decision-making papers, followed by real-world evaluations in clinical diagnostic cases.

Result: 17 human-LLM archetypes were identified and analyzed with tradeoffs like decision control, hierarchies, and cognitive strategies influencing outcomes.

Conclusion: Human-LLM archetypes significantly impact decision outcomes, highlighting critical risks and considerations for designing optimal human-AI systems.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly supporting decision-making across high-stakes domains, requiring critical reflection on the socio-technical factors that shape how humans and LLMs are assigned roles and interact during human-in-the-loop decision-making. This paper introduces the concept of human-LLM archetypes -- defined as re-curring socio-technical interaction patterns that structure the roles of humans and LLMs in collaborative decision-making. We describe 17 human-LLM archetypes derived from a scoping literature review and thematic analysis of 113 LLM-supported decision-making papers. Then, we evaluate these diverse archetypes across real-world clinical diagnostic cases to examine the potential effects of adopting distinct human-LLM archetypes on LLM outputs and decision outcomes. Finally, we present relevant tradeoffs and design choices across human-LLM archetypes, including decision control, social hierarchies, cognitive forcing strategies, and information requirements. Through our analysis, we show that selection of human-LLM interaction archetype can influence LLM outputs and decisions, bringing important risks and considerations for the designers of human-AI decision-making systems

Motivation: Investigating dynamics of communication, opinion formation, and deliberation on digital platforms amidst challenges like restricted data and ethical constraints.

Method: Developed VIRENA, a simulation platform replicating realistic social media and messaging apps, combining human users and AI agents with no-code functionality for researchers.

Result: VIRENA allows experimental designs to study human-AI interactions, test moderation strategies, and observe group deliberation, ensuring data protection and ease of use.

Conclusion: VIRENA is accessible to researchers and organizations, advancing realistic social media simulation and experimentation across disciplines and sectors.

Abstract: Digital platforms shape how people communicate, deliberate, and form opinions.

VIRENA (Virtual Arena) is a platform that enables controlled experimentation in realistic social media environments. Multiple participants interact simultaneously in realistic replicas of feed-based platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Reddit) and messaging apps (WhatsApp, Messenger).

*Yitian Wang,Fanmeng Wang,Angxiao Yue,Wentao Guo,Yaning Cui,Hongteng Xu*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: This paper introduces MuCO, a novel method for generating and optimizing cyclic peptide conformations, outperforming existing approaches in stability, diversity, structure recovery, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of modeling cyclic peptide conformations, which is crucial for virtual screening of peptides with desired properties but difficult due to their complex ring-shaped structures.

Method: MuCO decouples cyclic peptide modeling into three stages: topology-aware backbone design, generative side-chain packing, and physics-aware all-atom optimization, utilizing a coarse-to-fine process for efficient sampling.

Result: MuCO demonstrated superior performance on a large dataset (CPSea), consistently achieving greater stability, diversity, secondary structure recovery, and computational efficiency compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: MuCO is a promising tool for designing cyclic peptides by successfully tackling challenges in predicting their conformations and performing efficient, diverse, and accurate generation.

Abstract: Modeling peptide cyclization is critical for the virtual screening of candidate peptides with desirable physical and pharmaceutical properties. This task is challenging because a cyclic peptide often exhibits diverse, ring-shaped conformations, which cannot be well captured by deterministic prediction models derived from linear peptide folding. In this study, we propose MuCO (Multi-stage Conformation Optimization), a generative peptide cyclization method that models the distribution of cyclic peptide conformations conditioned on the corresponding linear peptide. In principle, MuCO decouples the peptide cyclization task into three stages: topology-aware backbone design, generative side-chain packing, and physics-aware all-atom optimization, thereby generating and optimizing conformations of cyclic peptides in a coarse-to-fine manner. This multi-stage framework enables an efficient parallel sampling strategy for conformation generation and allows for rapid exploration of diverse, low-energy conformations. Experiments on the large-scale CPSea dataset demonstrate that MuCO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in consistently in physical stability, structural diversity, secondary structure recovery, and computational efficiency, making it a promising computational tool for exploring and designing cyclic peptides.

TL;DR: HABIT is a framework designed to handle missing AIS data in vessel trajectories, providing accurate imputations with faster processing times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving vessel trajectory analysis, hindered by gaps in AIS data. Existing models fail to address unique maritime motion patterns.

Method: HABIT utilizes historical AIS data to extract and index vessel motion patterns using an H3 aggregation-based framework.

Result: HABIT achieves comparable accuracy to existing methods while offering better latency and accounting for vessel-specific motion behaviors.

Conclusion: HABIT is an effective, configurable tool for imputing missing vessel trajectory data, optimizing maritime data analysis.

Abstract: Modeling vessel activity at sea is critical for a wide range of applications, including route planning, transportation logistics, maritime safety, and environmental monitoring. Over the past two decades, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has enabled real-time monitoring of hundreds of thousands of vessels, generating huge amounts of data daily. One major challenge in using AIS data is the presence of large gaps in vessel trajectories, often caused by coverage limitations or intentional transmission interruptions. These gaps can significantly degrade data quality, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete analysis. State-of-the-art imputation approaches have mainly been devised to tackle gaps in vehicle trajectories, even when the underlying road network is not considered. But the motion patterns of sailing vessels differ substantially, e.g., smooth turns, maneuvering near ports, or navigating in adverse weather conditions. In this application paper, we propose HABIT, a lightweight, configurable H3 Aggregation-Based Imputation framework for vessel Trajectories. This data-driven framework provides a valuable means to impute missing trajectory segments by extracting, analyzing, and indexing motion patterns from historical AIS data. Our empirical study over AIS data across various timeframes, densities, and vessel types reveals that HABIT produces maritime trajectory imputations performing comparably to baseline methods in terms of accuracy, while performing better in terms of latency while accounting for vessel characteristics and their motion patterns.

*Zehao Xia,Yiqun Wang,Zhengda Lu,Kai Liu,Jun Xiao,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: OMEGA-Avatar is a framework creating realistic, fully animatable 3D avatars from one image, overcoming previous limitations in 360° modeling and animation readiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of creating fully textured and animatable 3D avatars from a single image with 360° views, an area where current methods fail to address all essential attributes simultaneously.

Method: The authors propose OMEGA-Avatar, featuring two novel modules: (1) a semantic-aware mesh deformation module for better full-head and hair modeling, and (2) a multi-view feature splatting module for 360° feature consistency using UV mapping techniques.

Result: OMEGA-Avatar achieves state-of-the-art performance, generating avatars that are both complete in 360° and animatable while preserving identity and finer details across various angles.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances the field by enabling the generation of generalizable, fully 3D animatable avatars from a single image with improved completeness and identity preservation.

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D avatars from a single image remains a formidable challenge. We identified three desirable attributes of avatar generation: 1) the method should be feed-forward, 2) model a 360° full-head, and 3) should be animation-ready. However, current work addresses only two of the three points simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360°-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360° full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion. This approach preserves both global structural coherence and local high-frequency details across all viewpoints, ensuring 360° consistency without per-instance optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMEGA-Avatar achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines in 360° full-head completeness while robustly preserving identity across different viewpoints.

TL;DR: VF-Editor introduces a native editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting by using a variation predictor distilled from 2D editing knowledge, overcoming limitations of indirect editing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing indirect editing methods for 3D Gaussian Splatting introduce cross-view inconsistencies, limiting efficiency and flexibility. Hence, a direct editing method was needed.

Method: The paper proposes VF-Editor, which uses a novel variation predictor to directly predict attribute variations for 3D Gaussian primitives in a feedforward manner. The predictor encodes inputs into a variation field and employs dual decoding functions for iterative attribute inference.

Result: VF-Editor demonstrated effectiveness, flexibility, and addressed limitations of indirect editing pipelines through extensive tests on both public and private datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed VF-Editor significantly improves upon indirect 3D Gaussian editing methods by providing a unified design for seamless 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer and efficient attribute estimation.

Abstract: Indirect editing methods for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently witnessed significant advancements. These approaches operate by first applying edits in the rendered 2D space and subsequently projecting the modifications back into 3D. However, this paradigm inevitably introduces cross-view inconsistencies and constrains both the flexibility and efficiency of the editing process. To address these challenges, we present VF-Editor, which enables native editing of Gaussian primitives by predicting attribute variations in a feedforward manner. To accurately and efficiently estimate these variations, we design a novel variation predictor distilled from 2D editing knowledge. The predictor encodes the input to generate a variation field and employs two learnable, parallel decoding functions to iteratively infer attribute changes for each 3D Gaussian. Thanks to its unified design, VF-Editor can seamlessly distill editing knowledge from diverse 2D editors and strategies into a single predictor, allowing for flexible and effective knowledge transfer into the 3D domain. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets reveal the inherent limitations of indirect editing pipelines and validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.

*Ayush Varshney,Katherine L. Bouman,Berthy T. Feng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper tackles imaging inverse problems using a diffusion-based method integrated with a modified variational inference framework. It improves efficiency and quality of generated images compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in imaging inverse problems, particularly the inefficiency and lack of detail in existing diffusion-based generative approaches.

Method: The paper extends amortized variational inference frameworks by incorporating spatially adaptive perturbations during training, guided by uncertainty estimates.

Result: The proposed method outperforms or is competitive with prior diffusion-based approaches in deblurring and super-resolution tasks, achieving realistic reconstructions efficiently.

Conclusion: The integration of adaptive perturbations effectively enhances the detail and realism in reconstructions, providing a computationally efficient solution for imaging inverse problems.

Abstract: Ill-posed imaging inverse problems remain challenging due to the ambiguity in mapping degraded observations to clean images. Diffusion-based generative priors have recently shown promise, but typically rely on computationally intensive iterative sampling or per-instance optimization. Amortized variational inference frameworks address this inefficiency by learning a direct mapping from measurements to posteriors, enabling fast posterior sampling without requiring the optimization of a new posterior for every new set of measurements. However, they still struggle to reconstruct fine details and complex textures. To address this, we extend the amortized framework by injecting spatially adaptive perturbations to measurements during training, guided by uncertainty estimates, to emphasize learning in the most uncertain regions. Experiments on deblurring and super-resolution demonstrate that our method achieves superior or competitive performance to previous diffusion-based approaches, delivering more realistic reconstructions without the computational cost of iterative refinement.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses NR-VQA challenges, showing the potential of leveraging full-reference metrics and multi-task learning for better gaming video quality assessments.

Abstract: No-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) for gaming videos is challenging due to limited human-rated datasets and unique content characteristics including fast motion, stylized graphics, and compression artifacts. We present MTL-VQA, a multi-task learning framework that uses full-reference metrics as supervisory signals to learn perceptually meaningful features without human labels for pretraining. By jointly optimizing multiple full-reference (FR) objectives with adaptive task weighting, our approach learns shared representations that transfer effectively to NR-VQA. Experiments on gaming video datasets show MTL-VQA achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art NR-VQA methods across both MOS-supervised and label-efficient/self-supervised settings.

*Bingxu Xie,Fang Zhou,Jincan Wu,Yonghui Liu,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the first unsupervised progressive domain adaptation (UPDA) framework for improving no-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) models' performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NR-PCQA models fail when there is a distribution gap between source and target domains, and overcoming this limitation has not been sufficiently addressed.

Method: A two-stage coarse-to-fine alignment framework is proposed. Coarse-grained alignment uses a novel hybrid loss to handle quality relationships, while fine-grained alignment employs symmetric feature fusion and selective quality-relevant feature transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments show the UPDA significantly improves cross-domain performance of NR-PCQA models, making it more practical.

Conclusion: The UPDA framework is effective for domain adaptation in NR-PCQA, bridging quality assessment gaps between training and testing datasets.

Abstract: While no-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) approaches have achieved significant progress over the past decade, their performance often degrades substantially when a distribution gap exists between the training (source domain) and testing (target domain) data. However, to date, limited attention has been paid to transferring NR-PCQA models across domains. To address this challenge, we propose the first unsupervised progressive domain adaptation (UPDA) framework for NR-PCQA, which introduces a two-stage coarse-to-fine alignment paradigm to address domain shifts. At the coarse-grained stage, a discrepancy-aware coarse-grained alignment method is designed to capture relative quality relationships between cross-domain samples through a novel quality-discrepancy-aware hybrid loss, circumventing the challenges of direct absolute feature alignment. At the fine-grained stage, a perception fusion fine-grained alignment approach with symmetric feature fusion is developed to identify domain-invariant features, while a conditional discriminator selectively enhances the transfer of quality-relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed UPDA effectively enhances the performance of NR-PCQA methods in cross-domain scenarios, validating its practical applicability.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: GORGO improves latency in distributed Large Language Model inference by optimizing network-aware routing and caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in geographically distributed LLM inference while addressing network latency limitations.

Method: Developed GORGO, a routing method optimizing serving costs considering compute, network latency, and prefix caching; performed component profiling and benchmarking against multiple baselines.

Result: GORGO achieves reduced P99 TTFT, lowers average TTFT through network-aware routing, and enhances efficiency with centralized routing methods.

Conclusion: GORGO successfully minimizes TTFT using network-aware routing and caching strategies, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Distributing LLM inference across geographical regions can improve Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by regionalizing service deployments. While existing multi-region load balancers save prefill computation by prioritizing Key--Value (KV) Cache hit rate, they ignore cluster networking latency, a critical factor in routing decisions. We introduce GORGO, a method for minimizing TTFT by optimizing a total serving cost as a function of available compute, network latency, and prefix caching. Using extensive profiling on custom infrastructure, we analyze component-level latency bottlenecks and benchmark GORGO against three baselines: (1) naive least-load routing, which ignores prefix-cache overlap; (2) prefix-similarity routing, which selectively pushes requests to the replica with the highest cached-prefix overlap; and (3) a centralized HTTP proxy that runs the GORGO policy while tracking requests across all nodes. We demonstrate that GORGO reduces P99 TTFT through network-aware routing and improves average TTFT by preventing pathological cross-region forwarding. Additionally, we find that GORGO-proxy overcomes synchronization overhead in previous methods and is 2.5x faster on median TTFT, demonstrating the success of a centralized router.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the significant energy consumption of CMOS-based technologies by investigating new, energy-efficient information-processing methods.

Method: The research utilizes dynamical computing, leveraging potential energy landscapes with metastable minima, and analyzes computational protocols via bifurcation theory.

Result: 1-bit and 2-bit computations were demonstrated using double-well and quadruple-well potentials, showcasing the design of universal logic gates.

Conclusion: Dynamical computing, based on metastable energy states, offers a promising framework for designing energy-efficient computational systems and understanding their thermodynamic properties.

Abstract: Smartphones, laptops, and data centers are CMOS-based technologies that ushered our world into the information age of the 21st century. Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively. These illustrate how dynamical computing can serve as a basis for designing universal logic gates and investigating their out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve nonparametric regression by achieving high-probability minimax-optimal results that adapt to noise without requiring prior knowledge of noise variance or arbitrary tuning.

Method: The authors propose a wavelet-based adaptive online algorithm that dynamically clips gradient noise and uses online-to-batch conversion with self-normalized concentration inequalities.

Result: The paper achieves adaptive and minimax-optimal estimation rates for Besov spaces and establishes high-probability adaptive regret bounds.

Conclusion: The presented method provides an innovative solution to adaptive regression, eliminating manual parameter tuning and ensuring robust statistical guarantees.

Abstract: We study nonparametric regression over Besov spaces from noisy observations under sub-exponential noise, aiming to achieve minimax-optimal guarantees on the integrated squared error that hold with high probability and adapt to the unknown noise level. To this end, we propose a wavelet-based online learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the observed gradient noise by adaptively clipping it at an appropriate level, eliminating the need to tune parameters such as the noise variance or gradient bounds. As a by-product of our analysis, we derive high-probability adaptive regret bounds that scale with the $\ell_1$-norm of the competitor. Finally, in the batch statistical setting, we obtain adaptive and minimax-optimal estimation rates for Besov spaces via a refined online-to-batch conversion. This approach carefully exploits the structure of the squared loss in combination with self-normalized concentration inequalities.

TL;DR: This paper identifies computational limits of machine learning, showing that certain non-trivial mixed-state phases are hard to learn, especially due to long-range conditional mutual information (CMI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand fundamental bounds of machine learning in capturing complex global properties of distributions, especially in unsupervised learning tasks.

Method: The method includes theoretical analysis of CMI as a diagnostic tool, introduction of a restricted statistical query model, and validation using neural networks to tackle learning in specific physical systems.

Result: The authors demonstrate that distributions with long-range CMI are computationally hard to learn and validate this using neural networks applied to toric/surface codes under noise.

Conclusion: The analysis highlights the diagnostic power of CMI and suggests non-local Gibbsness as a metric for learning difficulty, contributing valuable insights to the study of mixed-state phases and machine learning.

Abstract: We identify fundamental limitations in machine learning by demonstrating that non-trivial mixed-state phases of matter are computationally hard to learn. Focusing on unsupervised learning of distributions, we show that autoregressive neural networks fail to learn global properties of distributions characterized by locally indistinguishable (LI) states. We demonstrate that conditional mutual information (CMI) is a useful diagnostic for LI: we show that for classical distributions, long-range CMI of a state implies a spatially LI partner. By introducing a restricted statistical query model, we prove that nontrivial phases with long-range CMI, such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, are hard to learn. We validate our claims by using recurrent, convolutional, and Transformer neural networks to learn the syndrome and physical distributions of toric/surface code under bit flip noise. Our findings suggest hardness of learning as a diagnostic tool for detecting mixed-state phases and transitions and error-correction thresholds, and they suggest CMI and more generally ``non-local Gibbsness'' as metrics for how hard a distribution is to learn.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address inefficiencies and computational challenges posed by cross-fitting in DML, especially when dealing with complex first-stage learners and multiway clustered dependence.

Method: The authors utilize Neyman-orthogonal moment conditions and a localisation-based empirical process approach to construct DML-GMM estimators without the need for sample splitting, while considering multiway-clustered dependencies.

Result: The proposed DML-GMM estimators are asymptotically linear and normal under multiway clustered dependence, supported by new inequalities for sums of separately exchangeable arrays.

Conclusion: The paper provides a statistically efficient method for DML-GMM inference in complex settings, offering a viable alternative to cross-fitting approaches and valuable theoretical contributions.

Abstract: This paper develops an asymptotic theory for two-step debiased machine learning (DML) estimators in generalised method of moments (GMM) models with general multiway clustered dependence, without relying on cross-fitting. While cross-fitting is commonly employed, it can be statistically inefficient and computationally burdensome when first-stage learners are complex and the effective sample size is governed by the number of independent clusters. We show that valid inference can be achieved without sample splitting by combining Neyman-orthogonal moment conditions with a localisation-based empirical process approach, allowing for an arbitrary number of clustering dimensions. The resulting DML-GMM estimators are shown to be asymptotically linear and asymptotically normal under multiway clustered dependence. A central technical contribution of the paper is the derivation of novel global and local maximal inequalities for general classes of functions of sums of separately exchangeable arrays, which underpin our theoretical arguments and are of independent interest.

*Yechan Park,Xiaodong Yang*

TL;DR: This paper examines the implications of exposure-based estimands under interference by defining a marginal policy effect, exploring decomposition into direct and spillover effects, and discussing robustness in experimental settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand what policy objects exposure-based estimands under interference are targeting and interpret direct and spillover effects accurately for applications in empirical and theoretical settings.

Method: The study develops a framework using the marginal policy effect, deriving a pseudo-true outcome model induced by exposure mapping, and decomposing the marginal policy effect into direct, local, and global components.

Result: The paper demonstrates that many methods are more robust than expected by reinterpreting their targets as components of a pseudo-true policy estimand. It shows recovery of these components in simulations and semi-synthetic experiments calibrated to a large-scale study.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the robustness and interpretability of exposure-based methods when viewed through the lens of channel-specific components of the marginal policy effect, offering insights for interference modeling.

Abstract: Applied work with interference typically models outcomes as functions of own treatment and a low-dimensional exposure mapping of others' treatments, even when that mapping may be misspecified. This raises a basic question: what policy object are exposure-based estimands implicitly targeting, and how should we interpret their direct and spillover components relative to the underlying policy question? We take as primitive the marginal policy effect, defined as the effect of a small change in the treatment probability under the actual experimental design, and show that any researcher-chosen exposure mapping induces a unique pseudo-true outcome model. This model is the best approximation to the underlying potential outcomes that depends only on the user-chosen exposure. Utilizing that representation, the marginal policy effect admits a canonical decomposition into exposure-based direct and spillover effects, and each component provides its optimal approximation to the corresponding oracle objects that would be available if interference were fully known. We then focus on a setting that nests important empirical and theoretical applications in which both local network spillovers and global spillovers, such as market equilibrium, operate. There, the marginal policy effect further decomposes asymptotically into direct, local, and global channels. An important implication is that many existing methods are more robust than previously understood once we reinterpret their targets as channel-specific components of this pseudo-true policy estimand.

### [500] [Improved Inference for CSDID Using the Cluster Jackknife](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12043)
*Sunny R. Karim,Morten Ørregaard Nielsen,James G. MacKinnon,Matthew D. Webb*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: This paper discusses issues with traditional DiD and the CSDID estimator, proposing a cluster jackknife method that improves inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable inferences using traditional DiD methods are challenging due to serial correlation in outcomes and errors, imbalance in clusters, and other technical issues, prompting the exploration of more robust approaches.

Method: The paper assesses inference problems in the recent CSDID procedure and introduces a cluster jackknife method for calculating standard errors, evaluated using simulations.

Result: The proposed cluster jackknife improves inference reliability for CSDID, addressing issues of over-rejection with few clusters and/or few treated clusters.

Conclusion: Cluster jackknife enhances inference quality in CSDID, and the authors provide software tools to facilitate its use in statistical analysis.

Abstract: Obtaining reliable inferences with traditional difference-in-differences (DiD) methods can be difficult. Problems can arise when both outcomes and errors are serially correlated, when there are few clusters or few treated clusters, when cluster sizes vary greatly, and in various other cases. In recent years, recognition of the ``staggered adoption'' problem has shifted the focus away from inference towards consistent estimation of treatment effects. One of the most popular new estimators is the CSDID procedure of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021). We find that the issues of over-rejection with few clusters and/or few treated clusters are at least as severe for CSDID as for traditional DiD methods. We also propose using a cluster jackknife for inference with CSDID, which simulations suggest greatly improves inference. We provide software packages in Stata csdidjack and R didjack to calculate cluster-jackknife standard errors easily.

### [501] [On the implicit regularization of Langevin dynamics with projected noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12257)
*Govind Menon,Austin J. Stromme,Adrien Vacher*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper explores a mathematical model of Langevin dynamics with noise adjusted for symmetries, revealing a novel implicit regularization tied to group orbits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the influence of symmetries in stochastic gradient descent for over-parameterized models, particularly through Langevin dynamics.

Method: The authors analyze projected Langevin dynamics, construct couplings between noise types, and connect symmetry invariants to the process' behavior.

Result: The main finding is an equivalence between the adjusted Langevin dynamics and the standard version, with the addition of a drift term linked to group orbit geometry.

Conclusion: Projected Langevin dynamics provides insights into implicit regularization caused by symmetry and its effect on optimization processes.

Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics with noise projected onto the directions orthogonal to an isometric group action. This mathematical model is introduced to shed new light on the effects of symmetry on stochastic gradient descent for over-parametrized models. Our main result identifies a novel form of implicit regularization: when the initial and target density are both invariant under the group action, Langevin dynamics with projected noise is equivalent in law to Langevin dynamics with isotropic diffusion but with an additional drift term proportional to the negative log volume of the group orbit. We prove this result by constructing a coupling of the two processes via a third process on the group itself, and identify the additional drift as the mean curvature of the orbits.

*Yuanxin Xia,Xinyan Li,Matteo Calafà,Allan P. Engsig-Karup,Cheol-Ho Jeong*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes and validates a physics-informed neural field for reconstructing broadband sound fields and inferring complex surface impedance from sparse pressure samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized methods for characterizing absorbing materials often fail to reflect real-world acoustic conditions, necessitating improved in-situ characterization methods.

Method: The authors developed a physics-informed neural network to reconstruct local sound fields from sparse data, enabling broadband impedance retrieval. They also created a compact microphone array for validation purposes.

Result: The method achieved accurate impedance retrieval in both numerical and laboratory experiments with minimal sensors, and it was successfully applied in a vehicle cabin for practical measurement guidance.

Conclusion: This neural field approach provides a robust and efficient solution for in-situ acoustic characterization of surfaces in fields like architectural and automotive acoustics.

Abstract: Standardized laboratory characterizations for absorbing materials rely on idealized sound field assumptions, which deviate largely from real-life conditions. Consequently, \emph{in-situ} acoustic characterization has become essential for accurate diagnosis and virtual prototyping. We propose a physics-informed neural field that reconstructs local, near-surface broadband sound fields from sparse pressure samples to directly infer complex surface impedance. A parallel, multi-frequency architecture enables a broadband impedance retrieval within runtimes on the order of seconds to minutes. To validate the method, we developed a compact microphone array with low hardware complexity. Numerical verifications and laboratory experiments demonstrate accurate impedance retrieval with a small number of sensors under realistic conditions. We further showcase the approach in a vehicle cabin to provide practical guidance on measurement locations that avoid strong interference. Here, we show that this approach offers a robust means of characterizing \emph{in-situ} boundary conditions for architectural and automotive acoustics.

*Daiqing Wu,Xuan Zhang,Dongbao Yang,Jiashu Yao,Longfei Chen,Qingsong Liu,Sicheng Zhao,Can Ma,Yangyang Kang,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces Echo, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) that employs audio-interleaved reasoning for better comprehension by dynamically re-listening to audio as needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the information bottleneck in current LALMs that only rely on a one-time audio encoding, limiting their ability to deeply comprehend audio in ways similar to human cognition.

Method: The proposed method introduces audio-interleaved reasoning and implements it through a two-stage framework: supervised fine-tuning to localize salient audio segments and reinforcement learning to reward effective re-listening. Additionally, a data generation pipeline is created for producing high-quality training materials.

Result: Echo outperforms existing models in audio comprehension benchmarks, excelling in both expert and general-purpose tasks and demonstrating efficiency and generalizability.

Conclusion: Audio-interleaved reasoning is a promising approach for advancing audio comprehension, marking a step forward for LALMs in achieving human-like reasoning and perception.

Abstract: The maturation of Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) has raised growing expectations for them to comprehend complex audio much like humans. Current efforts primarily replicate text-based reasoning by contextualizing audio content through a one-time encoding, which introduces a critical information bottleneck. Drawing inspiration from human cognition, we propose audio-interleaved reasoning to break through this bottleneck. It treats audio as an active reasoning component, enabling sustained audio engagement and perception-grounded analysis. To instantiate it, we introduce a two-stage training framework, first teaching LALMs to localize salient audio segments through supervised fine-tuning, and then incentivizing proficient re-listening via reinforcement learning. In parallel, a structured data generation pipeline is developed to produce high-quality training data. Consequently, we present Echo, a LALM capable of dynamically re-listening to audio in demand during reasoning. On audio comprehension benchmarks, Echo achieves overall superiority in both challenging expert-level and general-purpose tasks. Comprehensive analysis further confirms the efficiency and generalizability of audio-interleaved reasoning, establishing it as a promising direction for advancing audio comprehension.

*Łukasz Staniszewski,Katarzyna Zaleska,Mateusz Modrzejewski,Kamil Deja*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper analyzes audio diffusion models to identify how high-level musical concepts, like instruments or genres, are represented in their architectures. It discovers that specific attention layers control these concepts and leverages this finding for precise audio generation control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how audio diffusion models internalize and control high-level musical concepts can enhance their utility and precision in music generation.

Method: The authors use activation patching to find attention layers controlling semantic musical concepts and apply Contrastive Activation Addition with Sparse Autoencoders to achieve fine-grained control over audio generation.

Result: The study identified a subset of attention layers responsible for semantic control and demonstrated precise modulation of musical features such as tempo and mood through layer steering.

Conclusion: These findings show that specialization in attention layers can be exploited for improved control in audio diffusion models, paving the way for advancements in music synthesis technology.

Abstract: Audio diffusion models can synthesize high-fidelity music from text, yet their internal mechanisms for representing high-level concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we use activation patching to demonstrate that distinct semantic musical concepts, such as the presence of specific instruments, vocals, or genre characteristics, are controlled by a small, shared subset of attention layers in state-of-the-art audio diffusion architectures. Next, we demonstrate that applying Contrastive Activation Addition and Sparse Autoencoders in these layers enables more precise control over the generated audio, indicating a direct benefit of the specialization phenomenon. By steering activations of the identified layers, we can alter specific musical elements with high precision, such as modulating tempo or changing a track's mood.

### [505] [Analytical Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11581)
*Yiteng Tu,Shuo Miao,Weihang Su,Yiqun Liu,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'analytical search' as a next-generation search paradigm designed for handling complex analytical queries efficiently and verifiably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current search paradigms fail to address end-to-end analytical tasks like trend analysis and causal impact assessment, particularly for complex analytical needs that require diverse reasoning, evidence usage, and verification.

Method: The authors propose a new paradigm called analytical search, which involves evidence-driven, process-oriented workflows. The system integrates query understanding, retrieval, reasoning, evidence fusion, and verification for multi-step inference.

Result: The paper provides a unified framework for analytical search and positions it as a superior alternative to conventional paradigms like document ranking or RAG for analytical use cases.

Conclusion: The proposed analytical search framework addresses key limitations in existing search paradigms, highlighting its importance for advancing search engines capable of meeting analytical information needs.

Abstract: Analytical information needs, such as trend analysis and causal impact assessment, are prevalent across various domains including law, finance, science, and much more. However, existing information retrieval paradigms, whether based on relevance-oriented document ranking or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs), often struggle to meet the end-to-end requirements of such tasks at the corpus scale. They either emphasize information finding rather than end-to-end problem solving, or simply treat everything as naive question answering, offering limited control over reasoning, evidence usage, and verifiability. As a result, they struggle to support analytical queries that have diverse utility concepts and high accountability requirements.
  In this paper, we propose analytical search as a distinct and emerging search paradigm designed to fulfill these analytical information needs. Analytical search reframes search as an evidence-governed, process-oriented analytical workflow that explicitly models analytical intent, retrieves evidence for fusion, and produces verifiable conclusions through structured, multi-step inference. We position analytical search in contrast to existing paradigms, and present a unified system framework that integrates query understanding, recall-oriented retrieval, reasoning-aware fusion, and adaptive verification. We also discuss potential research directions for the construction of analytical search engines. In this way, we highlight the conceptual significance and practical importance of analytical search and call on efforts toward the next generation of search engines that support analytical information needs.

### [506] [From Noise to Order: Learning to Rank via Denoising Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11453)
*Sajad Ebrahimi,Bhaskar Mitra,Negar Arabzadeh,Ye Yuan,Haolun Wu,Fattane Zarrinkalam,Ebrahim Bagheri*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiffusionRank, a generative approach for learning-to-rank using denoising diffusion models, and demonstrates its effectiveness over traditional discriminative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discriminative learning-to-rank models often struggle with robustness because they focus only on fitting the training data without modeling the entire data distribution.

Method: The authors propose DiffusionRank, which extends TabDiff by modeling the full joint distribution of feature vectors and relevance labels, and provides generative equivalents to classical ranking objectives.

Result: Empirical results show that DiffusionRank significantly outperforms traditional discriminative models in ranking tasks.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based generative models, like DiffusionRank, open new research opportunities for improving learning-to-rank in information retrieval.

Abstract: In information retrieval (IR), learning-to-rank (LTR) methods have traditionally limited themselves to discriminative machine learning approaches that model the probability of the document being relevant to the query given some feature representation of the query-document pair. In this work, we propose an alternative denoising diffusion-based deep generative approach to LTR that instead models the full joint distribution over feature vectors and relevance labels. While in the discriminative setting, an over-parameterized ranking model may find different ways to fit the training data, we hypothesize that candidate solutions that can explain the full data distribution under the generative setting produce more robust ranking models. With this motivation, we propose DiffusionRank that extends TabDiff, an existing denoising diffusion-based generative model for tabular datasets, to create generative equivalents of classical discriminative pointwise and pairwise LTR objectives. Our empirical results demonstrate significant improvements from DiffusionRank models over their discriminative counterparts. Our work points to a rich space for future research exploration on how we can leverage ongoing advancements in deep generative modeling approaches, such as diffusion, for learning-to-rank in IR.

### [507] [ULTRA:Urdu Language Transformer-based Recommendation Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11836)
*Alishbah Bashir,Fatima Qaiser,Ijaz Hussain*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes ULTRA, an Urdu language recommendation system using transformers to improve semantic relevance in news retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu, as a low-resource language, lacks effective semantic recommendation systems, particularly for personalized news retrieval.

Method: ULTRA uses a dual-embedding architecture with a query-length aware routing mechanism to dynamically process and recommend relevant news content.

Result: Experiments on a large-scale Urdu news corpus show ULTRA outperforms baseline systems with over 90% precision.

Conclusion: ULTRA provides an adaptable, generalizable framework for semantic content retrieval, particularly effective for low-resource languages like Urdu.

Abstract: Urdu, as a low-resource language, lacks effective semantic content recommendation systems, particularly in the domain of personalized news retrieval. Existing approaches largely rely on lexical matching or language-agnostic techniques, which struggle to capture semantic intent and perform poorly under varying query lengths and information needs. This limitation results in reduced relevance and adaptability in Urdu content recommendation. We propose ULTRA (Urdu Language Transformer-based Recommendation Architecture),an adaptive semantic recommendation framework designed to address these challenges. ULTRA introduces a dual-embedding architecture with a query-length aware routing mechanism that dynamically distinguishes between short, intent-focused queries and longer, context-rich queries. Based on a threshold-driven decision process, user queries are routed to specialized semantic pipelines optimized for either title/headline-level or full-content/document level representations, ensuring appropriate semantic granularity during retrieval. The proposed system leverages transformer-based embeddings and optimized pooling strategies to move beyond surface-level keyword matching and enable context-aware similarity search. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale Urdu news corpus demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently improves recommendation relevance across diverse query types. Results show gains in precision above 90% compared to single-pipeline baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of query-adaptive semantic alignment for low-resource languages. The findings establish ULTRA as a robust and generalizable content recommendation architecture, offering practical design insights for semantic retrieval systems in low-resource language settings.

### [508] [Improving Neural Retrieval with Attribution-Guided Query Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11841)
*Moncef Garouani,Josiane Mothe*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve neural retrievers' performance by addressing the issue of ambiguous or underspecified queries using attribution-guided query rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome brittleness in neural retrievers, where ambiguous or underspecified queries lead to ineffective ranking, despite the presence of relevant documents.

Method: The proposed method uses token-level gradient-based attributions from the retriever to guide query rewriting. These attributions are then incorporated as soft guidance in an LLM's structured prompt to clarify queries while maintaining intent.

Result: The approach, evaluated on BEIR collections, consistently enhances retrieval effectiveness, with larger improvements for cases involving ambiguous or implicit queries.

Conclusion: Attribution-guided query rewriting significantly improves neural retrieval systems by clarifying vague or misleading queries via token-level explanation-driven structured prompts to LLMs.

Abstract: Neural retrievers are effective but brittle: underspecified or ambiguous queries can misdirect ranking even when relevant documents exist. Existing approaches address this brittleness only partially: LLMs rewrite queries without retriever feedback, and explainability methods identify misleading tokens but are used for post-hoc analysis. We close this loop and propose an attribution-guided query rewriting method that uses token-level explanations to guide query rewriting. For each query, we compute gradient-based token attributions from the retriever and then use these scores as soft guidance in a structured prompt to an LLM that clarifies weak or misleading query components while preserving intent. Evaluated on BEIR collections, the resulting rewrites consistently improve retrieval effectiveness over strong baselines, with larger gains for implicit or ambiguous information needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of suitable benchmarks for evaluating music retrieval performance necessitated the development of a high-quality and publicly available dataset.

Method: The authors developed IncompeBench, composed of 1,574 licensed music snippets, 500 diverse queries, and 125,000 relevance judgments, created through a multi-stage pipeline to ensure high-quality annotations.

Result: IncompeBench provides publicly available benchmarks for MIR via Hugging Face and GitHub, offering comprehensive support for music retrieval evaluations.

Conclusion: RokomariBG establishes a foundational benchmark and resource for advancing Bangla book recommendation research in low-resource domains. Dataset and code are made publicly available.

Abstract: Personalized book recommendation in Bangla literature has been constrained by the lack of structured, large-scale, and publicly available datasets. This work introduces RokomariBG, a large-scale, multi-entity heterogeneous book graph dataset designed to support research on personalized recommendation in a low-resource language setting. The dataset comprises 127,302 books, 63,723 users, 16,601 authors, 1,515 categories, 2,757 publishers, and 209,602 reviews, connected through eight relation types and organized as a comprehensive knowledge graph.
  To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide a systematic benchmarking study on the Top-N recommendation task, evaluating a diverse set of representative recommendation models, including classical collaborative filtering methods, matrix factorization models, content-based approaches, graph neural networks, a hybrid matrix factorization model with side information, and a neural two-tower retrieval architecture. The benchmarking results highlight the importance of leveraging multi-relational structure and textual side information, with neural retrieval models achieving the strongest performance (NDCG@10 = 0.204). Overall, this work establishes a foundational benchmark and a publicly available resource for Bangla book recommendation research, enabling reproducible evaluation and future studies on recommendation in low-resource cultural domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a comprehensive evaluation environment called SAGEO Arena for optimizing Search-Augmented Generative Engines (SAGE), addressing limitations in existing benchmarks and analyzing structural information in web documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring and improving Search-Augmented Generative Engine Optimization (SAGEO) due to growing interest and lack of realistic evaluation environments.

Method: Development of SAGEO Arena, integrating a generative search pipeline with a large-scale corpus of web documents containing structural information.

Result: Existing optimization approaches are often impractical and degrade performance; structural information mitigates issues and effective optimization requires tailored strategies for each stage.

Conclusion: SAGEO Arena offers a realistic framework for advancing SAGEO evaluation and optimization beyond oversimplified settings by leveraging structural information effectively.

Abstract: Search-Augmented Generative Engines (SAGE) have emerged as a new paradigm for information access, bridging web-scale retrieval with generative capabilities to deliver synthesized answers. This shift has fundamentally reshaped how web content gains exposure online, giving rise to Search-Augmented Generative Engine Optimization (SAGEO), the practice of optimizing web documents to improve their visibility in AI-generated responses. Despite growing interest, no evaluation environment currently supports comprehensive investigation of SAGEO. Specifically, existing benchmarks lack end-to-end visibility evaluation of optimization strategies, operating on pre-determined candidate documents that abstract away retrieval and reranking preceding generation. Moreover, existing benchmarks discard structural information (e.g., schema markup) present in real web documents, overlooking the rich signals that search systems actively leverage in practice. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce SAGEO Arena, a realistic and reproducible environment for stage-level SAGEO analysis. Our objective is to jointly target search-oriented optimization (SEO) and generation-centric optimization (GEO). To achieve this, we integrate a full generative search pipeline over a large-scale corpus of web documents with rich structural information. Our findings reveal that existing approaches remain largely impractical under realistic conditions and often degrade performance in retrieval and reranking. We also find that structural information helps mitigate these limitations, and that effective SAGEO requires tailoring optimization to each pipeline stage. Overall, our benchmark paves the way for realistic SAGEO evaluation and optimization beyond simplified settings.

Result: AttentionRetriever outperformed existing retrieval models in long document tasks, showing both improved effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: AttentionRetriever advances the field of long document retrieval by overcoming current challenges, integrating advanced mechanisms, and achieving leading performance.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to help Large Language Models (LLMs) to process tasks involving long documents. However, existing retrieval models are not designed for long document retrieval and fail to address several key challenges of long document retrieval, including context-awareness, causal dependence, and scope of retrieval. In this paper, we proposed AttentionRetriever, a novel long document retrieval model that leverages attention mechanism and entity-based retrieval to build context-aware embeddings for long document and determine the scope of retrieval. With extensive experiments, we found AttentionRetriever is able to outperform existing retrieval models on long document retrieval datasets by a large margin while remaining as efficient as dense retrieval models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning method to reconstruct traffic density using limited probe vehicle data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately reconstruct traffic density despite the constraint of low penetration rates of probe vehicles.

Method: Measuring the initial and final positions of a small number of cars from microscopic dynamical systems and using a custom machine learning algorithm for density reconstruction.

Result: The learned-based model shows convergence to established macroscopic traffic flow models as vehicle numbers increase.

Conclusion: The proposed method is validated theoretically and efficiently reconstructs traffic density using limited data.

Abstract: We propose an efficient method for reconstructing traffic density with low penetration rate of probe vehicles. Specifically, we rely on measuring only the initial and final positions of a small number of cars which are generated using microscopic dynamical systems. We then implement a machine learning algorithm from scratch to reconstruct the approximate traffic density. This approach leverages learning techniques to improve the accuracy of density reconstruction despite constraints in available data. For the sake of consistency, we will prove that, if only using data from dynamical systems, the approximate density predicted by our learned-based model converges to a well-known macroscopic traffic flow model when the number of vehicles approaches infinity.

TL;DR: This paper studies $(ε,δ)$-differentially private algorithms for approximately computing the top singular vector of a matrix using a private power iteration method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for privacy-preserving methods in computing singular vectors of matrices where data corresponds to sensitive individual datapoints.

Method: The paper utilizes a private variant of the power iteration method with a filtering technique that adapts to the coherence parameter of the input matrix, enhancing utility for matrices with low coherence.

Result: The developed method provides better utility than general worst-case guarantees while ensuring differential privacy within the defined model.

Conclusion: The approach complements prior work by Hardt-Roth and emphasizes adaptable privacy guarantees for matrices based on coherence parameters, thus improving practical applicability.

Abstract: We study $(ε,δ)$-differentially private algorithms for the problem of approximately computing the top singular vector of a matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ where each row of $A$ is a datapoint in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. In our privacy model, neighboring inputs differ by one single row/datapoint. We study the private variant of the power iteration method, which is widely adopted in practice. Our algorithm is based on a filtering technique which adapts to the coherence parameter of the input matrix. This technique provides a utility that goes beyond the worst-case guarantees for matrices with low coherence parameter. Our work departs from and complements the work by Hardt-Roth (STOC 2013) which designed a private power iteration method for the privacy model where neighboring inputs differ in one single entry by at most 1.

TL;DR: This paper proposes and analyzes three lightweight error-correction code encoders based on specific codes for superconducting circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error correction in superconducting circuits is necessary due to errors from flux trapping, defects, and process parameter variations (PPV), while minimizing size and power constraints.

Method: Three lightweight encoders using Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3) codes are proposed and implemented, focusing on SFQ logic. Performance is analyzed under PPV.

Result: The performance of the encoders is evaluated, identifying trade-offs involving theoretical complexity and physical size.

Conclusion: Compact and efficient error-correction encoders are crucial for superconducting circuits, addressing the challenges of PPV and physical constraints.

Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3) codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid neural architecture for modeling wave propagation and scattering in high-contrast media. It combines a Fourier Neural Operator for smooth wave propagation and a vision transformer for high-contrast scattering corrections, resulting in improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by high-contrast settings, such as strong scattering and phase sensitivity in heterogeneous media, which existing neural operators struggle to handle effectively.

Method: The proposed hybrid architecture separates the scattering operator into smooth background propagation (modeled using a Fourier Neural Operator) and high-contrast corrections (handled via a vision transformer with attention mechanisms).

Result: The hybrid model significantly enhances phase and amplitude accuracy in high-frequency Helmholtz problems, particularly in high-contrast scenarios, outperforming standalone FNOs or transformers.

Conclusion: The hybrid model provides a more scalable and accurate surrogate modeling solution for high-contrast wave propagation and scattering problems, demonstrating its potential for applications like seismic imaging.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling of wave propagation and scattering (i.e. the wave speed and source to wave field map) in heterogeneous media has significant potential in applications such as seismic imaging and inversion. High-contrast settings, such as subsurface models with salt bodies, exhibit strong scattering and phase sensitivity that challenge existing neural operators. We propose a hybrid architecture that decomposes the scattering operator into two separate contributions: a smooth background propagation and a high-contrast scattering correction. The smooth component is learned with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which produces globally coupled feature tokens encoding background wave propagation; these tokens are then passed to a vision transformer, where attention is used to model the high-contrast scattering correction dominated by strong, spatial interactions. Evaluated on high-frequency Helmholtz problems with strong contrasts, the hybrid model achieves substantially improved phase and amplitude accuracy compared to standalone FNOs or transformers, with favorable accuracy-parameter scaling.

Abstract: Radar signal recognition in open electromagnetic environments is challenging due to diverse operating modes and unseen radar types. Existing methods often overlook position relations in pulse sequences, limiting their ability to capture semantic dependencies over time. We propose RadarPos, a position-aware self-supervised framework that leverages pulse-level temporal dynamics without complex augmentations or masking, providing improved position relation modeling over contrastive learning or masked reconstruction. Using this framework, we evaluate cross-mode radar signal recognition under the long-tailed setting to assess adaptability and generalization.

*Mikko Honkala,Dani Korpi,Elias Raninen,Janne M. J. Huttunen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces EqDeepRx, a deep-learning-aided MIMO receiver that combines traditional methods with neural networks for improved scalability, explainability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in machine learning-based MIMO receivers, including poor scalability with spatial multiplexing order, lack of explainability, and inadequate generalization.

Method: EqDeepRx employs shared-weight DetectorNNs per spatial stream, conventional channel estimation paired with DenoiseNN, parallel LMMSE and RZF equalizers, and compact DemapperNN for bit decoding.

Result: EqDeepRx demonstrates better error rates and spectral efficiency in 5G/6G simulations across diverse scenarios, while maintaining low complexity and compatibility with varying MIMO configurations.

Conclusion: The integration of engineered ML blocks into traditional receiver processing offers a scalable, explainable, and generalizable approach for advanced MIMO systems.

Abstract: While machine learning (ML)-based receiver algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the recent literature, they often suffer from poor scaling with increasing spatial multiplexing order and lack of explainability and generalization. This paper presents EqDeepRx, a practical deep-learning-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver, which is built by augmenting linear receiver processing with carefully engineered ML blocks. At the core of the receiver model is a shared-weight DetectorNN that operates independently on each spatial stream or layer, enabling near-linear complexity scaling with respect to multiplexing order. To ensure better explainability and generalization, EqDeepRx retains conventional channel estimation and augments it with a lightweight DenoiseNN that learns frequency-domain smoothing. To reduce the dimensionality of the DetectorNN inputs, the receiver utilizes two linear equalizers in parallel: a linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) equalizer with interference-plus-noise covariance estimation and a regularized zero-forcing (RZF) equalizer. The parallel equalized streams are jointly consumed by the DetectorNN, after which a compact DemapperNN produces bit log-likelihood ratios for channel decoding. 5G/6G-compliant end-to-end simulations across multiple channel scenarios, pilot patterns, and inter-cell interference conditions show improved error rate and spectral efficiency over a conventional baseline, while maintaining low-complexity inference and support for different MIMO configurations without retraining.

### [519] [Calibration and Evaluation of Car-Following Models for Autonomous Shuttles Using a Novel Multi-Criteria Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11517)
*Renan Favero,Lily Elefteriadou*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This study focuses on autonomous shuttles' car-following models, using real-world data to calibrate ML-based and physics-based models, and offers a novel evaluation framework. It found XGBoost to perform the best overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of dedicated car-following models for autonomous shuttles using real-world data, and machine learning techniques have not yet been fully explored for this purpose.

Method: The study calibrated diverse car-following models, including eight ML algorithms and two physics-based models, and proposed a multi-criteria evaluation framework integrating prediction accuracy, stability, and statistical similarity.

Result: The XGBoost model achieved the best results, while LSTM and CNN excelled at long-term stability but were less responsive to short-term dynamics. Traditional models and kernel methods were less accurate and stable.

Conclusion: Machine learning models show significant potential for improving car-following models for autonomous shuttles, with XGBoost offering the best overall performance among tested models.

Abstract: Autonomous shuttles (AS) are fully autonomous transit vehicles with operating characteristics distinct from conventional autonomous vehicles (AV). Developing dedicated car-following models for AS is critical to understanding their traffic impacts; however, few studies have calibrated such models with field data. More advanced machine learning (ML) techniques have not yet been applied to AS trajectories, leaving the potential of ML for capturing AS dynamics unexplored and constraining the development of dedicated AS models. Furthermore, there is a lack of a unified framework for systematically evaluating and comparing the performance of car-following models to replicate real trajectories. Existing car-following studies often rely on disparate metrics, which limit reproducibility and performance comparability.
  This study addresses these gaps through two main contributions: (1) the calibration of a diverse set of car-following models using real-world AS trajectory data, including eight machine learning algorithms and two physics-based models; and (2) the introduction of a multi-criteria evaluation framework that integrates measures of prediction accuracy, trajectory stability, and statistical similarity, which provides a generalizable methodology for a systematic assessment of car-following models.
  Results indicated that the proposed calibrated XGBoost model achieved the best overall performance. Sequential model type, such as LSTM and CNN, captured long-term positional stability but were less responsive to short-term dynamics. LSTM and CNN captured long-term positional stability but were less responsive to short-term dynamics. Traditional models (IDM, ACC) and kernel methods showed lower accuracy and stability than most ML models tested.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the NeuralGCM against physics-based Earth system models for synoptic, interannual, and out-of-distribution warming scenarios, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the reliability of machine learning-based models for Earth sciences by addressing their performance across scales and under extreme conditions.

Method: Three sets of experiments were designed to test NeuralGCM's ability to capture synoptic-scale phenomena, interannual variability, and responses under uniform-warming forcings.

Result: NeuralGCM compares favorably with Earth system models at synoptic scales and reproduces some interannual teleconnections, but shows biases under warming scenarios and tropical anomalies.

Conclusion: NeuralGCM demonstrates promise but exhibits specific weaknesses in capturing complex dynamics and warming responses, suggesting areas for improvement in ML-based models for Earth sciences.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based models have demonstrated high skill and computational efficiency, often outperforming conventional physics-based models in weather and subseasonal predictions. While prior studies have assessed their fidelity in capturing synoptic-scale atmospheric dynamics, their performance across timescales and under out-of-distribution forcing, such as +3K or +4K uniform-warming forcings, and the sources of biases remain elusive, to establish the model reliability for Earth science. Here, we design three sets of experiments targeting synoptic-scale phenomena, interannual variability, and out-of-distribution uniform-warming forcings. We evaluate the Neural General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid model integrating a dynamical core with ML-based component, against observations and physics-based Earth system models (ESMs). At the synoptic scale, NeuralGCM captures the evolution and propagation of extratropical cyclones with performance comparable to ESMs. At the interannual scale, when forced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, NeuralGCM successfully reproduces associated teleconnection patterns but exhibits deficiencies in capturing nonlinear response. Under out-of-distribution uniform-warming forcings, NeuralGCM simulates similar responses in global-average temperature and precipitation and reproduces large-scale tropospheric circulation features similar to those in ESMs. Notable weaknesses include overestimating the tracks and spatial extent of extratropical cyclones, biases in the teleconnected wave train triggered by tropical SST anomalies, and differences in upper-level warming and stratospheric circulation responses to SST warming compared to physics-based ESMs. The causes of these weaknesses were explored.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between interpretable yet rigid models and flexible but opaque black-box approaches in optimizing individualized treatment decisions.

Method: LI-ITR integrates variational autoencoders for generating realistic synthetic samples and combines them with a mixture of interpretable experts to derive subject-specific treatment rules.

Result: Simulation studies show that LI-ITR accurately identifies subject-specific coefficients and treatment strategies. Its application in breast cancer side-effect management demonstrates its predictive performance and clinical interpretability.

Conclusion: LI-ITR is an innovative and practical approach that balances flexibility and transparency, making it a valuable tool for individualized healthcare decision-making.

Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) aim to optimize healthcare by tailoring treatment decisions to patient-specific characteristics. Existing methods typically rely on either interpretable but inflexible models or highly flexible black-box approaches that sacrifice interpretability; moreover, most impose a single global decision rule across patients. We introduce the Locally Interpretable Individualized Treatment Rule (LI-ITR) method, which combines flexible machine learning models to accurately learn complex treatment outcomes with locally interpretable approximations to construct subject-specific treatment rules. LI-ITR employs variational autoencoders to generate realistic local synthetic samples and learns individualized decision rules through a mixture of interpretable experts. Simulation studies show that LI-ITR accurately recovers true subject-specific local coefficients and optimal treatment strategies. An application to precision side-effect management in breast cancer illustrates the necessity of flexible predictive modeling and highlights the practical utility of LI-ITR in estimating optimal treatment rules while providing transparent, clinically interpretable explanations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Yaksha-Prashna, a system that enables cloud operators and developers to verify the functional correctness of eBPF bytecodes without disclosing their source code, enhancing security, observability, and load balancing use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Third-party eBPF-based network functions are increasingly used in cloud organizations for critical use cases. However, these are provided only in bytecode format, leaving operators with limited visibility into their correctness and interactions. Furthermore, developers need a way to prove the correctness of their work without revealing sensitive code.

Method: The proposed Yaksha-Prashna system utilizes domain-specific models for scalable program analysis of eBPF programs. It offers a query language for asserting and testing the conformance of bytecode to specifications and dependencies.

Result: The system verifies functional properties of bytecodes with up to 1000x speedup compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability in analyzing eBPF-based network functions.

Conclusion: Yaksha-Prashna improves the trustworthiness and usability of eBPF-based network functions through efficient verification mechanisms, addressing cloud operators’ and developers’ challenges around correctness and confidentiality.

Abstract: Many cloud infrastructure organizations increasingly rely on third-party eBPF-based network functions for use cases like security, observability, and load balancing, so that not everyone requires a team of highly skilled eBPF experts. However, the network functions from third parties (e.g., F5, Palo Alto) are available in bytecode format to cloud operators, giving little or no understanding of their functional correctness and interaction with other network functions in a chain. Also, eBPF developers want to provide proof of functional correctness for their developed network functions without disclosing the source code to the operators. We design Yaksha-Prashna, a system that allows operators/developers to assert and query bytecode's conformance to its specification and dependencies on other bytecodes. Our work builds domain-specific models that enable us to employ scalable program analysis to extract and model eBPF programs. Using Yaksha-Prashna language, we express 24 properties on standard and non-standard eBPF-based network functions with 200-1000x speedup over the state-of-the-art work.

*Md Sazedur Rahman,Mizanur Rahman Jewel,Sanjay Madria*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified safety and security architecture for intelligent mining systems, addressing constraints like poor connectivity, cyber physical threats, and energy depletion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a resilient, trustworthy intelligent mining system capable of functioning in challenging environments with adversarial conditions.

Method: The framework integrates multimodal perception, secure federated learning, reinforcement learning, DTN communication, and energy-aware sensing.

Result: Proposed five core modules which enhance miner localization, situational awareness, federated learning robustness, and equipment health monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework offers promising advancements for mining safety, operational reliability, and tackling cyber physical threats in harsh conditions.

Abstract: Mining is rapidly evolving into an AI driven cyber physical ecosystem where safety and operational reliability depend on robust perception, trustworthy distributed intelligence, and continuous monitoring of miners and equipment. However, real world mining environments impose severe constraints, including poor illumination, GPS denied conditions, irregular underground topologies and intermittent connectivity. These factors degrade perception accuracy, disrupt situational awareness and weaken distributed learning systems. At the same time, emerging cyber physical threats such as backdoor triggers, sensor spoofing, label flipping attacks, and poisoned model updates further jeopardize operational safety as mines adopt autonomous vehicles, humanoid assistance, and federated learning for collaborative intelligence. Energy constrained sensors also experience uneven battery depletion, creating blind spots in safety coverage and disrupting hazard detection pipelines. This paper presents a vision for a Unified Smart Safety and Security Architecture that integrates multimodal perception, secure federated learning, reinforcement learning, DTN enabled communication, and energy aware sensing into a cohesive safety framework. We introduce five core modules: Miner Finder, Multimodal Situational Awareness, Backdoor Attack Monitor, TrustFed LFD, and IoT driven Equipment Health Monitoring. These modules collectively address miner localization, hazard understanding, federated robustness, and predictive maintenance. Together, they form an end to end framework capable of guiding miners through obstructed pathways, identifying compromised models or sensors, and ensuring mission critical equipment reliability. This work outlines a comprehensive research vision for building a resilient and trustworthy intelligent mining system capable of maintaining operational continuity under adversarial conditions.

### [524] [LoRA-based Parameter-Efficient LLMs for Continuous Learning in Edge-based Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11655)
*Christian Rondanini,Barbara Carminati,Elena Ferrari,Niccolò Lardo,Ashish Kundu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a continuous learning architecture using lightweight transformer models and LoRA adapters for real-time edge-based malware detection, achieving significant accuracy gains under evolving threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of edge devices necessitates advanced security solutions for real-time malware detection under strict computational constraints and evolving threats.

Method: The paper introduces lightweight transformer models fine-tuned locally with the LoRA adapter approach, enabling efficient parameter sharing and cross-device generalization without sharing raw data.

Result: Evaluations on public IoT datasets show up to 20-25% accuracy improvement in detecting unseen attacks, stable performance across rounds, and practical model size updates for edge hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed LoRA-based architecture effectively addresses the challenges in edge malware detection, providing scalable, adaptable, and efficient security solutions for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: The proliferation of edge devices has created an urgent need for security solutions capable of detecting malware in real time while operating under strict computational and memory constraints. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recognizing complex patterns, yet their deployment on edge devices remains impractical due to their resource demands. However, in edge malware detection, static or centrally retrained models degrade under evolving threats and heterogeneous traffic; locally trained models become siloed and fail to transfer across domains. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we present a continuous learning architecture for edge-based malware detection that combines local adaptation on each device with global knowledge sharing through parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Lightweight transformer models (DistilBERT, DistilGPT-2, TinyT5) run on edge nodes and are incrementally fine-tuned on device-specific traffic; only the resulting LoRA modules are aggregated by a lightweight coordinator and redistributed, enabling cross-device generalization without exchanging raw data. We evaluate on two public IoT security datasets, Edge-IIoTset and TON-IoT, under multi-round learning to simulate evolving threats. Compared to isolated fine-tuning, the LoRA-based exchange yields up to 20-25% accuracy gains when models encounter previously unseen attacks from another domain, while maintaining stable loss and F1 across rounds. LoRA adds less than 1% to model size (~0.6-1.8 MB), making updates practical for constrained edge hardware.

### [525] [Legitimate Overrides in Decentralized Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12260)
*Oghenekaro Elem,Nimrod Talmon*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the design of emergency mechanisms in decentralized protocols, focusing on balancing trust and discretion in interventions for mitigating exploit losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized protocols require mechanisms to respond to systemic failures and exploits without losing user trust or appearing illegitimate.

Method: The authors propose a Scope × Authority taxonomy to classify emergency architectures, formalize trade-offs as a stochastic minimization problem, and test predictions against documented incidents.

Result: Containment time varies by authority type, exploit losses are concentrated in rare catastrophic events, and community sentiment affects the cost of intervention capability.

Conclusion: Quantitative principles for designing emergency governance mechanisms provide a framework to move beyond ideological debates in decentralized systems.

Abstract: Decentralized protocols claim immutable, rule-based execution, yet many embed emergency mechanisms such as chain-level freezes, protocol pauses, and account quarantines. These overrides are crucial for responding to exploits and systemic failures, but they expose a core tension: when does intervention preserve trust and when is it perceived as illegitimate discretion? With approximately $10$ billion in technical exploit losses potentially addressable by onchain intervention (2016--2026), the design of these mechanisms has high practical stakes, but current approaches remain ad hoc and ideologically charged. We address this gap by developing a Scope $\times$ Authority taxonomy that maps the design space of emergency architectures along two dimensions: the precision of the intervention and the concentration of trigger authority. We formalize the resulting tradeoffs of a standing centralization cost versus containment speed and collateral disruption as a stochastic cost-minimization problem; and derive three testable predictions. Assessing these predictions against 705 documented exploit incidents, we find that containment time varies systematically by authority type; that losses follow a heavy-tailed distribution ($α\approx 1.33$) concentrating risk in rare catastrophic events; and that community sentiment measurably modulates the effective cost of maintaining intervention capability. The analysis yields concrete design principles that move emergency governance from ideological debate towards quantitative engineering.

### [526] [Transferable Backdoor Attacks for Code Models via Sharpness-Aware Adversarial Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11213)
*Shuyu Chang,Haiping Huang,Yanjun Zhang,Yujin Huang,Fu Xiao,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sharpness-aware Transferable Adversarial Backdoor (STAB), a method attacking code models effectively by balancing both transferability and stealthiness, surpassing previous techniques under defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, and existing methods struggle to achieve both transferability across datasets and stealthiness to evade detection. This paper aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: STAB leverages Sharpness-Aware Minimization to focus adversarial perturbations on flat loss landscape regions for better transferability. It uses Gumbel-Softmax optimization for generating adaptive triggers in discrete token spaces.

Result: STAB achieves improved attack success rates under defense and better cross-dataset transferability compared to prior methods, maintaining clean input performance.

Conclusion: The proposed STAB approach effectively reconciles the trade-offs between stealthiness and transferability in backdoor attacks, setting a new benchmark in code model vulnerability exploitation.

Abstract: Code models are increasingly adopted in software development but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks via poisoned training data. Existing backdoor attacks on code models face a fundamental trade-off between transferability and stealthiness. Static trigger-based attacks insert fixed dead code patterns that transfer well across models and datasets but are easily detected by code-specific defenses. In contrast, dynamic trigger-based attacks adaptively generate context-aware triggers to evade detection but suffer from poor cross-dataset transferability. Moreover, they rely on unrealistic assumptions of identical data distributions between poisoned and victim training data, limiting their practicality. To overcome these limitations, we propose Sharpness-aware Transferable Adversarial Backdoor (STAB), a novel attack that achieves both transferability and stealthiness without requiring complete victim data. STAB is motivated by the observation that adversarial perturbations in flat regions of the loss landscape transfer more effectively across datasets than those in sharp minima. To this end, we train a surrogate model using Sharpness-Aware Minimization to guide model parameters toward flat loss regions, and employ Gumbel-Softmax optimization to enable differentiable search over discrete trigger tokens for generating context-aware adversarial triggers. Experiments across three datasets and two code models show that STAB outperforms prior attacks in terms of transferability and stealthiness. It achieves a 73.2% average attack success rate after defense, outperforming static trigger-based attacks that fail under defense. STAB also surpasses the best dynamic trigger-based attack by 12.4% in cross-dataset attack success rate and maintains performance on clean inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prevalence of zero-day cyberattacks in IoT networks and the limitations of existing machine learning methods under challenges like encrypted traffic and data scarcity.

Method: SiamXBERT combines Siamese meta-learning with a transformer language model, incorporating dual-modality feature representation to analyze flow-level and packet-level data for better generalization to unknown attacks.

Result: SiamXBERT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in IoT intrusion datasets, achieving up to 78.8% improvement in F1-score for unknown attack detection with less training data.

Conclusion: SiamXBERT is an effective and practical solution for detecting unknown attacks in IoT environments even with limited labeled data.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of cyberattacks continues to drive the emergence of unknown (zero-day) threats, posing significant challenges for network intrusion detection systems in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Existing machine learning and deep learning approaches typically rely on large labeled datasets, payload inspection, or closed-set classification, limiting their effectiveness under data scarcity, encrypted traffic, and distribution shifts. Consequently, detecting unknown attacks in realistic IoT deployments remains difficult. To address these limitations, we propose SiamXBERT, a robust and data-efficient Siamese meta-learning framework empowered by a transformer-based language model for unknown attack detection. The proposed approach constructs a dual-modality feature representation by integrating flow-level and packet-level information, enabling richer behavioral modeling while remaining compatible with encrypted traffic. Through meta-learning, the model rapidly adapts to new attack types using only a small number of labeled samples and generalizes to previously unseen behaviors. Extensive experiments on representative IoT intrusion datasets demonstrate that SiamXBERT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both within-dataset and cross-dataset settings while requiring significantly less training data, achieving up to \num{78.8}\% improvement in unknown F1-score. These results highlight the practicality of SiamXBERT for robust unknown attack detection in real-world IoT environments.

*Sri Durga Sai Sowmya Kadali,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study introduces a latent representation framework to detect and block jailbreaks in large language models (LLMs) by examining internal behaviors without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defense mechanisms against jailbreaks rely heavily on prompt-level defenses, which attackers adapt to. A deeper examination of LLMs' internal behavior could provide a more effective security approach.

Method: The authors conduct layer-wise analysis on several open-source LLMs to identify internal patterns associated with jailbreaks. They introduce a tensor-based latent representation framework for detecting and disrupting them during inference, without model fine-tuning.

Result: Their approach blocks 78% of jailbreak attempts and maintains 94% benign prompt functionality on a test model while operating with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Identifiable internal structures in LLMs correlate with jailbreak vulnerabilities. The proposed framework offers an architecture-agnostic and scalable method to enhance LLM security.

Abstract: Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a critical security challenge with the widespread deployment of conversational AI systems. Adversarial users exploit these models through carefully crafted prompts to elicit restricted or unsafe outputs, a phenomenon commonly referred to as Jailbreaking. Despite numerous proposed defense mechanisms, attackers continue to develop adaptive prompting strategies, and existing models remain vulnerable. This motivates approaches that examine the internal behavior of LLMs rather than relying solely on prompt-level defenses. In this work, we study jailbreaking from both security and interpretability perspectives by analyzing how internal representations differ between jailbreak and benign prompts. We conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis across multiple open-source models, including GPT-J, LLaMA, Mistral, and the state-space model Mamba, and identify consistent latent-space patterns associated with harmful inputs. We then propose a tensor-based latent representation framework that captures structure in hidden activations and enables lightweight jailbreak detection without model fine-tuning or auxiliary LLM-based detectors. We further demonstrate that the latent signals can be used to actively disrupt jailbreak execution at inference time. On an abliterated LLaMA-3.1-8B model, selectively bypassing high-susceptibility layers blocks 78% of jailbreak attempts while preserving benign behavior on 94% of benign prompts. This intervention operates entirely at inference time and introduces minimal overhead, providing a scalable foundation for achieving stronger coverage by incorporating additional attack distributions or more refined susceptibility thresholds. Our results provide evidence that jailbreak behavior is rooted in identifiable internal structures and suggest a complementary, architecture-agnostic direction for improving LLM security.

*Dong Yan,Jian Liang,Ran He,Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRACE-RPS, a defense against privacy breaches by LLMs that anonymizes user data and prevents attribute inference, successfully reducing inference accuracy to below 5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models can infer private user attributes from text, leading to privacy breaches; existing defenses lack precision and effectiveness in preventing this.

Method: The authors propose TRACE-RPS, a unified framework combining TRACE (fine-grained anonymization using attention mechanisms) and RPS (optimization inducing model rejection behaviors).

Result: TRACE-RPS significantly reduces attribute inference accuracy from ~50% to below 5%, with strong generalization and robustness across language models.

Conclusion: TRACE-RPS provides an effective solution for safeguarding user privacy against LLM inference, balancing utility and privacy.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can infer private user attributes (e.g., age, location, gender) from user-generated text shared online, enabling rapid and large-scale privacy breaches. Existing anonymization-based defenses are coarse-grained, lacking word-level precision in anonymizing privacy-leaking elements. Moreover, they are inherently limited as altering user text to hide sensitive cues still allows attribute inference to occur through models' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a unified defense framework that combines fine-grained anonymization (TRACE) with inference-preventing optimization (RPS). TRACE leverages attention mechanisms and inference chain generation to identify and anonymize privacy-leaking textual elements, while RPS employs a lightweight two-stage optimization strategy to induce model rejection behaviors, thereby preventing attribute inference. Evaluations across diverse LLMs show that TRACE-RPS reduces attribute inference accuracy from around 50\% to below 5\% on open-source models. In addition, our approach offers strong cross-model generalization, prompt-variation robustness, and utility-privacy tradeoffs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jasper-Yan/TRACE-RPS.

*Ruibo Chen,Yihan Wu,Xuehao Cui,Jingqi Zhang,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Watermarking methods for content detection in large language models are improved by using weaker single-layer watermarks to maintain token entropy, enhancing detectability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust watermarking techniques face a trade-off between strong signals and the entropy required for detecting watermarks effectively, limiting their performance.

Method: We propose a framework employing weaker watermarks at single layers, preserving entropy for more effective multi-layer watermark ensembling.

Result: Empirical evaluations confirm the approach mitigates signal decay and achieves better detectability and robustness compared to strong watermark baselines.

Conclusion: A weaker-is-better strategy for watermarking can overcome the challenges of entropy reduction, enhancing effectiveness in multi-layer setups.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a crucial technique for detecting and attributing content generated by large language models. While recent advancements have utilized watermark ensembles to enhance robustness, prevailing methods typically prioritize maximizing the strength of the watermark at every individual layer. In this work, we identify a critical limitation in this "stronger-is-better" approach: strong watermarks significantly reduce the entropy of the token distribution, which paradoxically weakens the effectiveness of watermarking in subsequent layers. We theoretically and empirically show that detectability is bounded by entropy and that watermark ensembles induce a monotonic decrease in both entropy and the expected green-list ratio across layers. To address this inherent trade-off, we propose a general framework that utilizes weaker single-layer watermarks to preserve the entropy required for effective multi-layer ensembling. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this counter-intuitive strategy mitigates signal decay and consistently outperforms strong baselines in both detectability and robustness.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CryptoAnalystBench, an evaluation framework investigating LLM failures in high data density domains like crypto, providing tools, benchmarks, error taxonomy, and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of studies on LLMs integrating dynamic, structured, and unstructured multi-tool outputs, focusing on their performance in handling high volumes of complex, sensitive data.

Method: Develop an analyst benchmark (CryptoAnalystBench), agentic harness with crypto/DeFi tools, evaluation pipeline with citation verification, error taxonomy, and judge rubrics for assessing LLM performance across specific dimensions.

Result: Failures are identified in state-of-the-art LLMs associated with relevance, temporal relevance, depth, and data consistency; critical error modes are developed into iterative rubrics; the judge reliably detects major issues.

Conclusion: The framework helps pinpoint key failure modes, aiding iterative improvements for LLM-agent systems, and facilitates scalable evaluation of long-form, tool-augmented outputs. Released resources aim to enhance future research and development.

Abstract: Modern analyst agents must reason over complex, high token inputs, including dozens of retrieved documents, tool outputs, and time sensitive data. While prior work has produced tool calling benchmarks and examined factuality in knowledge augmented systems, relatively little work studies their intersection: settings where LLMs must integrate large volumes of dynamic, structured and unstructured multi tool outputs. We investigate LLM failure modes in this regime using crypto as a representative high data density domain. We introduce (1) CryptoAnalystBench, an analyst aligned benchmark of 198 production crypto and DeFi queries spanning 11 categories; (2) an agentic harness equipped with relevant crypto and DeFi tools to generate responses across multiple frontier LLMs; and (3) an evaluation pipeline with citation verification and an LLM as a judge rubric spanning four user defined success dimensions: relevance, temporal relevance, depth, and data consistency. Using human annotation, we develop a taxonomy of seven higher order error types that are not reliably captured by factuality checks or LLM based quality scoring. We find that these failures persist even in state of the art systems and can compromise high stakes decisions. Based on this taxonomy, we refine the judge rubric to better capture these errors. While the judge does not align with human annotators on precise scoring across rubric iterations, it reliably identifies critical failure modes, enabling scalable feedback for developers and researchers studying analyst style agents. We release CryptoAnalystBench with annotated queries, the evaluation pipeline, judge rubrics, and the error taxonomy, and outline mitigation strategies and open challenges in evaluating long form, multi tool augmented systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the security aspects of emerging AI agent communication protocols, offering a threat modeling framework and risk assessment methods to enhance protocol design and secure deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of AI communication protocols raises concerns about their security due to limited research and lack of standardized threat modeling or risk frameworks.

Method: A structured threat modeling analysis, qualitative risk assessment framework, and a measurement-driven case study on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) were conducted to identify risks and assess security posture.

Result: The paper identifies twelve protocol-level risks and evaluates security issues related to protocol lifecycle phases. A specific risk in MCP is measured through a case study focusing on missing validation/attestation for executable components.

Conclusion: The study provides key insights into design-induced risk surfaces and offers actionable recommendations for secure deployment and standardization in AI communication ecosystems.

Abstract: The rapid development of the AI agent communication protocols, including the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent2Agent (A2A), Agora, and Agent Network Protocol (ANP), is reshaping how AI agents communicate with tools, services, and each other. While these protocols support scalable multi-agent interaction and cross-organizational interoperability, their security principles remain understudied, and standardized threat modeling is limited; no protocol-centric risk assessment framework has been established yet. This paper presents a systematic security analysis of four emerging AI agent communication protocols. First, we develop a structured threat modeling analysis that examines protocol architectures, trust assumptions, interaction patterns, and lifecycle behaviors to identify protocol-specific and cross-protocol risk surfaces. Second, we introduce a qualitative risk assessment framework that identifies twelve protocol-level risks and evaluates security posture across the creation, operation, and update phases through systematic assessment of likelihood, impact, and overall protocol risk, with implications for secure deployment and future standardization. Third, we provide a measurement-driven case study on MCP that formalizes the risk of missing mandatory validation/attestation for executable components as a falsifiable security claim by quantifying wrong-provider tool execution under multi-server composition across representative resolver policies. Collectively, our results highlight key design-induced risk surfaces and provide actionable guidance for secure deployment and future standardization of agent communication ecosystems.

*Yujie Gu,Richeng Jin,Xiaoyu Ji,Yier Jin,Wenyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEL, a framework enabling efficient and private LLM inference with reduced communication and privacy enhancements through embedding projection and stochastic quantization, as well as using server-side soft prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of computational demands and privacy concerns in LLM inference, particularly for devices with limited resources.

Method: DEL combines embedding projection, differentially private stochastic quantization for communication efficiency, and server-side soft prompts to compensate for degraded utility while eliminating local models.

Result: DEL demonstrates improved trade-offs between privacy and utility through experiments on text generation and natural language understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: DEL provides a novel and practical solution to privacy and efficiency challenges in LLM inference, demonstrating its effectiveness for both text generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance and received significant research interest. The enormous computational demands, however, hinder the local deployment on devices with limited resources. The current prevalent LLM inference paradigms require users to send queries to the service providers for processing, which raises critical privacy concerns. Existing approaches propose to allow the users to obfuscate the token embeddings before transmission and utilize local models for denoising. Nonetheless, transmitting the token embeddings and deploying local models may result in excessive communication and computation overhead, preventing practical implementation. In this work, we propose \textbf{DEL}, a framework for \textbf{D}ifferentially private and communication \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{L}LM split inference. More specifically, an embedding projection module and a differentially private stochastic quantization mechanism are proposed to reduce the communication overhead in a privacy-preserving manner. To eliminate the need for local models, we adapt soft prompt at the server side to compensate for the utility degradation caused by privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes soft prompt to improve the trade-off between privacy and utility in LLM inference, and extensive experiments on text generation and natural language understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [534] [DMind-3: A Sovereign Edge--Local--Cloud AI System with Controlled Deliberation and Correction-Based Tuning for Safe, Low-Latency Transaction Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11651)
*Enhao Huang,Frank Li,Tony Lin,Lowes Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DMind-3 is a distributed intelligence stack designed to secure financial execution in Web3 by combining edge, local, and cloud components for privacy, safety, and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems either compromise privacy in cloud environments or lack global context in purely local setups. DMind-3 addresses the need for secure, privacy-preserving, and context-aware execution in Web3 settings.

Method: It introduces three layers: an edge-based intent firewall, a local reasoning engine, and a cloud-based global context synthesizer, utilizing novel training algorithms for efficient computation routing and robust verification.

Result: DMind-3 achieved a 93.7% multi-turn success rate in protocol-constrained environments and superior reasoning performance compared to traditional systems.

Conclusion: DMind-3 offers a scalable, privacy-focused framework binding user intent safety with edge execution, resolving the conflicts between privacy, global context, and latency.

Abstract: This paper introduces DMind-3, a sovereign Edge-Local-Cloud intelligence stack designed to secure irreversible financial execution in Web3 environments against adversarial risks and strict latency constraints. While existing cloud-centric assistants compromise privacy and fail under network congestion, and purely local solutions lack global ecosystem context, DMind-3 resolves these tensions by decomposing capability into three cooperating layers: a deterministic signing-time intent firewall at the edge, a private high-fidelity reasoning engine on user hardware, and a policy-governed global context synthesizer in the cloud. We propose policy-driven selective offloading to route computation based on privacy sensitivity and uncertainty, supported by two novel training objectives: Hierarchical Predictive Synthesis (HPS) for fusing time-varying macro signals, and Contrastive Chain-of-Correction Supervised Fine-Tuning (C$^3$-SFT) to enhance local verification reliability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DMind-3 achieves a 93.7% multi-turn success rate in protocol-constrained tasks and superior domain reasoning compared to general-purpose baselines, providing a scalable framework where safety is bound to the edge execution primitive while maintaining sovereignty over sensitive user intent.

TL;DR: The paper addresses indirect prompt injection attacks on AI agents by proposing a security-aware design that enhances autonomy while maintaining security and task utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of indirect prompt injection attacks and the need for costly system-level defenses that often reduce task efficiency.

Method: Introduces autonomy metrics for assessing agent independence, implements richer human-in-the-loop interactions, and integrates explicit task planning and policy compliance in a system-level defense approach.

Result: Achieved higher autonomy in AI agents without compromising security and task utility, demonstrated through AgentDojo and WASP benchmark evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed security-aware agent design significantly improves autonomy by reducing human oversight requirements, showing an advancement over traditional system-level defenses.

Abstract: Indirect prompt injection attacks threaten AI agents that execute consequential actions, motivating deterministic system-level defenses. Such defenses can provably block unsafe actions by enforcing confidentiality and integrity policies, but currently appear costly: they reduce task completion rates and increase token usage compared to probabilistic defenses. We argue that existing evaluations miss a key benefit of system-level defenses: reduced reliance on human oversight. We introduce autonomy metrics to quantify this benefit: the fraction of consequential actions an agent can execute without human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval while preserving security. To increase autonomy, we design a security-aware agent that (i) introduces richer HITL interactions, and (ii) explicitly plans for both task progress and policy compliance. We implement this agent design atop an existing information-flow control defense against prompt injection and evaluate it on the AgentDojo and WASP benchmarks. Experiments show that this approach yields higher autonomy without sacrificing utility.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDS) framework for distributed environments, emphasizing adaptive detector allocation and minimal computational resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the need for adaptable CIDS architectures to counter dynamic cyberattack scenarios in distributed critical infrastructure such as drones.

Method: Proposed a novel CIDS framework optimized for deployment in diverse settings by dynamically reallocating detectors based on resources and data types. Evaluated using distributed datasets and a new drone-based cyberattack scenario.

Result: The framework achieved efficient intrusion detection in distributed environments and demonstrated its ability to automatically reconfigure detectors optimally on edge devices.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical and adaptable solution for intrusion detection in dynamic and distributed environments, achieving efficiency without heavy computational requirements.

Abstract: Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDS) are increasingly adopted to counter cyberattacks, as their collaborative nature enables them to adapt to diverse scenarios across heterogeneous environments. As distributed critical infrastructure operates in rapidly evolving environments, such as drones in both civil and military domains, there is a growing need for CIDS architectures that can flexibly accommodate these dynamic changes. In this study, we propose a novel CIDS framework designed for easy deployment across diverse distributed environments. The framework dynamically optimizes detector allocation per node based on available resources and data types, enabling rapid adaptation to new operational scenarios with minimal computational overhead. We first conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify key characteristics of existing CIDS architectures. Based on these insights and real-world use cases, we developed our CIDS framework, which we evaluated using several distributed datasets that feature different attack chains and network topologies. Notably, we introduce a public dataset based on a realistic cyberattack targeting a ground drone aimed at sabotaging critical infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CIDS framework can achieve adaptive, efficient intrusion detection in distributed settings, automatically reconfiguring detectors to maintain an optimal configuration, without requiring heavy computation, since all experiments were conducted on edge devices.

### [537] [Agentic AI for Cybersecurity: A Meta-Cognitive Architecture for Governable Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11897)
*Andrei Kojukhov,Arkady Bovshover*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Current AI-driven cybersecurity systems focus on performance metrics like accuracy but falter in accountable decision-making under adversarial uncertainty. This paper proposes reconceptualizing these systems as multi-agent cognitive frameworks, incorporating a meta-cognitive judgment function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of linear AI-driven cybersecurity systems in handling adversarial uncertainty and decision accountability, advocating for a multi-agent cognitive approach.

Method: The framework combines distributed cognition theory, multi-agent systems, and responsible AI governance, introducing a meta-cognitive judgment function to coordinate heterogeneous agents.

Result: Demonstrates that security operations function as distributed cognitive systems but lack explicit organizing principles, proposes embedding meta-cognitive judgment for improved governance.

Conclusion: Shifts AI in cybersecurity from task-based optimization to autonomy governance under uncertainty, improving decision accountability and regulatory alignment for next-gen systems.

Abstract: Contemporary AI-driven cybersecurity systems are predominantly architected as model-centric detection and automation pipelines optimized for task-level performance metrics such as accuracy and response latency. While effective for bounded classification tasks, these architectures struggle to support accountable decision-making under adversarial uncertainty, where actions must be justified, governed, and aligned with organizational and regulatory constraints. This paper argues that cybersecurity orchestration should be reconceptualized as an agentic, multi-agent cognitive system, rather than a linear sequence of detection and response components. We introduce a conceptual architectural framework in which heterogeneous AI agents responsible for detection, hypothesis formation, contextual interpretation, explanation, and governance are coordinated through an explicit meta-cognitive judgement function. This function governs decision readiness and dynamically calibrates system autonomy when evidence is incomplete, conflicting, or operationally risky. By synthesizing distributed cognition theory, multi-agent systems research, and responsible AI governance frameworks, we demonstrate that modern security operations already function as distributed cognitive systems, albeit without an explicit organizing principle. Our contribution is to make this cognitive structure architecturally explicit and governable by embedding meta-cognitive judgement as a first-class system function. We discuss implications for security operations centers, accountable autonomy, and the design of next-generation AI-enabled cyber defence architectures. The proposed framework shifts the focus of AI in cybersecurity from optimizing isolated predictions to governing autonomy under uncertainty.

### [538] [DeepRed: an architecture for redshift estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11281)
*Alessandro Meroni,Nicolò Oreste Pinciroli Vago,Piero Fraternali*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: DeepRed is a deep learning pipeline for redshift estimation using modern computer vision architectures, achieving state-of-the-art results across simulated and real astrophysics datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Redshift estimation in astrophysics is crucial but challenging, requiring cost-effective methods capable of generalizing across diverse astronomical objects and conditions.

Method: DeepRed employs advanced architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, benchmarking these against existing methods on both simulated and real datasets.

Result: The approach significantly improves Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation across multiple datasets, outperforming baselines by notable margins and providing reliable predictions with high localization accuracy.

Conclusion: DeepRed establishes deep learning as a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for estimating redshifts in large-scale astronomical surveys.

Abstract: Estimating redshift is a central task in astrophysics, but its measurement is costly and time-consuming. In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys.
